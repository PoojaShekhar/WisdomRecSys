Circus cited some technicality that wasn't followed.

(taxicab was sliding, i thought the driver was drunk. he blamed black ice).  saw a show, saw the mgm building, got married at a chapel and returned on the return bus to oaktown.\n\nnothing unusual happened on that birthday. \n\noh this circus is lv? my bad! meant to post for reno circus circus.
