And I am missing the meat, they were lackluster gravy fries, still good, just by now means poutine.\nKnowing that would be a meal in itself I went with a salad and added a veggie burger patty instead of getting the veggie burger itself.\nDescent size salad, pretty good veggie patty, thick and loaded with veggies, fried nicely, though comes in frozen, not made in house.\nThe mac and cheese burger, huge and the best thing here. My husband had the hangover burger which he also enjoyed as well as the philly fries which were again not that great in quality.\nNot a fan of cheese sauce, these would have been much better with real cheddar.\nIn all a descent meal for a better price than most other burger places in casinos, but no reason to come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BeSDpZgoDwYfTMUBJQwdEQ"}
