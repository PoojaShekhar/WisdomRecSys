You don't here about the great music scene this town has so this cafe seems to stick out like a sore thumb in retiree central.

These hunts proved to be more difficult than what I wanted and Steven grew more annoyed with me as I did my badge chasing. I found out about Pink Taco off of the Foursquare website as a valid check in to getting the Hard Rock Hotel badge. Not only were we staying right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel but the idea that they might be serving pink tacos peaked my interest.\nOne thing I simply love about Las Vegas is that it truly is a city that never sleeps and stores and restaurants are open to the farthest reaches of the night. Pink Taco is no exception. The night we went it was just about to get busy and lengthy waits for a table were about to ensue. We squeezed in just the nick of time. \nOnce we got seated we had some pretty delicious chips and salsa to eat. At times it seemed like the waiter was spread too thin and there were about two times when we were wondering if we would ever see him again. He forgot our silverware as well but once we were able to get him he seemed eager to please and cheery about his work.\nI mentioned that the chips were good and indeed they were! I of course had to order the pink tacos. The tacos were chicken tacos that had a purposeful pink hue to them. They were tasty but not by any means really authentic. Not bad eats though.\nOut of the casino restaurants that we hit on this trip I would have to say that Pink Taco was the best one I went to on this trip!", "type": "review", "business_id": "UEUQS4z7s-DRzQjky92KYw"}

That though is only half the story and I will tell the full spectrum of that story at a later time.\nWe chose Triple 7 simply because they had a good overall score here on Yelp! They also had brews that I haven't heard of before. Like a Watermelon Hefeweizen! Well by the time we got there they didn't have the Watermelon Hefe anymore but they did have a Mango Hefe which I immediately ordered! This unusual Hefe went down smooth and tasted awesome. But only one beer allowed for this bird!\nThe food at Triple 7 I could have take it or leave it. It is funny. Many people often say how good casino food is and how cheap it is. On this trip at least not so much. The food is mid priced I would say and often times is sub par to a regular restaurant outside The Strip. \nI ordered a Taco Salad here and it tasted fresh enough but also seemed uninspired and didn't really have the TLC needed to make it a good dish. The guacamole also tasted a bit odd. \nIf Triple 7 didn't have such good beer I would not have been so generous on the star giving. The food didn't impress me and was one of my least favorite meals.

This year Las Vegas was chosen! Steven and I wanted to keep it simple and not go to too many night shows and take it easy. Things got a bit more complicated than we would have liked but Vegas is a complicated city!\nOne of the stops we had in mind was going to the Fremont Street Experience. As another reviewer said it is a cross of old school Vegas with elements of The Strip. There are the old buildings but there is also the high tech gadgetry as well. \nI wasn't too sure what to expect from Fremont Street but I was a bit disappointed overall. Perhaps I was looking for the high end shopping of The Strip but most of the stores here were your typical tourist shops selling t-shirts and key chains. There were street vendors selling food to the throngs of people lining up to see bands imitate metal bands of yesteryear as well as individuals dressing up as celebrities.\nProbably my favorite part of the Fremont Street Experience was the portion of the mall (if that is what you want to call it) where there is an enclosed roof and the inside of it is a giant television screen where the images change at a rapid rate and at times feels like you are undergoing a acid trip. Another thing that was really cool was the ride where you climb on a ladder and ride through the air on a cable for about less than half of the span of the mall.\nI wouldn't label Fremont Street as a do or die destination while in Vegas.

For instance some people wrinkle their nose at hearing of the Chocolate Bacon Bar. You really should not knock it before you try it. Other unusual ingredients in their chocolate are curry, blood oranges and balsamic vinegar. Just to name a few!\nSince I get Vosges catalogs then OF COURSE I knew that The Forum shops in Caesar's Palace had a Vosges store. Much of the merchandise that was being sold here was what you can get in Vosges catalog. The perk here is that you can buy individual truffles without having to buy a box of them. The store seemed to offer different truffles than what I have seen before. Like a chocolate truffle made with balsamic vinegar, a vanilla truffle as well as several others.\nThe chocolate was of course delicious!

Is it a place I would want to live? No. Since I first went to Las Vegas in the early 90's I have seen this town which seemed rough around it's glamorous edges turn into a decent sized city. But with the delight of growing also comes growing pains. \nPersonally I think traffic in Las Vegas is God awful. Not only are the roads seem ill maintained and in need of being expanded but the way people drive is nothing short of inconsiderate or even cautious. Perhaps it is resident's of Las Vegas and Nevada that feel like they need to drive this way to deal with incompetent tourist drivers. Whatever the case may be I can leave it. Denver drivers don't drive like this! \nEating out I found out can be a gamble too. Some places that charge an arm an a leg only put out sub par casino food. The Strip is especially guilty of this. I did find that if you do wonder off The Strip not too far then you can find some good places. Just avoid the places that will bring in tourists. Of course there are always exceptions to the rule.\nAs Vegas has grown it has brought in many more people for at one time had a booming casino and recreation scene which made the city so big practically overnight! When the economy tanked so did the casinos and now Nevada's unemployment is worse than Michigan's!\nOf course there are pros to Vegas the amazing concerts, night shows and acts that they rake in. Shopping is no slouch either! Stores that are not seen unless you live on either coast seem common place here and are an exciting treat to us Midwesterners. Those pros in of itself earns Vegas it's four stars out me. The cons are worth it if you don't get into an accident or anything of the sort.\nVegas's glitz and glam is infectious but it wears off fast. It is like having Halloween or Christmas decorations up too long. The glitz wears a bit thin and then wears you out. The hotels are themed of places that are somewhere else and eventually become transparent after being bowled over by the showiness at first glance. Of course this is all from my own point of view and some people don't mind it all and want daily doses of glitz for the rest of their lives. More power to them!

On The Strip though the idea of 'You get what you pay for' is not necessarily true either. Some casino food is expensive or at least they charge way more than what it is worth and sometimes the food tastes sub par right down to awful. Sure there are decent to good places on The Strip but the restaurants through my experience taste significantly better and are less expensive if you leave The Strip.
