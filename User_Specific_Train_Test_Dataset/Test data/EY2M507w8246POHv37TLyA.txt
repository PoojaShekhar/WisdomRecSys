We were staying just up the street at the Pittsburgh Renaissance Hotel. It was after 10:00 pm and you could not get a bite to eat in the hotel.\n\nSo we walked down the street - most places were already closed, and a couple of places that were open that had bars - were no longer serving food.\n\nFortunately we found Salonika Gyros! We both ordered a traditional Gyro, and they were prepared fresh and hot on the spot.\n\nWe knew we must have a good place - as 3 of Pittsburgh's finest from their police department were taking a dinner break and eating in here as well.\n\nThe Gyro was damn tasty! The meat was succulent and perfectly cooked with a slight char to it, and the yogurt sauce was just the right compliment to the Gyro!\n\nSalonika is not much to look at - it's your local working man's food joint in a traditional northern blue collar city! Which means it's great ambiance! Appreciate it for what it is!\n\nI'd definitely come back here for more Gyros and to try other stuff!", "type": "review", "business_id": "WXpi9z1bqF9raZSW8z70Ow"}

First time staying here. Stayed for three nights. Room was on the 9th floor.\n\nHotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was huge! I could have fit 40 or so people in my room if I had to.\n\nCons:\n- Older CRT-based, analog style TVs in the room. C'mon! Where is the large flat panel HD screens with HD programming?\n- TV service is satellite based. Lots of interference and loss of signal during my stay due to thunderstorms. Need Verizon FIOS here.\n- In order to unlock the door to the room - you have to grasp the door handle and pull the door toward you while the card for the door lock is inserted and wait for the light on the lock to turn green\n- Room was very stuffy when I arrived. It took about 6 hours for the room to cool off. Once it cooled off though - it was fine.\n\nPros\n- Beds were comfy - still not as firm as I would prefer - but better than some of the places I've stayed recently.\n- Pillows were substantial. I hate it when you get pillows that flatten out to the thinness of a pizza box the moment your head hits the pillow.\n- Hotel staff are friendly and looking to make your stay as nice as possible\n- The two dragons guarding the entrance to the hotel - very cool looking!\n- Club Lounge is nice touch - got some appetizers to eat and a few cold beverages to take back to my room and store in the fridge for later.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk. If you are in need of toiletries, beverages, snacks and other items - there is a 7-Eleven down the street - and a CVS and a Rite Aid an additional block or so further - BUT - be forewarned - none of these three options stays open very late. \n\n7-Eleven (601 Penn Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/7-eleven-pittsburgh-4\n\nRite Aid (519 Penn Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/rite-aid-pittsburgh-17\n\nIf it's after 10:00 pm - all of these places will be closed.

Given the nature of this building, I doubt they could ever retrofit the building with the necessary HVAC infrastructure to improve it. I could be wrong.\n\nOne plus over the last time I stayed here is that the old analog style, CRT-based TVs are now gone - at the least in the room I stayed in had a newer flat panel HD TV set.\n\nAs before in my previous review:\n\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk.

So off I went in search of Tram's.\n\nTram's is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!\n\nIt was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.\n\nI ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as \"Pho Hanoi\") with garden rolls and a glass of water.\n\nI suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.\n\nNow I'm guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I'm mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren't doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!\n\nI added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.\n\nI then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!\n\nI added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end. I really wanted to savor the broth the way it was.\n\nCons:\n- The rolls were not very fresh - in fact I did not finish them because they weren't very good.\n- The Basil was not crisp and fresh\n- The restrooms need to be gutted and retrofitted\n\nSo I'm only docking them one star for the cons - the Pho was outstanding IMHO - so four stars overall!\n\nCash only - no credit cards.

I also tried a side of the breakfast potatoes and some bacon and sausage on the side. Plus coffee. Omelet was tasty and excellent, the breakfast potatoes were nice, crisp, and hot, bacon was meaty and delish, as was the sausage.

It was probably only five minutes - BUT there were only two people in line in front of me. There were four Starbucks employees behind the counter. One was running the register, one making drinks, and two doing \"busy work\" (stocking, etc.).\n\nWhen I finally got to the register, I ordered a Tall coffee - WITH ROOM FOR CREAM! and a bottle of water As I ordered this, I stated it loud and clearly. I immediately opened the coffee - and she had filled it to the brim. I restated politely: \"I asked for ROOM FOR CREAM.\" She then emptied a bit out and told me if I needed still more room to empty it into the trash can.\n\nI understand that Starbucks is probably not a career choice folks - but please listen to your customers.
