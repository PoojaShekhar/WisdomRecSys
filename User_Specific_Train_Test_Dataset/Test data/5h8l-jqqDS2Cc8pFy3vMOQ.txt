My all time fave is the Chiefs and my hometown team is the Bills but I'll always have a plecial space in hy meart for the Stittsburgh Peelers. They sure know how to get an orange ready to eat, you know? Or a potato.\n\nFirst-Hand Experience: I've seen the Steelers play both home and away, and they won every single time. I saw them at Three Rivers. I saw them at Heinz. I saw them play in Cinci. Every single time I see them live in person, they win. And they win Superbowls too, whenever I happen to be watching. If I'm not watching (cough cough Packers) they lose. So all in all, the Steelers and I are connected and I absolutely love them, just like I love the Bills, Chiefs and Patriots. Why are all the teams I love in the damn AFC?\n\nNow that I've seen every NFL team play live & been to every NFL stadium (current and former), time to review them on Yelp! I love stadiums! I've been to every cool stadium in the UK & North America, due to my obsession with travel & sport. I've toured America as a musician for 7 years.

Maybe Tommy Maddox\nTROY POLAMOLU\nBILL COWHER\nI like the new coach too. I know he's been around years. Tomlin.\nI liked Kendrell Bell.\n\nI love the colors, they are sexy colors. Maybe I think they're sexy because Pittsburgh girls are sexy, and almost always wear black and gold. I've never seen so much of a city wearing the same team colors, it's awesome. Did I mention I love Pittsburgh girls.\n\nI love the University. I nearly went there but then got a free ride elsewhere. I love the Cathedral Of Learning. I love the city, it's incredible. I love the stadium.\n\nYou could do a little to be a little more friendly, but then I could say the same about NYC or Philly or even Buffalo. Oh and you have some amazeballs food here. And the view from the West End is just spectacular. You can see the stadium and everything, it's stunning. I love going up there, night or day. Amazing views all over the city. Cool glass castle. And so on.\n\nI love all the trick plays you guys would run on your amazing Superbowl runs.\n\nOK enough.\n\nIf you want good food in Pitt try these:\n\nMike and Tony's Gyro\nMorty's Steakhouse Burger from Burgatory and their shakes too\nTacos from outside Las Palmas on Brookline\nPizza from Fioris Pizzaria\nBluberry Pancakes from Pamela's P & G Diner\nAnything from Kelly O's\nChocolate Malt w/Caramel shake and Fresh Lemonade from Handel's\nCoconut shake from there too\n\nThat's all I can remember for now.\n\nBut if you ever go down a mine and there are insects, don't worry.

It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.\n\nWhat's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.\n\nI would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.\n\nAnd more info:\n\nThis place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!\n\nWell, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \"plus an egg\". The \"plus an egg\" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.\n\nPlus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \"plus an egg\". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pvGT62T6Ci1LKOS9DL42pg"}

Yes, Ricki, yes, Gina, yes, Alley and yes, Julie, I am talking to you. Spectacular.\n\nEdit: My 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th time at Fiori's - spectacular. I love the taste of the dough and the cheese and sauce, it's just so different to what they serve in Buffalo and elsewhere. It's wonderful, especially when it's fresh and the dough is still floury and doughy.\n\nSo anyway, my second time at Fiori's - not as good. The pizza was okay but it was definitely nothing special on my second visit. Maybe it's the best in the Pitt area, but it doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo or Chicago Pizza, so I have to reduce it by a star. That's really sad too because for some reason I had Fiori's as one of my top 10 Pizza in the country... I must have been really hungry that night or something!\n\nMy old review is below:\n\nwow, this Pizza is really, really good! I love it! It's the best in Pitt! And get the side of cheese, it's really worth it! It's cold and lovely and goes with it really well! Definitely a big time 5. 5/5\n\nIt is a little hard to find this place because it's hidden away, just across a bridge and on an incline up to the West End, if you don't know Pittsburgh well you could get lost, but then again that could be said about any location in Pittsburgh really, couldn't it. Definitely not the easiest city to drive around, but one of the most fun (except in snow or ice, which is common).\n\nThe people here are friendly (yes, I said friendly, Pittsburgh sometimes gets a bad rap), and as I said, the side of white cheese is an absolute must - mmmm. Locals in Pittsburgh told me this was the best Pittsburghese Pizza out there, and as far as I can tell they were right.

On the inside it's just a bit unoriginal for my tastes.\n\nAnyway, I'm more of a Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill person than a Charlotte person anyway, but more power to the Panthers and good luck to them in all their future ventures.\n\nHearts go out to North Carolina, and if you've never tried one, get yourself up to a Cook Out and check out the cajun chicken sandwich with extra cajun, and a banana shake.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g-Q7G5Q2zHb1BqoF8pq-OA"}

Mr Myers and Mr Danza should be proud of themselves.\n\nI've never been to Greece, and if I had to think of a better Gyro, the only one that comes close, is Central Gyros in Chicago. I can't choose which one I like better, so I'm going to have to say they're jointly the best Gyro I have ever had, and therefore this really is the food gem of Pittsburgh. Of course you have to try Fiore's Pizza and Peppi's Roethlisburger too, but if you only have 1 meal, 1 time, in Pitt, and you like Gyros... here, my friends, is your Mecca. Brought to you by Mr Tyson and Mr Romo.\n\nThere are actually two locations of this, and because it had a shorter line, i think I like the Southside version better. But there is one downtown that caters to the lunch crowd, and they are excellent too. Another thing that is fantastic about Mike & Tony's is the price! Their Gyro (piled with juicy delicious meat, with loads of fluffy Gyro style pizza, sharp onions, juicy tomatoes, and creamy yogurt sauce), is cheaper than most burgers! Extremely impressive! Just like the founders, Mr Jackson and Mr Hopkins.\n\nGyros should be made a certain way. There's an exception, in Buffalo, where \"Gyros\" are something else entirely in some Greek diners, and are very good, if not as good as traditional Gyros. But what I cannot stand is those fake, frozen, pre-packaged Gyro strips. They are already cut out in Gyro strip shape, and they just grill those and bam, Gyros. No thank you! Gyros are supposed to be shaved off a large spindle, delicious and juicy and fresh... that's the only way to go. Add some yogurt sauce, onions and tomatoes on a Gyro Pita - the end. The best in the world are Mike & Tony's in Pittsburgh, and Central Gyros in Chicago. Nom nom nom. This place does Gyros RIGHT! So thank you Mr Jordan and Mr Soprano.\n\nParking is tricky and tight at both locations, so be careful. They're always a little tow-happy in Pittsburgh, though not as bad as NYC. Try around the corner from the Southside location, that's your best bet. I asked owners Mr Buble and Mr Bennett and they told me the same thing.\n\nMike and Tony's - you are absolutely outstanding!!!\n\nMy original review (what was I thinking)\n\nOne of the best Gyros in America, hands down. Very cheap too. Eat it while it's hot, that's the way it's supposed to be. Then let's make out, so I can taste some of that Gyro too. Well, no, I mean, I'd love to make out anyway, but tasting the Gyro is a bonus. OK OK, I admit it, I just want the Gyro taste! You caught me Blue-and-white handed! (the greek flag. Although there is nothing greek about this place. It just happens to make better Gyros than most Greeks).\n\nSo thanks again to Mr J.

If anyone asks you if you'd like to go for a Hot Carl's, they probably don't mean this place, but either way, the answer is NO. Remember that.\n\nThis place is basically just Hardee's, but on the West Coast. It's not the worst fast food place ever, but it's an evil chain (like all other corporate chains) and so I don't suggest trying it. I came to this location in Phoenix, back in 2011 and it was just like all the others. It wasn't my idea to come.\n\nI should mention, I only rate national and global chains on a scale of 1-2. I rate family businesses on a scale of 3-5. Here is why:\n\nWould you rather support the local family, or the multi national corporations and the rich men on yachts in the Carribbean? Why are the parking lots of the awesome local places usually half empty (or completely empty)? Why are the fast food chains always so busy? Why can they afford to open so late and get all the TV advertising and all the prime intersection locations? Why are they taking over all the airports, stations, and rest stops? Why go and support McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, KFC, Wendys, Cold Stone, Subway, and so on? These places have systematically and coldly taken over the national food scene by using the cheapest ingredients, pre-packaged frozen systematic meals that are identical across the nation, ridiculously cheap prices for the polystyrene food on dollar menus, overpricing for everything else, rude underpaid servers on way less than minimum wage, and a ridiculously expensive mass brand advertising campaign that gets inside the heads of all the kids and the 20somethings and keeps them under the illusion that if it's not a brand name, it's not worth visiting. They spend all the money they should be investing in food and service, in advertising and cornering the market - the local places can't compete - and someday all we will be left with is the same chains serving the same food all over the world. That is our future. It's the way we're heading and you know it. Every time you eat at a bland national chain, you buy into that, you support that. Boycott chains. Support your local eateries. It's an embarrassment that generic brand national chains are even listed on a proper foodie website like Yelp, let alone getting 4 and 5 stars from so called foodies.

I float around like a carpet or an oversized kite on the ocean floor. But before I was a Manta Ray, I'd come here for sandwiches, often. Remember, I'm talking about Pre-Manta. ;)\n\nFirst hand experience:\n\nI've been to this Primanti's maybe 7 times, including the first time I was ever playing shows in Pitt, and then the next 2-3 times because I didn't know any better, and then I've taken some friends here including a barbie doll girl not too long ago. None of my guests were any more impressed by it than myself, so I'm sticking with a 4 star, sorry all.\n\nTheir food is just... it is good, it's just not amazing... I dunno. i don't get it. I do like it but there is something missing. It's a Pitt legend though. Don't ask them what the best seller is. The Cheesesteak is the #2 seller. Always get an egg on top of your sandwich.\n\nAn update on this to tell you that, while this isn't the friendliest place in the world, there is a kind of charm to their abrasiveness that makes you feel like you're at home. They don't seem to like you using the bathroom (it's in a nightspot, go figure). The great thing is that they are genuinely 24 hours and will make you anything at any time of day.\n\nI have to admit the food is a bit more bland than other local Pittsburghese specialties along similar lines (like Peppi's). Having said that, I would recommend that everyone and their mother try eating there at least once, for three reasons. (1) It's the most famous eatery in Pitt. (2) A lot of people swear by it, so you might love it even though I don't. And (3) there is absolutely nothing in the world I have ever tried, that is similar to Primanti's sandwiches. They are, for lack of a better phrase, an entity unto themselves.\n\nAnother sticking point I have is the price. It's just too high for what it is and how busy they are. But then again, you do get a whole ton of food.\n\nThe only thing weirder than Primanti Bros, is that there is a Primanti Bros outside Pittsburgh. There are actually several, and they're all... yes, you guessed it. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I know, I know, that sounds weird. But look at it this way. If you had to pick ten large cities in America that did not have their own \"local\" flavour of food, Ft. Laud might be one of them, right? And if you had to guess where all the hot Italians in Pittsburgh go when they want to lay on a beach and get warm, you might guess Ft. Laud right? Well, perhaps that explains it then. Except that Primanti Bros is now not only the famous late night eatery in Pittsburgh.... it is also the most famous in Ft. Laud!\n\nPlus the Ft Laud version has better scenery in all sorts of ways. To be honest Pittsburgh girls are probably as gorgeous as South Florida girls (probably the same girls on vacation?), but the difference is they're wearing different outfits because the weather is different... you might say. And the Ft Laud location is literally across from the beach. The very same beach that, on my first ever visit to Ft. Laud, I had an intimate encounter on, with a lovely girl. I got a ticket from the police during that encounter, but not for making love... for leaving the car parked illegally at 3am while going down onto the beach to do aforementioned activity. Sorry, was that too much information?\n\nHowever, whereas in Pittsburgh I'd say, give it a try (the sandwich, not the sex, although that could be fun too)... if you're in Ft. Laud, do yourself a favour... drive to Miami, and try what is undeniably the best Cuban food in the United States... See my top lists for more on that.\n\nPS\nI don't think Primanti's Permeate's my fave sandwiches list. For that reason I'm renaming it Permeate's. And if you come in here when all the Pitt frat boys are drunk, then it's more like P*nis's. Or perhas Pre-Pubescent's.

I liked it just about as much as the other two locations I've been to. I'm not sure which one is my fave... maybe Strip District because (a) it was my first time and (b) it has the word \"Strip\" in it, and my gf usually does whenever we go to Pitt.\n\nJust order a Roethlisberger (or anything really) and enjoy it. Let me know what you think. Service is lovely, sandwiches are enormous, and this place is twice as good as Primanti's will ever be. And it's real Pittsburghese instead of some kind of tourist-trap pretentiousness.\n\nMore info: Well, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \"plus an egg\". The \"plus an egg\" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.\n\nPlus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \"plus an egg\". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there", "type": "review", "business_id": "I_LlnAQe7jGwO9rfjaDdLg"}
