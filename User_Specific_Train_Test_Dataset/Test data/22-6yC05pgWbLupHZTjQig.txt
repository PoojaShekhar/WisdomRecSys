I ended up here because with a group on 5, it was not easy to get a reservation on a busy Saturday night. This restaurant seems to catered to large groups with communal tables and family style menu, which seems to be well suited our party of five.\n\nService was attentive and excellent. I wish the food can match the service. \n\nWe shared: \n\nOysters ($15) - Apple ice cider vinegar from Vergers de la Colline\n- Not bad, I had better oysters..\n\nChef Choice Seared Foie Gras ($23)\n- The best part of the meal... I would just come back to have that\n- Love how the sourness of the fresh grapes compliment the fattiness of the foie gras\n- No sharing! All mine!\n\nThe Whole Hog ($32/pp) - Baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, braised shanks, braising juices and parmesan cheese French fries \n- The platter looked amazing for photos but most of the meat tasted bland and dry\n- The only thing I enjoyed was the shank which was tender and moist\n- I did enjoy the roasted vegetables... \n\nThe only saving grace might be some local beers in bottles... Dieu du Ciel did make the dining experience a little more enjoyable.\n\nSadly I doubt I will be coming back again really soon...... unless I can have that foie gras all for myself!", "type": "review", "business_id": "LQsZ3UJPUcKLDQJaI0T69w"}
