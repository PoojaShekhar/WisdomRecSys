The worst hotel experience in Vegas that I have done. Way on the other side of the strip, hotel rooms are like \"no tell, motels.\" Annoying frat boys throughout the night with shitty costumer service was the pits. I went on the strip so often just to avoid hanging out in my room. This was in the scummy part of the strip which added to the experience in a negative way. It's one of those hotels which looks great in pictures...not so much in real life. There were hidden fees when booking compared to other hotels which angered me to no extent.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WT-v-DgQvW38DewVyTLdTA"}

They have a huge wall of every color of M&M's with shades in between for any theme of occasion. Personally I am more interested in the M&M merchandise than I am in the candy itself as it usually melts within 5 minutes of walking down the strip, therefore, outside the novelty it's only good for immediate consumption.
