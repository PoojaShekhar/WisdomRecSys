It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.\n\nOur reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.\n\nPostino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.\n\nGranted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.\n\nWe took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

We had an hour to kill before heading to the airport on the Sunday of our trip, and found ourselves close enough to Four Peaks Grill & Tap that we decided to check it out.\n\nI wasn't in love with the place. It was a sports bar in a giant ugly strip mall next to a Party City. There were a lot of people there to watch football on a Sunday afternoon, so it was a bit loud, and otherwise pretty bland. We sat on an enclosed patio next to a draped tarp that dripped water. Service was good, though, and we did enjoy ourselves.\n\nWe had a round of beers and an order of Bavarian pretzels, a solid mid-afternoon snack. We had the Hop Knot IPA and the 8th Street Pale Ale, and I remember liking one and not the other, but not which was which. (Feel free to mash the Useful button right there.) The pretzels were great--big, soft, and chewy, studded with salt. They came with a spicy mustard sauce and an optional chile cheese dip. Don't skip on that cheese--it was delicious.\n\nI didn't like this place enough to come back on another vacation, but the beer and pretzels were tasty, and our time was better spent here than it would've been at the airport. I wouldn't recommend this bar unless you're a local or a major sports fan on a game day, but I'll definitely keep drinking Four Peaks beer when I'm in Phoenix.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LzNJLEIo4gh-X_rmDkNkNg"}

Apparently that rare strip club is The Olympic Garden.*\n\nMy friends and I came to The OG on the first night of my bachelorette weekend in Vegas, along with many other like-minded bachelorettes.  They kept me in the dark about where we were going, so when the limo arrived, I just hopped in and enjoyed the ride.  The limo was a great touch, included with The OG package.  We were like eight girls on prom night, going to meet our (super hot) dates.\n\nWhen we arrived at our destination, I took in the signage and quickly figured out we were at a strip club.  This was not entirely unexpected, but I laughed and squealed with some measure of drunken excitement.  I'd never been to a strip club before.  We paid cover, with my girls getting mine, then got escorted past the first floor of female strippers to a stairway, where the man helping us asked if we wanted to pay an extra $40 or so for a table with a handle of vodka.  We said yes.\n\nWe had pre-gamed a bit, but when we sat at our table, we knew, collectively, that we hadn't drank enough.  We gawked at the men writhing on stage, and at the mortifying lap dances happening all around us.  When the strippers started swarming our table, we turned them away, waiting instead for the delivery of our drinks.  The vodka was a long time coming - too long, really - but when it finally arrived, we went right to work.  We got quite a lot of it, with two mixers (juice and soda, I think, but I can't be sure).  At one point, my friend went and bought water, which cost $10 for a tiny bottle.  That's (one of the many ways) how they get you, I guess.\n\nWe got loaded, and after that, the night was a complete blast.  We stayed for three or four hours and had an amazing time.  The strippers were gorgeous, built like statues, gleaming with pheromones.  Several of them had faces to match, which almost seemed unnecessary.  They performed on a stage that went through the center of the room, generally one at a time (alas, no group dance routines), and they were excellent dancers.  One in particular caught our eye, as well as the heart of one of my bridesmaids.  His name was Tyson, and my friends bought me a lap dance on stage.  It was kind of embarrassing, but I was busted up drunk.  Thankfully, Tyson didn't put my hand on his junk, as some of the strippers did to girls here and there.  I think the men are decent at gaging comfort levels, and I was not giving off touchy vibes.  Still, there are some very incriminating pictures on way too many cell phones.  I think part of the fun of these lap dances is that the strippers put you in compromising poses.  There isn't too much actual contact, but the lap dances are fun to watch.\n\nWhich I know because almost everyone in my group got one at one point or another.  I bought one on stage for my maid of honor, from Carlos, another lovely man (who was also, by all reports, incredibly sweet).  It cost $40 - certainly worth four small bottles of Evian.  The dances on the floor cost $20, and by the end of the night, we were all buying them for each other, taking turns getting grinded on and hooting and snapping pictures.  I didn't get all the dancers' names, but I know one of my friends had Jimmy, who was almost butt naked, and one of them had a good-looking black man in glasses.  She was smitten with this stripper, so much so that when we got back to our hotel, we called The OG to at least learn his name - we just wanted to know what to call the love of her life.  We were denied.\n\nWe had so much fun here that we almost went back the second night of my bachelorette.  If I hadn't gotten pukey, I think we might have ended up back at The OG.\n\nAt some point, I figured out that The OG stood for The Olympic Garden, and I thought, as I'm sure most Angelenos have, \"That sure sounds like a Korean restaurant.\"  I may never be a bachelorette again, but my friends and I are thoroughly enamored of this club.  We'll be back for another round of all you can eat beefcake before the next one gets a ring.\n\n*I will note that the club in Magic Mike is remarkably white, but what do you expect from Hollywood?  Diversity that reflects the actual demographics of the depicted population?  Haha, oh you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YZxA6w82eFJFntwqJLln6w"}

It was a brutal couple of days.  When I arrived in Phoenix with a couple hours to kill, I decided to spend them with my dog, a book, and some wine, to unwind from the long drive.\n\nI walked into Grazie late on a Monday afternoon and stayed for about two hours.  The place was more or less empty, and I got a nice table on the patio all to myself.  It was a very hot day, and the patio wasn't quite comfortable, but it was as well covered and cool as it could be.  I drank two glasses of white wine from the extensive menu.  Both were quite good, and suited to the weather.\n\nIt was a mostly pleasant afternoon, but a couple things turned me off to Grazie.  One, while I was clearly not allowed inside with my dog (never expected, of course), the owner or someone on staff had two dogs inside the restaurant, roaming around.  At one point, the dogs came out, checked out my dog, and then one of them peed on the concrete wall right next my table, a foot away from where I was sitting.  Come on...I love dogs, but that's just gross.  Two, my second glass of wine came with a small surprise - I took one sip and pulled a dead bug from my tongue.  I pointed this out to my waiter, who did, to be fair, offer to replace the glass.  I thought it would be a shame to throw out the wine and I didn't mind drinking it, but I also kind of figured I might get that glass free, or get another glass thrown in.  I guess when I said I didn't want the wine to go to waste, the waiter decided that was that.\n\nThat said, the waiter was perfectly nice, and I had a good time drinking at Grazie.  I left with a light buzz, which was great for that time of day.  If I lived in town the dogs and the bug might still deter me from coming back, but I can't say I didn't enjoy my visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "k6Si433-EJrY4J7SZxsnjA"}

It was a charming little restaurant, with the feel of a rich old white lady's house--greenery and white picket fences outside, white furniture, white tablecloths, and gingham prints inside. The vibe was calm and relaxing in an upscale kind of way--like this would be a great place for a fancy tea party. I had a glass of red sangria with my lunch, and that felt right, too.\n\nThe food was excellent--fresh, clean, farm-to-table kind of fare. We ordered some warm brie with caramelized apples to share, and this was a wonderful appetizer, the cheese baked soft and gooey, the apples the perfect sweetness, all served with crusty toasted baguette. I got the roasted salmon \"super\" salad for my lunch, and it was perfectly executed. The salmon was ideally moist and flaky, and it came over a bed of farro, kale, radicchio, red onion, chickpeas, and cherry tomato, with a tarragon dressing. I loved all the textures, and every element was inherently flavorful. I very rarely order salads for meals, but this was one I'd get again and again. My husband got a modified ham and cheese sandwich (the kitchen graciously made it more kid-friendly for my 32-year-old boy) with the potato salad on the side, which I ate with enthusiasm. It was a phenomenally good potato salad, with firm, fingerling potatoes in a flavorful dill dressing.\n\nArcadia Farms is across the street from the Poisoned Pen bookstore, which is my destination whenever I come to Phoenix. I'm happy to have a go-to place for lunch in the area, and look forward to my next Arcadia Farms meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "24V8QQWO6VaVggHdxjQQ_A"}

Last year, I decided to save money and use Couchsurfing. It wasn't a bad experience, but I didn't get a bed (or even a couch, actually--I slept in an armchair). I also drove from L.A. to Phoenix and back in two days, blowing a flat on my way back about ten miles outside of Indio. This time, my husband and I decided to take a weekend trip, and booked a room at The Phoenician. Probably goes without saying, but this trip was more enjoyable than the first. The Phoenician must be one of the nicest hotels in town.\n\nWe used Starwood points to book our room (The Phoenician is in the Luxury Collection) and thought this hotel offered excellent value. We stayed two nights in a beautiful room with a comfortable bed and an attractive bathroom. We hung by the pool, drank at the hotel bar, and had an all-around lovely resort experience.\n\nThe pool was nice, nothing elaborate but very pretty, and I was impressed with the food and service we got from the comfort of our lounge chairs. I had a salad with spice-encrusted ahi tuna, watermelon, jicama, navel orange, cucumber, and baby field greens in a sweet chili vinaigrette--like a legitimate quality restaurant salad. My husband's cheeseburger was also tasty.\n\nWe also had good drinking, both at the pool and the bar, where we were able to use drink tickets that came complimentary with our Starwood reservation. We had Four Peaks pale ale and a solid Bloody Mary at the pool, and nice cocktails inside. I enjoyed a Prickly-Pe\u00f1o Margarita with tequila, lime juice, Cointreau, orange juice, and a jalape\u00f1o-prickly pear syrup. The Single-Barrel Mojito and the Lychee-Jito were also great.\n\nParking was free and easy, and service was pleasant all around. I only wish we'd had more time to hang out.

We figured out there was a Nordstrom near our hotel and went first thing Saturday morning (10:30AM) so we could spend some time by the pool.\n\nIf you've been to a Nordstrom built in the last ten years, you've been to this Nordstrom. Nice, spacious, with high-end gear all around. Basically the same layout as the Nordstroms in L.A. The selection of men's swimwear was slimmer than I would've expected in such a hot town, but Matt was able to find a handsome pair of RVCA trunks that wasn't unduly expensive. No line or hassle at either fitting room or register.\n\nAs long as we were there, I wanted to pick up a few make-up items I'd been meaning to buy over the past month. I sidled up to the NARS counter, where I wanted to get a lipstick that was sold out the last time I was in a Nordstrom and a Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base. (Make-up tip from someone with few to offer--this primer is the only thing I've tried that prevents mascara from smudging under my eyes.) I was helped by a sales associate named Christine, who was very friendly and helpful. Nordstrom was having some kind of pre-sale that would get me a big-ass gift set if I spent like $75 or $80 (I forget the amount, but I was almost there with the two things I was already getting). I added a lipliner to my purchase and had her ship my order when the sale went into effect. Ended up spending more than I'd planned, but not by much, and the gift set was pretty legit, with a nice zip make-up bag and probably $30 worth of products. Everything arrived as promised, with a hand-written card and phone call from Christine.\n\nI realize this whole thing makes me sound like a sucker, but I was pleased with my haul and Christine was perfectly lovely. There was no high-pressure upsell, and I got more than I paid for. Matt did well with his swim trunks, and I've already used all three of my purchases.

The Poisoned Pen has a whole wall of shelves devoted to signed first editions.  As you might expect, older first editions go for more than cover price, but the new ones are not marked up, as far as I could tell.  It's a testament to the draw of the Poisoned Pen that so many authors come by and leave their traces behind.\n\nThe people behind the Poisoned Pen are very dedicated - there's even a Poisoned Pen Press, with a whole wall of the bookstore devoted to those releases.

Not all of the authors are big names, but many are.\n\nI don't live in Phoenix, but my fiance and I stopped by with our dog on our way home from Sedona.  It was a great stop.  I spent a long time scanning the titles, and left with novels by Denise Mina and Tana French.  While we were there, the bookstore was setting up for one of its many readings, and the author's books were prominently displayed for anyone interested.

The Poisoned Pen is a sort of hub of the mystery community, and as such, it hosts some insane number of readings per year.  When I was planning my tour, I told my publicist I only wanted to go places where I knew people and had places to stay - this surprises some people, but publishers do not foot the bill for book tours.  He asked if I'd make one exception, for The Poisoned Pen, because of the store's particular friendliness and prominence.\n\nSo on June 3, I loaded the dog in my car and made the six hour drive from L.A. to Phoenix.  I booked free accommodations through couchsurfing.org and had myself a little adventure.  Until it was time for my reading, I had this deep fear that no one would show up, and that the reading would be canceled due to lack of interest.  I told myself that if that were to happen, the staff would probably feel so sorry for me that they'd promote my book after the fact.  I was preparing myself for the worst.\n\nI was really thankful when I walked in, fortified with some wine, and found a small circle of readers seated and ready to talk about my book.  Coincidentally, Pat, who I met on my first visit to The Poisoned Pen, was hosting my event.  I thought I would be reading, but instead, Pat led me through a Q & A that revealed a lot more about my book than any single passage.  He had read my book beforehand and asked really smart, revelatory questions.  It was a lot of fun, and it took a lot of pressure off me.  I also got to interact with everyone there, and I ended up meeting some cool readers.  Once we wrapped up the Q & A, I signed books, both for the people attending and for collectors who'd ordered signed copies from outside the state.  The Poisoned Pen has to be one of the top purveyors of collectible mysteries, and I guess it has customers who buy every debut in the hopes that the authors become big names later.  Hope I strike it big for you all.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the brag brag brag, but I wanted to thank The Poisoned Pen for hosting me.  I was really scared going in, and ended up having a marvelous time.  On my way out, I bought an Ian Rankin novel and got a 35% discount - the most generous author discount I have yet to come across.  I have a sequel in the pipeline due out next summer, and I hope to come back to The Poisoned Pen.

Stef and I shared the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy, while Matt had the Margherita.

The Wiseguy was probably my favorite, a white pie loaded with wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. That sausage was so savory, that onion so subtly sweet. The Sonny Boy was also a winner, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and olives, meaty and full of flavor. I stole a bit of Matt's Margherita, and it was a top notch version of the classic pie, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.\n\nNow that I know Pizzeria Bianco comes with no hassle, I'll stop by whenever I come through Phoenix.

We circled back and ordered food and cocktails at the bar, then seated ourselves at a communal table.\n\nService, at least, was excellent. Our bartender, a young dude with blondish hair, acted as our waiter, too--wish I'd gotten his name, because he was helpful and friendly and generally wonderful. He ordered our food for us and brought it out, along with our drinks. He also made fantastic cocktails. I got my Bloody Mary and it was totally worth the journey. I have no idea what went into it, but it was spicy and flavorful, with depth and complexity, an umami bomb of a Bloody Mary in a mason jar with salt-frosted rim. Didn't hurt that it came garnished with pickled asparagus, green bean, and carrot, along with jalape\u00f1o slices and a fistful of candied bacon--out of control delicious. There was no cocktail menu, but our bartender asked what my husband was in the mood for, and fixed him a beautiful, balanced Aviation--a lavender-colored cocktail with gin, creme de violette, maraschino liqueur, and lemon juice, garnished with a fancy cocktail cherry.\n\nThe food was less exciting, but serviceable enough. I had Aunt Ida's Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits were buttery with a nice crumble, and I liked the hearty sausage gravy. My husband got some toast with butter and jam, and supplemented that with a croissant. He wasn't particularly impressed with any of it.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend Lux Central for its food, but it's a cool coffee shop with a knockout bar. I'd love to come back for another round of drinks next time I'm in Phoenix. I just wouldn't show up looking for a sit-down meal on an empty stomach.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aRkYtXfmEKYG-eTDf_qUsw"}

I'm not a bread person at all, and I tend to ignore the rolls that restaurants usually put out with meals, but I would go back to Mesa just for the bread.  There was an herb and asiago and a corn and chile muffin that were just incredible.  The herb and asiago was subtle but not overly so, with just the right amount of cheesiness, and the corn muffin - oh my goodness.  First of all, beautiful - the color of the chiles comes through in a red swirl that makes an appetizing contrast with the dark gold of the muffin.  Texture is spot on - soft and warm and crumbly but not dry, and when you bite into it you find whole kernels of corn tucked inside that really add a little extra.  And of course, it tastes wonderful.  The chiles really give it the perfect kick - I cannot imagine a better corn muffin.  Needless to say, but my friend and I polished off our bread basket in no time and the thoughtful waiter noticed us picking at crumbs and brought us a second.\n\nUh...so I just spent a significant fraction of my life talking about the BREAD at this place.  It was just so impressive, and I had high expectations for the rest of the meal.  Amazingly, they were not disappointed!  After devouring the second bread basket sans mercy, we ordered a ceviche sampler to start.  The sampler was very pretty, with four square plates each holding spoons topped with tiny tiny tiny little mounds of various ceviches.  Each ceviche had a different flavor to it, and they were all quite good, and we managed to share through some surgical utensil usage.  This was probably the least memorable course, if only because there just wasn't enough tasting to get acquainted, but still superb.\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the pan-seared halibut and my friend ordered the chile relleno.  I think I had the better entree, but both were fantastic.  The chile was a thing of beauty, huge and crusted in cornmeal, sitting on a little pool of colorful sauces.  I tried a few bites and it was goooood.  My halibut was heavenly.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was incredible!  The flavor was really deep and rich, almost like a zesty barbecue, and it worked magically with the mild fish.  Sweet red onions were also a nice touch.\n\nThis being our last night in Vegas, we weren't about to skip dessert, and we ordered a fresh berry tart with strawberry creme fraiche ice cream and an empanada with peach, mango, and cream cheese filling with a white peach tequila sorbet.  (Seriously, how do you see that described on the menu and not order it?)  Both were exceptional.  The tart was one of the best fruit tarts I've ever had.  It came on a gorgeous puff pastry that was perfect with the fruit and the custard filling.  The strawberry creme fraiche ice cream was light and delicious.  The empanada was like nothing else I've ever eaten, and all those components actually work together like a dream.\n\nAnd yeah, the place is pretty.  I especially appreciate the colorful decor because of how well it reflects the beautiful colors in the food.  Service is also fabulous.  Pricing - it's expensive, but not overly so.  I'd say the value is great.  And it's Vegas!  I would much rather drop $70 on a meal like this than on a few bad blackjack hands.  To wrap up a rather lengthy and worshipful review - I would go back to Mesa faster than you can say corn muffin.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

The service is fairly formal but friendly.  Dinner at Bouchon is a casual affair but rich with a vibrant Vegas feel and some excellent food.\n\nMy dinner at Bouchon was with my family of five, and we indulged in a manner befitting a meal in Sin City.  We started by ripping into the epic epi bread placed directly on our table along with good butter and a little jar of mustard.  The bread looked like a well-sprouted branch, and the little yeasted knobs that came off of it were delicious with a satisfying crust.\n\nWe ordered an array of appetizers and passed them around like a good Asian family.  The table favorite was the salmon rillettes, which were presented in a sealed mason jar opened at our table.  The rillettes were superb, with plenty of salmon character along with lots of fat and moisture.  We spread them on crunchy baguettes.  We also got the small assortment of shellfish, which came with a few varieties of oysters along with shrimp and lobster.  Everything was great - the oysters were fresh and briny, the shrimp sweet and snappy, and the lobster plump and meaty.  The assortment came with cocktail sauce, dijonnaise, and a shallot sauce, all of which were put to good use.  For something green, we ordered an heirloom tomato salad with pesto.  This was simple and lovely with bright, refreshing flavors and some gorgeous tomatoes.  The only appetizer I didn't especially care for was the escargot.  I don't mind eating snails, but these snails were a little bit boring.  They were served with little puff pastries and garlic butter, but somehow the result was unexciting.\n\nThe main courses were on the whole less impressive than the appetizers, but they were still very solid.  I ordered the braised beef short ribs special, which came with sweet carrots, potato confit, roasted bone marrow, and sauce bordelaise.  The beef was very good, tender and tasty, and I loved the softened carrots as well.  The bone marrow was fantastic smeared on everything, adding smooth velvet to each bite.  The sauce, though, was kind of overwhelming, deep but rather sweet.  The steak frites was a great, simple dish.  My brother ordered his steak medium and it was a nice even pink, with plenty of juice, and garlic butter on top.  The fries were spectacular, thin cut and crispy on the outside.  My other brother's croque madame and mom's mussels also came with these fries.  The croque madame was delicious but very decadent and hard to eat more than a couple bites of.  This was a fried egg and ham and cheese on toasted brioche, and would have been just right but for a smothering dose of mornay sauce.  The fried egg was a thing of beauty.  The mussels were the only item that I actively disliked.  The broth was fine but the mussels themselves tasted like that overwhelming garbage-like smell that mussels can sometimes have.  My dad's roasted chicken was a high point.  It was moist and juicy, served with caramelized figs, chanterelle mushrooms, pickled ramps, and chicken jus.\n\nFor dessert we split the vanilla creme brulee and the \"bouchon,\" which was three little brownies with coconut sorbet, butter pecan, and peanut butter chip ice cream.  The creme brulee was decent, though fairly standard, with a pleasant crackly sugar crust.  The \"bouchon\" was also straightforward but had a lot more sparkle.  The brownies were delicious, with a little bit of crumble but nice dark chocolate density.  The accompanying sorbet and ice creams were also great.\n\nWhen the meal was over, we were stuffed, with plenty of good food as well as a nice bottle of wine in our systems.  Overall I would say that I wasn't blown away by Bouchon, but I enjoyed our meal and might go back again.  The food wasn't fancy or innovative especially given the price point, but almost everything was precisely executed.  There's a Bouchon where I live and if I'm craving a classic bistro meal, I'll probably check it out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

I was starving, having walked down the strip for something like half an hour (I swear, everything in Vegas is deceptively far away) then waited in line for another half hour.  I was so damn hungry that I filled a plate with lox and ripped into it while I waited in line at the next station.

We stayed two nights, and with a little discreet crowding, the total came out to $83 per person, all told.  We had a pleasant, comfortable stay.\n\nLet me start by saying what the Signature is not - it is not a grandiose Vegas hotel.  It's an outpost of the MGM, and it has no casino and no flashy lights, and the pool is modest.  The place is more like a business hotel than anything else, and our suite was lovely, but thin on decor and without too much in the way of overt luxury.  This is not a complaint at all - just be warned that if you want the full glitzy experience, you might want to check elsewhere.\n\nOur suite was great.  The bigger room consisted of a bedroom, a living room, and one and a half bathrooms, and the smaller room combined bedroom and living, with only one bathroom.  I was lucky enough to share the bedroom in the bigger suite, and the bed was among the most comfortable I've ever slept in.  Of course, I also had the most refreshing Sprite I've ever sipped on from a vending machine outside the Cosmopolitan, so take that as you will.\n\nThe bathrooms were very pretty and spacious.  The shower in the master bathroom had the perfect water pressure, and we took advantage of the hot bath to soak sore feet.  The suite even had a kitchenette and a fridge and a cooktop and a microwave and all the utensils and dishes we needed.  My only complaint about the space is that it was set up as two separate rooms with two separate doors, and the only way to make the suite connect was by opening both of those doors and closing a larger one that led to both rooms.  This necessarily partitioned our group more than I would have wanted.\n\nI guess a shorter, cuter walk to the MGM would have been nice.  There are some corridors that would make you swear you were in an airport terminal, complete with a man tending a lonely outpost of a wheelie bar.  Otherwise, no problems.  Wireless was free and very much appreciated.  We also got free valet parking.  Our stay went smoothly, and service at all junctures was notably friendly.

I was expecting a McDonald's-style drive-thru speaker system, but an employee came out and took our order while we waited in our cars.  The same employee then took our money at the pay window and maybe even gave us our food at the food window?  Is that too Looney Tunes?  Maybe there was another employee or just the one window.  Either way, he was a nice guy.\n\nI ordered the combo lunch with a sandwich, a side, and a small drink.  I chose the turkey club, which was a pretty decent sandwich with smoked turkey, bacon, cheese, avocado, tomato, and lite honey mustard spread, served on toasted whole wheat.  It was a decently sized sandwich, not heavy but filling.  It was maybe a little dry despite having good turkey - less bread, maybe, or more mayonnaise would have done the trick.  I picked a soup for my side, a red pepper bisque that came with bagel chips.  This was excellent.  The soup was soothing and thick with tomato and red pepper, and the crispy bagel chips were perfect for dipping.  I'd definitely recommend a soup if you're coming through D'lish.  For my drink, I subbed in the Breakfast Buzz for a little bit extra.  I wasn't quite sold when I read the description on the menu, but as I often do, I let the voice of Yelp dictate my order.

The cute cheesy setting with its fake sky and numerous indoor street performers was entertaining, and I don't believe I've ever met a Mario Batali joint I didn't love.\n\nI came for a leisurely lunch with my family and a few family friends, and we sat on the pseudo-patio.  Men in full make-up and stilts traipsed by, and tourists looked on amused.  For our direct appreciation, Enoteca San Marco provided paper placemats that taught us how to pick up a stranger at a Vegas club and make obscene hand signs, both in Italian.  Service was accordingly casual and friendly.\n\nWe were provided with breadsticks and a spongey herb focaccia when we sat down.  Our table then shared the caprese with burrata as well as the \"verdure grande\" for starters.  The caprese was excellent, composed of oozy cheese and bright refreshing tomatoes, topped with pine nuts and a light green dressing.  The verdure grande consisted of seven vegetable dishes in circular yellow jars for $28 - if you've ever been to Otto in New York, you've had them before.  The vegetables rotate, but on our visit we got lentils \"alla Toscana,\" roasted beets with saba, corn and tomatoes, radish in bagna cauda, marinated zucchine, eggplant caponata, and farro with pine nuts and feta.  Not every dish was spectacular, but all were decent, and I loved the lentils, beets, and corn.  The variety and freshness of the ingredients made the verdure grande worth getting.\n\nFor my entree, I couldn't pass up the cavatappi with lamb ragu, mint, and tomato.  The al dente corkscrew pasta was great, and the lamb ragu was on point, tender, well-seasoned, and meaty.  The tomato sauce was hearty and the mint added an accent of coolness that enhanced the warm flavors.  My mom's linguine con le cozze, a linguini with mussels, saffron, and marjoram, was another winning pasta.  It was very salty, but in a good way.  The pasta ended up being flavorful with minimal embellishment, and the saffron was pleasantly pronounced.  My brother's spaghettini with mushrooms, thyme, and garlic was also quite flavorful, lightly sauced but with a richness that came from the robust fragrant mushrooms.  Also good were my dad's veal and ricotta meatballs.  I love carbs, but it's hard to argue with lush, soft, juicy meatballs paired with nothing more than herbs and tomato sauce.  The only entree I didn't adore was my little brother's pizza with sausage and red peppers.  Even this was good, with zesty flavors and a thin crust, but the last time I had had Batali's pizza was at Mozza - the man sets his own bar.\n\nFor dessert, our table split two copettas, a fancy word for sundaes.  The espresso copetta came with espresso gelato, blackberry sorbetto, and fresh blackberries.  I wouldn't have thought to pair coffee and blackberries but this sundae was fantastic.  The flavors worked, and I liked that the espresso gelato had a bit of a coffee bean crunch.  The olive oil copetta was even better, boasting olive oil gelato with melon sorbetto and melon salad.  The sweet melon and the mellow salty olive oil were perfect together.  The melon salad added more ripe sugar as well as toothsome texture, and I doubt that the sundae could have been better.\n\nI rolled out of Enoteca San Marco in the early afternoon and didn't have another full meal until the next morning.  I gambled like a fiend all night and didn't feel particularly hungry.  I love Mario for enabling both my gluttony and my extended hours spent at poker tables.

I made a little money playing poker, so I only left $170 in Sin City.  That's for food, gas, hotel, everything.\n\nOne of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48.  My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner.  I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews.\n\nEarl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles.  I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A.  Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California.\n\nDon't be alarmed that it's a chain.  It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency.  There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers.  They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival.\n\nI ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce.  I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great.  It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them.  I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb.  The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing.  Peppers were optional and delicious.  Even the salad was pretty good.  It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing.  But it also had plenty of greens and tomato, cucumber, and cranberries.\n\nIf you're in Vegas for the full Vegas experience, go balls out, hit Robuchon, whatever you want.  But it's nice to know that you can eat something good for $5.99 and tax.  I love a good sandwich, and the Earl delivers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

Now that the show's behind me, I'm glad I checked it off my list but didn't love it like I thought I would. My husband had the same reaction.\n\nWe were told to arrive at least half an hour early to pick up tickets at will call, and moved dinner to an elderly hour in order to make that time. Picking up tickets took about one minute, and we could easily have arrived right on time--I think we couldn't even sit when we were told to arrive. This seemed like a pretty naked ploy to get us to gamble out of boredom and I was definitely tempted. We browsed the souvenir store and went to Starbucks instead.\n\nThe house was far from full (makes sense, as we were able to get discount tickets) and we had decent seats. I enjoyed the show, for the most part. The music and choreography and visual effects were good, and I loved the acrobatics. There were several really impressive numbers that focused on small groups of performers. (The aerialists were amazing). I preferred these to the giant ensemble pieces, which got kind of jumbled and boring. I also realized as I was watching this show that I don't care for circus humor. There was a part where a man dressed like a blackbird came out and cawed, and I just wanted to look away.\n\nI may just be an uncultured boor with a short attention span, but I definitely didn't want this show to be longer, and there were several times when I hoped it would end in the next five minutes. Also, I'm convinced that part of this show was pretty racist. There were thin white aerialists by the dozen, and only one black female performer. She came on stage to put her hands on her hips and thrust her pregnant belly up and down at a black male performer, who was shouting either gibberish, or another language presented to sound like gibberish--Africanese presented for laughs. (The performers didn't really speak otherwise, except for one narrator.) I was already watching with a measure of horror and incredulity when my husband leaned over and asked, \"Is it just me or is this really racist?\" I'm surprised Cirque hasn't gotten shit for this bit.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy I checked Love off my list, and I did have a good time watching acrobats fly and dance to Beatles music, which remained stuck in my head for weeks. If it weren't for the spot of racism there, I'd probably recommend the show freely, at least to people who are into Cirque.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3f-RP2-EE94eifGnepUBpg"}

We wanted to stay somewhere decent but affordable, and Celina C. mentioned she'd stayed in a Palazzo suite for another bachelorette.  My maid of honor Melissa K. did some research and booked us a suite for two nights.  I never saw the bill (thank you girls, really, you are the best) but was assured that the rate was reasonable.\n\nIt helped that there were nine of us staying in a one-room suite with two beds and a fold-out couch.  I'm not going to sit here and pretend that wasn't snug, but it wasn't uncomfortable either.  We brought one air mattress, and that was enough to ensure no one slept on the floor.  There was just the one bathroom, but we were all able to shower/get ready/use the toilet at the same time, at the small cost of our privacy.  Other than bedding and bathroom space, our suite didn't even feel crowded.  It was giant, with a comfortable sunken living room and a great view out the wide window.  We hung out in the hotel room a fair amount during our trip.  On our second night, we sat on the couches and played bachelorette party games.  The room was ideal for that kind of parlor gathering.  My friends even decorated it while two of them lured me away to gamble.  It was perfect.\n\nWe didn't gamble much this trip, and that was probably for the best.  We did take advantage of some of the other attractions - we spent a day by the pool, and ate at Grand Lux and Sushi Samba.

It was a nice hotel bar, with indoor lounge and bar seating, a big outdoor patio, and a lovely view. A great spot for a nightcap if you're staying at The Phoenician.\n\nThe vibe was upscale but relaxing--you would never confuse the Thirsty Camel for anything other than a hotel bar. We spent one night next to a large group of loud middle-aged white people on some kind of company retreat. I overheard one of the women proclaim proudly, \"Anyone who offends me who's a woman is a whore.\" Her male friends were super amused by that. Service was good. I appreciated that there was table service all night. The staff was attentive, even when we were sitting outside. They set us up with tasty bar nuts and brought our cocktails in good time.\n\nThe drinks were decent, nothing thrilling, but definitely solid. I enjoyed the Triple S, a spicy tequila cocktail made with El Tesoro Blanco, agave nectar, jalape\u00f1o, watermelon, and lime, with a hickory smoked-salt rim. The Phoenix Rising was apparently the signature cocktail, and this was good, made with Woodford Reserve bourbon, cointreau, orange juice, Angostura and Fee's orange bitters, grenadine, and orange peel. The Thirsty Sazerac was a serviceable sazerac, mixing Bulleit rye with green chartreuse, brown sugar, Angostura and Fee's lemon bitters, and lemon peel. If you're feeling spendy, the Five Diamond Manhattan is a well-made $20 Manhattan with Woodford Reserve, Carpano Antica, and Fee's barrel-aged bitters.\n\nI doubt I'd drink here if I weren't staying at this hotel, but that's kind of the great thing about hotel bars.

No. Back off. Go away. Off.\n\nI visited Vegas about a week before my birthday, so I went to Barneys to see if there was anything I wanted to buy for myself on my husband's behalf. There was a sale going on, and I browsed the shoes for a while, and almost convinced myself to get a beautiful but very impractical pair of Dries van Noten heels before moving on with my life. I like Barneys in general. Nice aesthetic, interesting shoes and clothes and bags, great for window shopping. This one was on the small side, but well organized and fun to browse.\n\nWhen I didn't find anything perfect to buy, I decided to get some makeup. (I must've really felt like spending money.) I found a great Nars lipstick and asked a beautifully made-up woman to help me find a few things and while she was at it, make my face look nice. I ended up looking kind of like a clown, but she was very sweet and I liked her a lot. (Also, clown make-up works okay in Vegas.) I ended up buying a powder in addition to the lipstick, and was relieved when the other two things I liked were out of stock.\n\nThe problem was not with this girl, but with the old woman representing a skincare line on the Barneys floor. She came over unasked and gave me what was more or less a mini facial to prep my skin for make-up. (I'd thought she was just going to put a little moisturizer on, but whoops.) I felt bad when she was done with her demo and thought about buying one of the products, since they seemed decent enough. I asked her to quote me prices, and they were insane. The moisturizer (which is the thing I thought about getting) was $190, and I think it went up from there. I declined, very awkwardly, but politely, by saying it was all out of my price range.\n\nHer response: \"You can open up a card.\"\n\nWait, WHAT? Look, I know that the Vegas economy pretty much depends on getting people to make bad decisions about money, but shouldn't that shit stay on the casino floor? Apparently not! You get hustled trying to buy fucking lipstick.\n\nWhen I said I couldn't afford $190 moisturizer, I didn't mean I didn't have $190 in my bank account--I meant that my current lifestyle does not accommodate $190 moisturizer and all the other shit that would come before I bought $190 moisturizer. If I actually only had $185 in my bank account, I should probably do other things with it before buying $190 moisturizer--like, for example, buying groceries and saving up to move out of my parents' house. I felt pretty confident about declining to open up a credit card, but I hope that never works on anyone. And even if it doesn't, the fucking gall of that woman. How does she sleep at night?\n\nAnyway, Barneys is fun, and if you have the money, there's plenty of ways to spend it. But don't open up a credit card to buy mysterious creams and serums. Just avoid that section altogether. It's a trap.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HnhDu5WPH35KBjBn2PNwbg"}

It's fancy and expensive, with a lovely upscale ambiance and top notch service. The carne and vino are excellent.\n\nI went for dinner with my family during a weekend stay at the Venetian. There were six of us, and we sat at a comfortable tucked-away table that felt like a luxury poolside cabana looking into the rest of the opulent dining room. Service was on point. Our waiter Corey was friendly and attentive, and he took really good care of us. The sommelier was also helpful. We asked her to recommend a wine and ended up getting a magnum of Barolo. It was a wonderful wine, perfect for our meal, and it came in the largest decanter I've ever seen, which the thin sommelier hefted around like a champ.\n\nThe food was delicious, actually much better than I expected given the Yelp reviews. I thought Carnevino was on par with other Batali restaurants, and I love me some Batali. Our meal kicked off with complimentary cheese bread, soft warm puffs packed with flavor, along with some crusty rosemary ciabatta rolls served with butter and lardo. We then shared a neat spread of appetizers. The best of these was the grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello. This was some of the best octopus I've ever had, tender and meaty, firm without any toughness. There was some nice heat to it too--I think there were some Fresno chiles in those pickled vegetables. The prosciutto di Parma \"riserva\" was great to share, a large platter of silky prosciutto ribbons, served with sliced apple. We added gnocchi fritto, these fried bready pillows, to eat with the prosciutto, and they were lovely. We also shared two pastas, which became appetizer-sized when split six ways. The beef cheek ravioli was tremendously good. Delicate triangles of pasta came stuffed with a rich, hearty filling of beef cheek, all served in a butter sauce drizzled with 20-year balsamic vinegar. This dish is a Carnevino and Batali signature (I'm pretty sure I've seen and coveted it...Iron Chef??), but it is technically off menu. Your server is sure to mention it, but if not, it's worth an inquiry. The orecchiette with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe was also fantastic, the thick, toothsome ears of pasta in a satisfying tomato sauce.\n\nFor the meat of our meal, we ordered both of the large format steaks--the dry aged bone-in ribeye and La Fiorentina, or classic Florentine porterhouse. This was a real feast, with both steaks carved up and served on enormous plates. Both were cooked a beautiful rare medium rare, red velvet with a seared, seasoned crust. They tasted different from each other but not in a way I could describe well, even at the time--they were both juicy and perfectly cooked, and I couldn't state a preference for one over the other. Just bring everyone you know and get both. We also ordered a couple sides--the charred brussels sprouts and the mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes. These were tiny sides, definitely sized for individuals, but we each all got a few bites of each. They were great. The sprouts were nice and roasty, with a pleasant brightness from the lemon zest in the gremolata. The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, laced with face bacon and a poached egg.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed by the time dessert came around, but we rallied and split a couple between the six of us. The chocolate peanut butter torte was a dense, gorgeous slice of indulgence, served with peanut brittle and salted caramel sauce. The gelato and sorbet was a great way to end the meal--we got lemon curd gelato and tangerine and blood orange sorbets, all citrusy, light, and not too sweet. About what I want after a whole lot of steak.\n\nThis was an expensive meal (most of it was comped, courtesy of the Venetian's love of Asian gamblers), but probably worth a splurge if you're looking to eat and drink well while on vacation. It's hard to beat good steak and wine, even harder to beat good steak, wine, octopus, pasta, etc. I'd love to come back to Carnevino, and will keep it in mind next time I'm looking to go big in Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3MmHmJXr8Ltk_Z5EGE4KUw"}

It was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.\n\nWe were staying at The Palazzo, and Sushi Samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  It was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  We had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  I wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (For management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  You know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)\n\nWe ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  I had a Blame it on Rio, a caipirinha variation with cacha\u00e7a, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalape\u00f1o.  It was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  The classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cacha\u00e7a, lime, and sugar.  I also tried some of the Chu-Cumber, a shochu drink with Hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  At some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  They held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.\n\nDinner was delicious.  We had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  We specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  It was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  We left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  The cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of Japanese and Peruvian styles.\n\nFirst, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  There was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and green bean tempura served with a rich black truffle aioli.  My favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  These were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  They were pretty irresistible.  Next we got a tray of Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza.  These were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  They came with kabocha pumpkin pur\u00e9e, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  The best thing I ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  The shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  The taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.\n\nAfter the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  I do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  The rolls were great, a nice mix of California standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more Samba-specific stuff, with the stray crab leg and lobster claw.  I particularly liked the Samba Strip, with Maine lobster tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  It was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  The rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  The sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  It was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers I had were great.\n\nThe most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  We got two hefty platters of the Rio Grande with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  These were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  They came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  We also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of roasted vegetables - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  We also got miso-marinated Chilean sea bass a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  This was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.\n\nWe were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  The lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  We each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.\n\nIn conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  Sushi Samba was an A+ choice, worthy of a night I won't soon forget.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NsnZ5GhagXBKrCOelxVQxw"}

But seek it out - if you're looking to gamble and like a slower bleed than Black Jack, the $1/$2 tables are great.\n\nThe room is not the biggest I've seen, but it's fairly nice and you get seated pretty fast.  The dealers are friendly and professional, and you get free drinks while you gamble.  I've only played in the MGM once, but I think I'll try and come back on future visits to Vegas.\n\nI'd heard beforehand that the MGM poker room was easy money, and the softness of my table didn't contradict that description.  We were playing nine-handed, and five of the players had no idea what they were doing, while the rest were so tight that you could just fold any time they made a move.  It was actually pretty boring, but I won almost every hand I got involved in, with one fold to an A9 that hit his two pair on the river.  I'm no poker guru, and would lose to a lot of the $1/$2 grinders that occupy various Vegas poker rooms.  I didn't see any of that type at my table.\n\nUntil I come back to the MGM poker room and lose some big hands, I will have a rosy view of the place.  I've also heard that it's a goldmine late at night, since it's close to a club.  I love poker but hate losing, so I hope this place is nice to me when I come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "opfcusUaTCZQKPSgt0_fMA"}

I guess it makes sense if you think about it - so many of the restaurants in Vegas require some major spending, and it's hard to justify eating out like a baller for every meal.  Besides, sometimes you just want to get a simple lunch where you can walk down in normal clothes with a hangover clear on your face.  L.A. has lots of options for that; the Palazzo has Grand Lux.\n\nI came here for just such a lunch with seven of my girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend.  We arrived around two o'clock and got seated right away.  Service was pretty slow, considering, but it was polite enough, and we weren't in a terrible hurry.  The interior - eh, I won't bother describing it.  If you're looking to eat at Grand Lux, chances are you've been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Same idea.\n\nI shared a Sonoma salad with Melissa K., my maid of honor.  Decent salad, big enough to share, with crispy greens, grilled chicken, avocado, bacon, fresh corn, sweet dates, golden raisins, onions, goat cheese, and glazed walnuts.  We got the hazelnut-mustard vinaigrette on the side.  I swapped a bit with June K. who ordered the seared rare ahi tuna salad.  This one came with romaine, radicchio, frisee, and avocado, tossed with a vinaigrette and piled high with seared ahi.  The tuna was pretty good.  If I come back to Grand Lux I might go for that one next time.\n\nLunch was nice and light, which was good - the rest of the itinerary included pool time, dinner, and club time, during which I would have to wear both a swimsuit and a dress I needed help getting into.  Grand Lux Cafe wasn't the most eventful part of the weekend, but it was a serviceable restaurant.  I'm glad it was an available option.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kwEQ3uY9Jwmknb5kNg3UlA"}

But night two of my bachelorette party was not the time to experiment - we stuck to our guns, and the night was great while it lasted.\n\nI don't like clubbing in L.A., but for some reason Vegas clubbing is pretty enjoyable.  Even though half the XS crowd is from Los Angeles, the composition is lighter on the every-Friday-with-my-boys sort than the Hollywood crowd, with a lot more repressed professionals cramming one weekend with moderate misbehavior.  I've been back to XS a couple times since 2009 (with my repressed professional friends), and it's my favorite club in Vegas.  I like the open layout, and the interior is really good-looking.  The music is good, and the club doesn't feel too cramped even when it's crawling with people.\n\nWhen we came for my bachelorette party, our friend Jason W. hooked us up and got us in for free.  He then bought us (all nine of us!) a round of shots, so thank you Jason for showing us a good time!  I was wearing a white dress and a tiara and all that, and I remember at least one stranger buying me a shot, too.  It all gets kind of hazy after that - I'd pounded a full cup of Jack and green tea in the hotel room, while my friends admonished me for not drinking fast enough.\n\nIn my memory, we were at XS for all of thirty minutes before I got sick and had to go home.  In reality, I guess we were there for a while.  There's iPhone footage of me and my old roommate standing in the pool and dancing, but that is the only evidence I've logged of that part of the evening.  I do remember snippets of my demise - on my knees in the bathroom, balled up in the cab line - but otherwise I just know that I woke up feeling awful, wearing pajamas, fake eyelashes, and a garter.  It was only then that I learned of the other casualties of the night.  Two of my friends had also gotten sick, including the one who was most responsible for my care - she held my hair, put me to bed, then puked at seven in the morning.  One of my friends cracked her phone, and another lost hers in a cab.  The drive back to L.A. was, uh, pretty rough.\n\nIf you tally the lost phones and damaged dignity, I guess you can't say our night at XS was free, but we paid nothing to the club and got a lot in return.

Goes to show that it pays to dine outside the box from time to time.\n\nService was swell and the atmosphere excellent, trendy but not obnoxiously so, with lovely Boteros hanging all over the walls.  There's a special kind of welcome in those paintings, an invitation to eat that can only be extended by adorable toonish fat people.  Perhaps this explains why I stuffed myself to miserable excess.\n\nIt started with the bread tray, which came with three types of bread.  I didn't try the sourdough, but the olive was great and the cranberry was absolutely fantastic.  The bar was set, and it was high.\n\nI came with a party of seven consisting of my very best friends who I've shared germs with since middle school, so this dinner was about as close to family style as you can get at a nice restaurant.  I had a fork in every pot, and there were many, many pots.  Everything was washed down with swills of a mellow pinot noir.\n\nA shellfish tower kicked us off with fresh bites of select oysters, gulf prawns, Maine lobster, crab, and raw scallops in tangy sauce.  I found the lobster to be the least enjoyable tier of that particular tower.  The oysters and scallops were excellent.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the olive oil poached halibut with haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, and warm balsamic vinaigrette.  This was a lovely piece of fish.  We split a variety of sides, which were great.  The asparagus and mushrooms were solid, and the truffled mac and cheese was a knock-out, smooth, rich, and aromatic.  The bone marrow with onion jam was a treat in that I'd never had bone marrow before, but I found it a little disappointing, with less flavor than I'd hoped for.\n\nBites from the buffet that is my friends' plates revealed a whole range of yumminess.  My favorite of the bunch was the \"pinwheel of wild salmon,\" which was salmon prepared two ways, both delicious.  One involved a butternut squash and apple risotto, and the other a roasted cauliflower puree and lemon caper emulsion.  The salmon was nicely cooked and the accompanying flavors were a good interesting mix of sweet, salty, and yum.  Ahi tuna tartare with mango, avocado, and crispy ginger was also a notable dish.  The organic roasted chicken and the prime rib were good, but not particularly moving.  Ditto for the potato gnocchi with roasted tomato and parmesan - decent gnocchi but mildly boring.\n\nDessert was excellent.  By the time the menus came around most of our party felt too stuffed to order and we ended up splitting two desserts (that's me eating 70%, the other six people eating 30%, as I am not a normal, socially acceptable human being).  The warm banana bread pudding with homemade banana ice cream was just dazzling.  The mini ice cream sandwiches (chocolate with vanilla, chocolate with mint, strawberry cheesecake, and rocky road) came in an adorable rack and tasted great, my favorite being the rocky road.\n\nAll in all, this was a fabulous meal in a pleasant environment.  I was very happy that I had chosen to wear a rather billowy dress to dinner, because underneath those skirts, my belly was straight out of a Botero.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3AlN2XZ0I0F8650y2yjLWA"}

We decided to check out Azure while we were there, in case we wanted a bit more party with our pool time.\n\nWe would've been mad if we'd paid money to get in.  Since we were a group of girls, we got in free, and we were able to scope the place out without paying cover.  What we found was a smaller version of the normal hotel pool, with loud music and more people.  There was no atmosphere - the Palazzo pool is one of the more standard Vegas pools anyway, and the Azure version was maybe even blander.  It was, in other words, worse than the free hotel pool in every possible way.\n\nWe ended up spending the afternoon in the Palazzo pool, and the few scattered children didn't bother us at all.  It was a relaxing day, and not too hot despite the rather intense temperatures.  If you're curious about Azure, I'd say check it out if you don't have to pay.

I remember getting little containers filled with beets and rabe and mushrooms, and eating them alone in Washington Square Park. This Otto is less affordable than the original--even New York can't rip you off quite like Vegas--but it's equally pleasant, with excellent food and a casual, friendly ambiance.\n\nOtto is in the Venetian, in the central spot formerly occupied by Enoteca San Marco, which was more or less Otto by another name. You dine faux al fresco, under the painted Venetian sky, and you yield to the gleeful corniness of your surroundings. My husband and I came for a late dinner, right off a Friday night flight to Vegas. We had a reservation, but it looked like we could've walked in. Our waiter Eli L. was excellent. He took his time recommending both food and wine, and attended to all our needs with warmth and absolute competence.\n\nWe drank red wine by the glass--Montepulciano and Barbera--and indulged in a wonderful meal. There was fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic, and we ordered a big spread of starters. We got prosciutto di Parma and coppa, which were both excellent, as well as a plate of gooey taleggio served with black truffle honey and syrup-stewed cherries and apricots. We also got a pot of Otto pickles, which overflowed with baby carrots, cauliflower, fennel, radish, and turnip, all crisp and zippy with brine. Feeling extra indulgent, fresh off the plane, we got the caprese with oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, pesto, and milky burrata. Entrees were probably unnecessary at this point, but we did finish our pastas with alacrity. I had the linguini special, cooked a nice al dente with shrimp, garlic, and chile. My husband had the tagliatelle with butternut squash, brown butter, and sage. This one was too sweet for me, but he liked it. We ended this decadent meal with a bowl of sorbet and gelato--huckleberry, lemon, and olive oil, all perfect and perfect together.\n\nDinner was expensive, but that tends to happen in Vegas, and I thought it was very worthwhile.

My friend June had been to Holsteins on an earlier Vegas trip and come back raving that it was the one restaurant she'd hit that she wanted to revisit.  I can't tell you how many times I stared drooling at the menu before we went for dinner.\n\nHolsteins is in the new and beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel, and it's right across from Marquee.  We went and got stamped for the Marquee before we checked in for dinner, and we ended up missing our reservation (held for fifteen minutes).  The staff was nice about it, though, and it turned out that seating, even for a party of seven, was not a problem.  Holsteins is a swanky place, with comfortable booths and a giant pink cow on display.  We had a waiter named Chaz, and he was friendly and on his game.\n\nThe drinks were everything I wanted and more.  The spiked milkshakes were absolutely delicious.  The Frozen Grasshopper came with peppermint meringue, chocolate crunchies, creme de menthe, and Van Gogh Dutch chocolate vodka.  I can't imagine it was terribly boozy, but it was a fabulous milkshake, with full mint chocolate flavor and the perfect thickness.  The little meringue was delightful, and the crunchy chocolate bits added texture to every sip.  The Brown Cow was also fantastic, an adult root beer float made with root beer, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks, and Charbay Tahitian vanilla rum.  It had all the kid-pleasing taste of a great root beer, and I can't overstate the fun of pop rocks.  I also tried the Bloody Mary, without ice cream, but with Smirnoff infused with pepper and cilantro, combined with Bloody Mary mix and garnished with a toothpick bearing an olive and a cocktail shrimp.  I love a good Bloody Mary, and this was a good one.  It had a heavy spicy flavor but a thin clean texture, and I appreciate food in my drink when appropriate.\n\nOur table split three appetizers, and that felt like the right amount.  The fried pickles were easily my favorite, breaded and deep-fried dill spears, olives, and caper berries, served with small sides of prosciutto and salami and an herb-caper mayo for dipping.  These were magical.  The breading was flavorful, crispy, and light, and the pickles oozed their pickly flavor.  I would also recommend the bucket of buffalo wings, which came with a bleu cheese dip.  Nothing fancy, but delicious.  I was disappointed, though, by the truffle lobster mac' n cheese.  The creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce was more creamy than it was cheesy, making the appetizer more like a macaroni salad.  The Maine lobster was barely there, and the black truffle didn't come through.\n\nThe burgers were very good, though I suspect that the strength may lie in the toppings.  The classic - with just lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, ketchup, and pickles - was the most boring of the bunch, and that doesn't hold true with a remarkable patty.  The patties were definitely tasty, though, with plenty of juice, and they held up well to some fun accompaniments.  My favorite was the Rising Sun.  With a Kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado, it was definitely a loaded gimmick of a fusion burger - but damn if I didn't gobble it down.  The teriyaki was sweet but not cloying, and the salt of the speckles of dried seaweed was great.  The crispy yam gave a welcome crunch, and that strip of avocado tempura was creamy and beautiful.  The Gold Standard was also good, a dry-aged beef sirloin burger topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli.  It was less of a stand-out, though, and the tomato confit did not bring on the umami parade I'd hoped for.  If you like lamb burgers, the Big Fat Greek is a good choice.  With Greek spiced lamb, feta cream, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and red onion and olive relish, it's a little like a Greek menu threw up on a burger.  The result, though, is hearty and pretty well done.\n\nThe burgers all come with a side of fries, and you have a choice of shoestring, sweet potato, and steak cut.  I prefer my thin fries, and the shoestring and sweet potato were both superb.  Holsteins knows its way around a potato - even the steak cut fries were well seasoned and not at all mushy.\n\nWhen we left for Marquee we were all stuffed to the brim.  The meal was not cheap - burgers started at $13 and shakes were $11 - but it was a satisfying feast that hardly qualified as a splurge in Vegas.  I've had better burgers, but I was impressed by the Rising Sun, and I doubt I've had better milkshakes.  If you're in Vegas hankering for a fattening meal, check Holsteins out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

In fact I'm mostly updating this just to document my bachelorette party in full, so if you want to see a full useful review, please see the original and ignore this post, which is basically for my diary use only.\n\nWe came at around seven o'clock and were told they were so backed up they were turning people away.  We put our name and number down anyway, expecting to wait at least an hour and a half.  I guess a lot of people were discouraged enough to bail, because we were seated after something like forty minutes.\n\nService was good, polite and moderately quick.  A few of my friends and I use FourSquare (sorry, Yelp), and we each got a complimentary Holstein's Spacial (not a typo on my end) Lager.  It was tasty, refreshing, and free, and I'm sorry to admit that we were too full to finish them and felt pretty bratty.  We did leave a nice tip.\n\nI did try a couple new things this time around, and I'll just note those here.  The Fun-Ghi (hey, you know that joke, don't you?) was a great burger with a beef patty, roasted portobello, caramelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere, frisee, and aioli.  The mushroom was great, and went really well with the beef.  All the other accompaniments took a back seat, letting the two top players have their day.  For dessert, we supplemented our Frozen Grasshopper with a Campfire Smores shake - Smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow, and a graham cracker crumble.  I mean please I will never stock Smirnoff marshmallow vodka in my home bar, but it worked here.  The shake tasted like s'mores, and it was delicious.\n\nMy girls got my dinner, for which I am very grateful.

Many thanks to you, Justin.\n\nWe were seated right away, and a waiter took our drink order. I got a bottomless Bloody Mary for an $13. It was quite good, spicy and satisfying, and our waiter replaced it without prompting and without comment, whenever it got close to empty. This waiter was great, by the way. He didn't have to do very much for us, and he still managed to come off as wonderfully pleasant and attentive. Or maybe he just bribed me with those fast booze refills.\n\nMy favorite thing about buffets is that you can start eating immediately, and as soon as we secured our table and ordered our drinks, we hit the various stations. The spread was diverse and extravagant, and I filled up plates in a few different rounds. My husband and I have very different palates, and it was funny how little overlap there was between our plates. He got stuff like carved beef and macaroni and, good lord, bread, while I created a monstrosity of a lunch made up of stir-fried noodles, fried rice, teriyaki chicken, sushi, curried beef, curried lamb, gnocchi, and on and on and on. I thought the presentation was pretty appetizing across the board, with a lot of dishes individually portioned in attractive little containers. Definitely a step up, even visually, from your standard buffet. The food was also quite tasty, most of it not memorable but very good to eat. The bone marrow was probably the highlight, and I understand why it's the thing to get at Wicked Spoon. Where else can you have AYCE bone marrow? When we went, it came with a lovely kimchi glaze, and it was delicious. I filled up on savory stuff and mostly ignored the dessert table (buffet pastries are never as good as they look, and always make me feel bad), but went straight for the gelato station. Great gelato. I had some strawberry balsamic and pistachio gelato, and both hit the spot. I would've been perfectly happy if I'd gotten this gelato at its own shop.\n\nI don't think I'd wait in a huge line and pay full boat to get into Wicked Spoon (I'd probably do one or the other), but I enjoyed my lunch and thought it was a great value at half price.

Would I laugh out loud if a wealthy friend built a replica in her own home?  Most certainly.

The draped crystals make a beautiful backdrop for some fun pictures.\n\nAnd now that you all think I'm obnoxious as hell for taking pictures and not spending money at a bar, I'll just say that The Chandelier is at the top of my list when I do come back, and when I do want a nice cocktail.

The menu tilted light and fruity, perfect for drinkers who don't actually like the taste of alcohol.  I like my booze to taste like booze, but the cocktails were pretty great.  The group favorite was the strongest anyway, the Spiced Apple Jack made with Laird's spiced applejack, yuzu sour, apple juice, rosemary-infused simple syrup, and a balsamic reduction.  This was a stellar drink, well balanced and full of fun flavors that blended well together.  I think half of our group ordered this one.  We also sampled the Misty Rose and The Butterfly cocktails, and these were good, too.  Misty Rose happens to be the name of the color of my bridesmaids' dresses (apparently very popular at J. Crew), so this was a fitting drink, with the right peachy pink color.  It came with Hendrick's gin, St. Germain, and rose syrup, and it was light and went down easy.  The Butterfly featured Hangar One Mandarin Blossom, Aperol, mango and strawberry pure\u00e9, and yuzu sour.  Similar idea - fruity, pleasant, the booze so disguised a child could drink it on accident.\n\nWe didn't stay the whole night, but we filled most of our down time hanging out in this lounge.  I like The Cosmopolitan, but since it's home to some of the more popular clubs and restaurants on The Strip, it would be almost unmanageably difficult to visit without The Chandelier to make the wait times easy.

My first night of this same trip, I had a great time at XS - I'm not just an old lady grumbling about clubs.\n\nI am grumbling that this particular club, due to its status as Vegas's newest, is an unenjoyable clusterfuck, with people packed like rats onto strangely small dance floors.  We tried to maneuver our way onto the floor in the only area playing hip hop, and we couldn't even get our elbows in.  Elsewhere, the music was bad and weird, with lots of irritating house and techno.\n\nThe best parts of the club were the outdoor areas, and Marquee gets that extra star because I liked the pool and the surrounding tables.  Of course, after a certain hour, you need to sign over your firstborn before you get to use a table, but I suppose if you're not too attached to your DNA the space is nice.  The outdoor areas are also fairly breathable, and some of the views are wonderful.  It was a cold night when I went, so I suppose I didn't get to enjoy these things thoroughly.  I also didn't really mind a random balcony we found, where we were able to take off our shoes and observe the dance floor.  But it wasn't glamorous, and it wasn't really part of the designated club experience.  \n\nProbably also not a part of that experience?  Those ridiculous bleacher stairs.  Marquee is huge, like several stories high, and the night we went, the elevators were down.  From what I understand, even when they're operable, it's sometimes better to take the stairs.  To which I respond - what?  Then why does the stairwell look like the kind of shady back-of-the-building place where a girl in high heels might be murdered?  And more relevant to most - why am I expected to take these stairs in five inch heels, so that I almost eat shit by skidding off a step in front of the people in Marquee, who number in the thousands?\n\nAnyway, if you must check out the hottest new club in Vegas blah blah blah, go for it.  If you're a girl, you're still best off if you know someone, and if that someone likes you, you can get in free.  If you're a boy, that same someone will still charge you $45.  We had no hassle getting in, which makes it even more amazing that I didn't have the time of my life.  (I also spent $0 inside, having pre-gamed in the hotel room and at dinner.)  We went early, and if you are inclined to check this place out, do show up as soon as you can.  Get a stamp and go to dinner if you have to - they won't guarantee your reentry, but it worked fine for us.\n\nWhile I won't be surprised if I find myself back here, I can say with confidence that it will not be my choice.  Marquee's infestation of people and parking lot stairs really turned me off, and I will have to be plied with vodka before I'm willing to return.  I suppose in Vegas, though, that can easily be arranged.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ht8mXLuqJSTPrU9kvzosUA"}

Both were very annoying, and both fell during mealtime.  I went to Hissho to eat both times.\n\nThe first time, I was rushing to make my connecting flight and stopped off on Hissho to grab a roll.  There was a refrigerated section of to-go food, and the selection was pretty good - standard, sure, but a lot of options.  It took me a minute to pick an eel roll.  I ate it on the plane, and it was good.  It reminded me of the pre-packaged rolls I used to love at the cafeteria in college.  Nothing special, maybe, but satisfying.\n\nSo when I passed by Hissho in the same airport on a longer layover just a couple months later, I decided to sit down for some dinner.  I thought about getting another ready-to-go roll, but I made the mistake of opening the menu.  I had just heard Jonathan Gold review a Sinaloan sushi spot on the radio, and he said something like, \"It was good in the way chili fries are good,\" and for some reason that resulted in my ordering something called a Mango Trio.  It was an 8 piece roll with imitation crab, mango, cucumber, and mango-ginger cheese topped with salmon, tuna, and a mango habanero sauce.  I mean what the hell is mango-ginger cheese?  Anyway, the roll was edible but vaguely disgusting, with mediocre fish and an odd, goopy sauce.\n\nMy other big mistake was getting a drink.  I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, and when I saw a chipotle bloody on the menu I decided to go for it.  It was the most disgusting bloody mary I've had in recent memory, very strong with a tinge of thin tomato and a bit of spice.  It had a double shot of vodka, so I guess it was at least functional.  When I got the check, though, I was shocked to see that it cost $14.  My shitty airport meal cost over $30.  Incidentally, service was also very slow.  Surprising considering the setting.\n\nI left for my flight feeling foolish.  I would've been happier with a spicy tuna in a plastic container.  I may come back to Hissho when I fly through CLT, but I won't sit down again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Vf_Ng_A1KKOrD0Bggx-ueg"}

We'd just flown into town and were looking forward to an easy gastropub dinner. The place was not at all what we expected. It was less gastropub than full-on upscale sit-down restaurant, with entrees creeping into the $30 range. Thankfully, we ended up loving the place.\n\nCitizen Public House is in cozy Old Town Scottsdale, and it was vibrant and charming on a Friday night. We had a late reservation (9:15) and the place was still pretty busy. I liked the atmosphere--it was nice, but informal. We hadn't seen Stef in four years, and had a great time catching up over dinner. Service was excellent. Our waiter Brad was on top of his game.\n\nWe had a couple rounds of drinks, and I really enjoyed the cocktails. The Im-Port was particularly good, a smokey drink made with Jameson, Tawny Port, tobacco bitters, and Guinness foam, served on the rocks with a smoked sugar rim. The Thai Margarita was pleasant, too, a mix of Patron silver with galangal and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, Thai chili sea salt, basil, and lime, served on the rocks. It tasted more like a straight margarita than I thought it would, but I liked it. I also had a sample of the barrel-aged Craftsman, made with Jameson, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay green tea apertif. (Brad brought it over because I was waffling between the Im-Port and the Craftsman, and he gave me a free taste after I'd already decided on the Im-Port.) It was pretty great, smooth and boozy with a definite sweetness. Probably would've gotten it if I wanted a third drink. Matt tried one of the other barrel-aged cocktails, the Boulvardier [sic?] made with Maker's 46 bourbon, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Another solid drink.\n\nThe food was fantastic. The three of us shared the pork belly pastrami and an order of Bernie's mac 'n cheese, which worked as both appetizer and side. The pork belly pastrami seems to be Citizen Public House's signature dish, and it's a great one. Pork belly came pastrami-cured and spiced, with rye spaetzle, brussels sprout sauerkraut, and mustard jus. The pork was juicy, fatty, and intensely flavorful, and I loved all of the sides. It wouldn't be right to come here without trying this dish. The mac 'n cheese was also delicious, made with curly cavatappi pasta in a gorgonzola and emmental cheese sauce, with a chilled tomato relish on top. The pasta was cooked al dente and I loved the sharp cheeses and the spicy tomato relish. The portion was huge. We split it three ways and still had leftovers.\n\nI had the pan-seared scallops for my entree, while Matt and Stef had the fair trade short ribs. Both were excellent. The scallops were plump and beautifully cooked, served with Hampshire belly bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens, and a cola gastrique. There was so much great flavor and texture on this plate. It was exactly what I wanted. The short ribs were another winner, a giant plate of tender coffee-rubbed ribs with dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree, and seasonal vegetables.\n\nWe ended up spending more than we meant to at Citizen Public House, but we were on vacation and had a truly lovely meal. I'd recommend this place for a nice dinner out in Scottsdale, to locals and tourists alike.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA"}

It's small and welcoming, and you can see the pizzas getting fired.  You order at the register and take a seat at one of the tables.  There isn't a ton of seating, but it looks to be enough, and there's even some seating outside.  I sat by myself next to a table of high school boys talking about girls.\n\nMichelle hooked me up with a full meal on the house, and it was delicious.  Garlic knots came piping hot with great chewy insides and a heft dose of garlic.  For my pizza, I ordered red pie with sausage, mushrooms, and artichoke - it was excellent.  The pizza was thin with a great crust, and the toppings were perfectly done.  The sausage was savory and hefty, and I loved the saut\u00e9ed mushroom and generous hunks of artichoke heart.\n\nI tipped $20 because I had nothing else on me and I was getting free room and board from the woman who served as my hostess.  This was probably more than the comped meal would have cost - I hope that convinces everyone that this review isn't 100% bias.  Pizza Re is just great.

The first time, I went alone, and to save money I drove from L.A. to Phoenix and back in about 24 hours, and crashed with someone I met through Couchsurfing--on an armchair and ottoman, actually, no couch. That was fun and all, but I decided to use some Starwood Points last year and upgrade to The Phoenician. We were going to do the same thing this time around, but when we looked into booking, we noticed that The Phoenician went from a category 5 to a category 6 (sorry, this probably means nothing to you if you're not a Starwood member), making it cost the same number of points as The Canyon Suites. We decided to go for The Canyon Suites, and it was pretty damn nice.\n\nThe two properties are part of the same resort, with The Canyon Suites being a bit quieter and more tucked away, with nicer rooms and a dedicated pool. We took advantage of the Thirsty Camel at The Phoenician, and used both pools during our stay. We also took a walk around the cactus garden, which was pretty spectacular. We brought our own books, but if not we might have taken advantage of the well-stocked bookcase in the lobby. Our room was gorgeous, large and luxurious with a great bathroom and comfortable bed.\n\nService was top notch. The staff was super attentive and we got what felt like real VIP treatment the entire weekend. We were welcomed with a box of chocolates and other treats gathered from local chocolate and treat artisans. Staff greeted us every time we walked around the property. There was even a shuttle between The Canyon Suites and The Phoenician, but the distance was so short we would've felt stupid taking it.\n\nI don't know that I can stay at this resort every time I'm in town (for one thing, I'm running low on Starwood points) but I'd love to come back for another desert getaway.

Two of our friends had already gotten some attached, and they looked so good we decided to make the short trip.  We were helped by a couple of nice ladies in the Make Up Forever section of the store.  Attachment came free with purchase, and I left with huge false eyelashes and no make-up on my face, a good look for sure.\n\nIt's worth noting that if you want your make-up done in store, you have to make an appointment.  We tried to walk in, and all the make-up artists were booked well in advance.  I guess lots of ladies like to get their make-up done professionally before going out in Vegas.

When we got to the counter on a Friday evening, there was no line.\n\nAmazingly, some horrible asshole managed to cut us as we approached the counter--he slid over from an adjacent rental company's counter and just stood in front of us. We were about three feet from the counter at the time. It was so blatant I think the Sixt representative should have said something.

He'd come over to Sixt to haggle after getting too high a quote at the next counter, and he seemed to think he was driving a hard bargain.

We found Evo on Yelp and managed a same-day 7:00 reservation. We were a little worried because there was a check-in special for a $0.01 fireball shot, but this proved to be at least somewhat incongruous with the restaurant.\n\nThe place was pretty classy, with nice decor, date-night lighting, and a decent crowd. We were seated near a bachelorette party, but it seemed like their first stop of the night. Our waiter was very friendly and earnest. He had the menu down pat and when I asked for recommendations, he gave detailed answers. I didn't need him to explain what squid ink pasta was, but I found his enthusiasm charming. Also, half an hour into our meal, I heard the man at the table next to us ask what kale was, and our waiter was ready.\n\nWe passed on the fireball shots (we'd actually had fireballs at a different kind of bar a few weeks earlier, and things ended poorly) and opted for a bottle of Nero d'Avola, which was good and decently priced. It went well with our meal.\n\nWe started with the charred octopus and the charcuterie board, and both were pretty great. The octopus was tender with a savory char, and it came with romesco and crispy pimento potatoes, which were lovely. The charcuterie board was definitely the centerpiece of our meal, a walloping board loaded with meat, cheese, bread, pickles, and other accompaniments. There was blackberry terrine, spicy salami, and mortadella; drunken goat cheese, Celtic cheddar, triple-creme brie, and manchego; golden raisin, fig jam, pickled okra; and on top of it all, a big split bone brimming with marrow. It was a bountiful feast, and everything on the platter was solidly tasty.\n\nPasta was almost overkill (in fact, our server warned us we might be getting too much food), but we went for it--we came to Evo craving pasta in the first place. Unfortunately, this course was a step down from the appetizers. I got the squid ink chittara, which sounded right up my alley--thin-cut pasta with lump crab, scallion, uni butter, Calabrian chile, and toasted breadcrumbs. None of these ingredients really stood out to me. The flavors were muted, and worse, the pasta clumped, making for gluey morsels. Matt's pappardelle was better, if not memorable, a basic plate of thick pasta with grana padano, tomato, basil, herbs, and a veal, pork, and beef ragu.\n\nWe passed on dessert and left quite full, more or less satisfied despite mediocre pastas.

There was also complimentary valet parking for the Camelback Esplanade. But about that Camelback Esplanade--it was this nice complex with fancy restaurants and shops, but it felt very mall-like, sterile and soulless, a plaza attached to a wealthy, unimaginative suburb. Ten was tucked deep in the Esplanade. The ambiance was comfortable and casually upscale, but it did feel vaguely like a chain restaurant. I was also disappointed in the selection of spirits, given the emphasis in the restaurant's name. None of the cocktails sounded interesting, and there were no beers on tap. The wine was reasonable, at least. We ended up splitting a $34 bottle of pinot noir. It was decent.\n\nAtmosphere aside, we did have a lovely dinner. My husband and I caught up with two school friends who'd moved to Phoenix, one of whom we hadn't seen in years. Service was good, and the meal was pleasant and relaxing. The food was also quite solid. We shared some hush puppies, and these were excellent, fresh from the fryer with a crispy crust to the outsides and fluffy but substantial innards. They came with a crumble of bacon and blue cheese, with a rouille dipping sauce on the side. Lots of good flavor all around. I got the pot roast for my entree, and this was good, if not amazing. The roast was tender and moist, if not in every bite, and it tasted hearty and comforting. It came with mashed potatoes and carrots--the potatoes were great, especially with the drippings of the roast, but the carrots were pretty bland and easy to ignore. My husband's roasted pork shoulder was the better entree, a gorgeous plate of slow roasted pork cooked just right, with a sweet BBQ glaze and a mashed potatoes and collard greens on the side. Definitely the thing to get here--my husband was very happy, and I was a little bit jealous.\n\nI had a nice time at Ten. I enjoyed the food and wine and company, and would be inclined to come back if I lived in Phoenix. I guess I will say it's not necessarily worth going out of your way for, despite the rave reviews. The atmosphere struck me as strange, but maybe that's just the Angeleno in me.

I'm glad we took that enticement, though--I loved this place, and would be happy to go back next time I'm in this part of Vegas.\n\nThe space is great, comfortable and lovely, a melding of Southern charm and trendy Vegas pizzazz. We sat at a big table for brunch, and in nice lounge seating for drinks. The place seemed constantly busy, but not at full capacity. Service was great--helpful, timely, and friendly.\n\nI sampled most of the cocktail menu over the course of this day, and I was pretty impressed with the showing. I had a Bloody Mary to start my brunch, and this was a fiery hot Bloody Mary, slightly thinner than I like but definitely tasty, garnished with a stuffed olive, a pickled green bean, pickled okra, a wedge of lime, and some bacon for good measure. Of the constructed cocktails on the menu, I particularly loved the Southern Revival and The Porkchop. The Southern Revival was a balanced mix of Wild Turkey 81, passion fruit, and basil, with just the right amount of sweetness. The Porkchop was more unusual, made with Duke bourbon, dijon syrup, yuzu juice, and apple cider, served with a dijon thyme cube. This was savory, but not aggressively so, and I loved the way the ice cube yielded more flavor as it melted. I liked a few cocktails that seemed made for sipping on a sunlit porch--the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade made with Buffalo Trace, blackberry puree, lemon, cardamom, and Angostura bitters; the Watermelon Sling, with High West Silver Oat Whiskey, pressed watermelon juice, lemon, and Aperol; and the Southern Peach, with Old Forester 86, Aperol, lemon, thyme, white peach puree, and sweet tea. On the boozier end, I enjoyed the Yardbird Old Fashioned, featuring bacon-infused Buffalo Trace, Angostura bitters, orange bitters, and maple syrup. Probably would've been great with breakfast, actually.\n\nThe food was excellent, hearty Southern fare presented with a Vegas chef's edge. Our party of seven ordered a bunch of food to share, and it was a satisfying feast, with fried chicken as its anchor. We ordered one each of Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken and the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Lewellyn's was the plainer platter, just half a free range chicken made with a \"27-hour\" recipe, served with a honey hot sauce. The bigger dish came with fried chicken, honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, and bourbon maple syrup. The chicken was delicious, juicy and flavorful with crispy fried skin, and I loved the accompaniments, the soft, chewy savory waffle and the refreshing watermelon. We supplemented the chicken with a Yardbird Benedict, a butter lettuce and grilled mango salad, and a few sides. (My picky husband also had a plain waffle by himself, which he enjoyed with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and bourbon maple syrup.) The benedict was fantastic, with soft poached egg and house-cured bacon over a buttermilk biscuit crumble, all loaded with hollandaise. There was a little salad with a zippy pickled vinaigrette on the side. The lettuce and mango salad was our healthy order, but it was no filler--it came with fresh butter lettuce, char-grilled mango, smoked pecans, and a benne seed vinaigrette, all very good. For our sides, we ordered the skillet cornbread, the buttermilk biscuits, and the macaroni and cheese, all of which were very strong. The cornbread was dense and buttery, speckled with poppy seed and goat cheese. The flaky biscuits came with house blackberry jam and maple butter. Even the mac and cheese was pretty special, made with torchio pasta, a mix of five artisanal cheeses, and a crispy herb crust. It was fun making a plate with chicken and bits of salad and sides--it felt like a Vegas Thanksgiving.\n\nMy Vegas trips tend to cluster around the Venetian/Palazzo, and if they continue to do so, I'm sure I'll be back to Yardbird soon. It's now at the top of my list for a casual meal or a fancy cocktail away from the casino floor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VheAZ3k8hL4QJTFxpeFGmA"}
