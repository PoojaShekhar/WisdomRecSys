We were excited about a place that serves up hot dogs and warrants five stars!\n\nEven though they sold burgers and sandwiches, you have to order some type of sausage or dog when that's what they are famed for.  My friend and I opted for the Polish Sausage ($3.25), the BF chose the Bratwurst ($3.29), and my other friend went for their Regular Hot Dog ($2.05).  I read about their fabulous milkshakes, so chose a Chocolate Shake ($3.05) and their amazing Onion Rings ($2.59).\n\nI requested all the sausages and dogs to be loaded up with everything, which looked like it included onions, peppers, a pickle spear, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  I must admit, they did look a bit smaller than what I'm used to.  And the cashier couldn't tell the difference between the Polish Sausage and the Bratwurst.\n\nIn terms of the hot dog, my friend was not impressed. He said the hot dog itself tasted like any other hot dog, but he did like all the fixings on top.  The polish sausage tasted a lot better than the bratwurst in my opinion.  You can see lots of spices and stuff in the polish sausage, but there wasn't enough kick for my tastes.\n\nThe chocolate milkshake was thick and made from real ice cream.  Their onion rings reminded me of an onion blossom because of their thin batter.  I wished they had a different kind of dipping sauce for it instead of ketchup.\n\nOverall, my experience at Ted's Hot Dogs was just okay.  Maybe it's a locals thing and you have to be a true local to really appreciate their hot dogs and sausages.

However, instead of going to the S. Maryland Parkway one in Vegas, I was at the N. Stephanie location in Henderson.\n\nAs always, I had a regular order of pork lau lau.  It was about $7 and came with two small scoops of rice and one small scoop of mac salad.  The mac salad was creamy and peppery.  Imagine my surprise though to find not one, but TWO pork lau laus in my order!  Wow!  They were already getting four stars just for serving up two of these babies.  In all my years of ordering this stuff, I have never gotten two in a regular order.  (They never offer a mini order of pork lau lau either.)  However, the pork lau lau was a bit watery.  It wasn't dry, thank gawd.  But it lacked flavor.  I had to douse it with a lot of soyu, unfortunately.  They did have a good amount of pork and fatty goodness in there though.\n\nThe BF requested a combo with Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs.  His order cost $7.70.  Upon opening the box, he saw the chicken was a bit darker than he would have preferred, either it's from over-frying it, or old oil.  I think it was from the former because the katsu was really crunchy.  His order was surprisingly large and we both ended up with leftovers.  His short ribs had a distinctive sauce on the ribs, like they put the sauce on top of it after it was cooked.\n\nCleanliness of the store was an issue here.  Initially, we were seated at a booth and saw this red sauce on the wall.  \"Uh, is that hot sauce?\"   \"Yeah.\"  \"Uh, okay then...let's move.\"  There is hot sauce up on these walls, and dark marks too that I think a good wipe down would take care of.  They obviously have a leak in their ceiling as you can see by the dark water stains from above.  And it's just a bit grimy here.  I don't think anything bothers to clean up the tables or seats here.  \n\nSidenote: They do offer a weekday lunch special.  For $4.95, you get  a choice of chicken katsu, BBQ chix, or BBQ pork, and it comes with a 16 oz soda, their daily appetizer, rice, and mac salad.\n\nOverall, I give them four stars for the amount of food you're getting for the price.  In terms of quality, that's where the stars go down.  And plus, stuff on the walls should always bring your star mark down too.  Take your order to go so you won't have to see the grime.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Ouo2D7E5Yz8OG7xB--yug"}

It didn't really have the details, so I helped myself to a regular menu.

(They should really let you know.)\n\n* Spicy Wings \"Fuego-seasoned chicken wings basted in our smoky BBQ sauce served with ranch dressing.\" - Again, this was just okay as well.  The Husband definitely has had his share of better wings.\n\nMeanwhile, our chips and salsa had been empty and no one offered to refill it.  Even a manager came by our table and asked how everything was and we said fine.  She didn't even notice that we were lacking chips and salsa.  (Obviously she came by out of habit, but really doesn't pay attention to her customers' needs.)  We also had to ask for refills on water.\n\nAnd sadly, their chips and salsa aren't even great anymore.  I'm actually preferring Chili's version right now.\n\nOverall, our bartender/waiter was just not good.  He didn't pay any attention to us despite us sitting so close to the bar.  We did notice another table of two getting a lot better customer service from a different bartender/waiter.  He checked on their table often, unlike ours.\n\nIt was just not a good experience and the food was just okay.

Our hostess for the evening brought over a round of drinks on the house including some appetizers to try.  \n\n* Dublin's Sampler Platter \"This favorite combines full orders of our Cheese Dip, Chicken Tenders and Chicken Boxty Quesadillas.\" $19.95 \n\n* Cheese Dip and Wedges \"A creamy blend of three cheeses served with boxty wedges for dipping.\" $6.95 - What makes this appetizer unique is their wedges.  Tasty things and who doesn't love cheese for dipping?\n\n* Chicken Tenders \"Chicken tenders in crisp tempura with a side of our own honey mustard.\" $7.95 - It really is the tempura batter that makes these tenders pretty delicious!  The Big F really enjoyed these treats!\n\n* Chicken Boxty Quesadillas \"Our signature boxty potato pancake is richly layered with grilled chicken, melted pepper jack cheese and drizzled with a red chili aioli.  Tomato pico and sour cream on the side.\" $9.95 - Quesadillas that are yummy with the potato pancake mix.  Good stuff.\n\nAnd if you don't know what a boxty is, \"Associated with rural sections of Ireland, the traditional Boxty is a gently seasoned potato pancake filled with special ingredients and cooked on a griddle.\"\n\nWith it being a Thursday, it's Trivia Night!  This turned out to be quite a fun event, despite us having to bail early.  Gift certificate prizes are up for grabs and you can work in teams.  Although the games reminded me of weakness with trivia, I had a pretty good time with good company in hand.\n\nAdditional appetizers we got to try included:\n\n* Corned Beef Rolls \"Tender corned beef and creamy mustard sauce tightly rolled inside a traditional boxty topped with a cabbage salad.\" $6.75 - Corned beef and cabbage put together into the perfect bite size portions.  They do this really well!\n\n* Smoked Salmon Bites \"Traditional cold-smoked, oak salmon on crisp boxty \"blini\" with capers, onions and a light horseradish sauce.\" $8.95 - Another bite-size treat that is pretty good stuff.\n\nOverall, Fado's is a pretty big pub with an upstairs area too.  A relaxed atmosphere with an interesting mix of people.  My only complaint was that a waitress forgot to bring a menu at one point, and then forgot a drink later on.

There's seating available at the sushi bar, the tables, and even tatami rooms!  The menus are quite extensive and you have to spend a great deal of time doing the matching game.  One menu offers the happy hour specials, but in order to find out what's in each roll, you have to read through their regular menu.  It takes a good while!  A large selection of rolls and thank goodness for pictures.  They all start to sound the same though and many of them overlap.  They also offer this Buy 10 Get One Free from their special roll menu.    You can also do Shabu Shabu, Sukiyaki, or Yosenabe here if you'd like!  \n\nWe finally decided on a few things from their happy hour menu, and surprisingly, we didn't end up with much sushi!  \n\n777 Roll ($9.95 HH price, $12.95 reg.) - \"Shrimp, scallop, miki, tobiko, cream cheese; topped with avocado, albacore and served with garlic and yumyum sauce.\"  It's a pretty good roll, but fatty as hell because that yumyum sauce is a mayonnaise-based sauce.  You can tell how bad it is for you once you take the first bite!  \n\nDeep Fried Tofu ($3.50 HH price, $4.95 reg.) - Also known as Agedashi tofu.  It was a bit tough, not easy to break apart.  I prefer my agedashi a little softer so my spoon can gently cut into it.\n\nTonkatsu ($3.50 HH price) - I'm not a particular big fan of the pork cutlet, but the BF is.  He thought it was pretty good and such a great value that he ordered another!\n\nShishamo ($2.80 HH price, $3.80 reg.) - Grilled smelt fish with smelt eggs - it was okay here.  I've had better.  A bit tough and on the smaller end.\n\nOsaka Rice ($4.95 HH price, $6.95 reg.) - \"Mixture of sushi rice, crab, masago, yum yum sauce, sesame oil and siracha sauce.\"  My friend was eating this as she's ordered it before.  It was okay, there wasn't enough taste going on for my preference.  \n\nSeafood Salad ($6.95 HH price, $14.95 reg.) - Lots more sunomono in it than I would have preferred.  I usually like my seafood salad to have a more seafood than anything else.\n\nIf you sit facing the sushi bar, they have a slide show on the computer screens with their different rolls and dishes presented.    \n\nOverall, the food here is a bit more expensive than other Japanese restaurants. They are obviously doing okay since this is their second location \n\nLate night happy hour is good until 1:45 am!

So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.\n\nWe decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\nI dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.\n\nWhen I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.\n\nFor this experience, I give it a TWO stars.\n\nOverall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.

Mi Bo Kho \"Beef Stew with Egg Noodles\" ($6.95) - The Husband was impressed with their version of one of his favorite dishes.\n\nService was good too - tea comes out automatically, unlike some other restaurants we frequent and they are quick to take your order.  Food comes out promptly too.\n\nWithin the past week, I've been back twice for this:\n\n* 85. Bo Tom Muc Nhung Dam \"Beef, Shrimp and Squid dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce\" ($25.95) - A platter of raw beef, shrimp, and squid and a pot of hot vinegar broth are presented before you, along with a plate of veggies (various greens, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and pickled daikon and carrots), a plate of rice noodles, rice paper, and a bowl of hot water.  For you first timers, you dip the rice paper in the hot water to get it soft, then you start to load it up with veggies, rice noodle and whatever you cooked up in the hot vinegary broth.  And of course, be sure to dip it in the tasty pineappley sauce thing they give you.  Oh so good!  It's another way for  me to enjoy hot pot - but Vietnamese-style!\n\nLast night we had this one:\n* 84B. Bo Tom Nhung Dam \"Beef & Shrimp dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce\" ($23.95) - Same thing, but without the squid.  I just love it because it's light, and you can ask for more veggies and rice paper if necessary.  That dipping sauce has a sweet and sour quick with a fruity twist and just good!\n\n* 89. Bo Luc Lac \"Diced Beef Salad\" ($9.50) - This was a semi-raw beef dish with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, limes, and peanuts.  Be sure to dip this in the fish sauce too for that extra tangy bite!  Yum!\n\nThere are a bunch of other items in their Special Dishes section that I'm anxious to try.  It's a generous amount of food though, so it's better to go with a group of at least three.

And those that had been around for awhile, it appeared that they were getting a new surge of customers.  I was damn curious to see what the hype was all about and with a restaurant named \"Tofu Hut\", I figure it would satisfy my curiosity.  We actually passed another Korean restaurant first, a new one complete with the \"Grand Opening\" sign up.  I figure we'd try out \"Tofu Hut\" since it had been in Vegas for awhile and has lasted.  Usually, it's a sign that the business must be doing alright, right?  Wrong.\n\nSo, my first mistake was assuming that because it had been in Vegas for awhile, it would be decent.  The second mistake I made was not checking Yelp first to see if anyone had anything about this restaurant.  If I had done this first, I would have seen TWO 1 star reviews with no other good reviews to counteract the two.  If I had done this research first, you would not have seen me eating here.\n\nWalking in for an early Sunday evening dinner, our party of four chose the cooking table with the plan to cook some serious meat.  Instead, we ordered the Kimchee Beef Tofu Soup ($8.36), two orders of Short Ribs BBQ ($12.59 each), and a Kimchee Pot Stew ($8.95).  If you do want to do the table barbecue, it's a minimum two orders to do that.\n\nThey brought out a side salad for each person to start and then five banchan (side dishes) to share.  And yes, I said five.  I thought this was a joke - April Fools' Day, haha kind of joke.  No.  I know at some Korean restaurants they give out more banchan to the Koreans, so we even asked for more and they said that's all they had. I thought we were being gypped and looked over at the neighboring table of six Koreans to see if they got more than we did.  No, they did not.  Tofu Hut only gives out five banchan!  Blah!  They were this coleslaw concoction that I have never seen before, cabbage kimchee, fishcake, bean sprouts, and cucumbers.  I'm used to getting 5-10 banchans, you can imagine my shock and disappointment!\n\nWhen the tofu soup and pot stew arrived, the waitress asked if she wanted her to crack a fresh egg in there.  Sure!  As she passed over my hot tofu soup, she knocked over the BF's water glass.  No big deal, she apologized and cleaned it up.  (I was just glad she didn't drop the hot soup too!)  I had my tofu \"spicy\" and it was more mild.  There wasn't much taste going on here and I was less than impressed.  I did like the hot stone burnt rice that comes out with my tofu soup though.  My friend's pot stew was more soup-like than she cared for as well.  The only thing really good was the Short Ribs.  We ended up ordering another plate because it was pretty good.  Everything else fell below par.  \n\nTo close out our meal, the check came.  We asked if they had shikhye, which is a this cold beverage that is usually served at the end of the meal.  It's refreshing after a greasy meal and I'm used to getting this automatically after our meal concludes at Korean restaurants.  They told us they did not have this.  Oh my goodness.  Five banchans and no shikhye?!  \n\nFinal bill: $70 including tip and tax.\n\nThis restaurant is sparse.

It also comes with the standard two scoops of white rice and one scoop of mac salad.  \n\nI should mention, I've been to my share of Hawaiian joints, but my sister takes the cake.  She definitely makes it a point to try out any new ones that she comes across.  She also always substitutes the two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad for an additional scoop of mac and one less rice.  This is usually never a problem, and if anything, they might charge a bit more for the mac salad.  Well, I asked if I could do this.  The cashier had to ask another woman, and she in turn had to ask another guy (the manager/owner) I assume.  He flat out said no.  Wow.  They tried explaining something about not charging me for the rice, so they can't do that.  Anyway, I think I was just put off with the whole \"No.\" answer.  They could have said yes and said they would charge me for the substitution, which I probably would have agreed to anyway.  \n\nWe got our number, helped ourselves to beverages and condiments and took a seat in a booth.  One of the servers soon headed our way with my order.  Just as she was about to place it on the table, all this liquid came spilling out onto the floor and table from the plate.  (Wtf?)  She apologized and went to retrieve a towel to clean up the mess.  I was fine with the spill and clean up, my concern was with where all the liquid came from?!  I guess my Pork Lau Lau must have come out a bath, because that was dripping wet.  I ended up  pouring all this additional liquid off my plate into another plate before my rice and mac salad got too soggy from all this 'juice' sitting on my dish.  I unraveled my lau lau in search of my pork and took my first bite.  For being soggy, the meat was rather tough and the whole dish had no taste.  I ended up pouring tons of shoyu all over the dish.  There was no fatty bits either to give it any flavor.  Very disappointing on the pork lau lau part.  The kalua pig faired a bit better, but not by much.  It started out well, but as I got deeper into it, there was a lot of tough pieces that I ended up spitting out.  Overall, my dish was pretty disappointing.  I wouldn't go back here for any pork lau lau at all.\n\nI was about halfway through my order before the BF's order finally arrived.  (This is never a good thing.)  His was better, in his opinion.  He had a decent experience with his order at least.  The Chicken Teriyaki had a sweeter sauce than what I'm used to, but that's probably why this dish does well here. \n\nThe mac salad was better than some of the other places I've been to, so that was a good thing.  \n\nThere's the Aloha Bar next door and there's karaoke on Friday nights.  You'll see the servers bringing orders in next door if you're dining in.  \n\nThey do offer delivery, it's a $10 minimum and if you get their flyer, you'll find a 15% coupon on there. I asked if they had any business cards, which they were out of.  When the cashier asked the manager/owner if he had any, he asked \"Why?\"  (Uh, 'cuz I'm going to yelp this place, that's why!)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Aloha Kitchen will continue to do well.  They are open later than some of the other Hawaiian establishments around town (5 am on Fridays and Saturdays I believe!) and they have a surplus of young customers coming in to chow down.  They have two other locations, one on E. Charleston and the other on S. Maryland Parkway.  I just know that if I return, I won't be getting any pork lau lau, that's for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RfR5yc4j9coIPBuxRsOW8Q"}

Charleston Boulevard.  A tiny sushi bar occupies the corner along with a flat screen TV.  With only one waitress and one sushi chef on a Friday night, they can easily handle the light crowd on a Friday night.\n\nUpon seating and getting our drink orders, the waitress automatically brings out miso soup.  A nice treat as you peruse the menu.  For dinner, I chose the Nozomi's Combination Dinner of three items.  For $16.95, I got tempura, pork katsu, and fried scallop.  Rice, a side salad, sunomono, and pickled daikon accompanied my order.  The BF went for the same - but his choices were the grilled saba, pork katsu, and the chicken katsu.  We were both impressed with the hearty amount of the food we got and both had leftovers to bring home surprisingly enough.  The fried scallops were juicy buggers, and some on the big side too!  (Other choices for the combination include chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, vegetable tempura, and fried oyster.)\n\nTheir menu not only includes your basic Japanese fare and sushi rolls, but also their Steak Joshua ($14.95) - \"New York steak seasoned with Hawaiian rock salt and grilled in garlic butter\" and their famous Chuckster Salad ($9.95 sm; $13.95 lg) - \"Assorted chunks of sashimi, sweet cucumbers, and daikon topped with tempura flakes and special sauce\".\n\nThey do offer all you can eat sushi for $25.99/pp as well.\n\nService was good, simple and efficient.  I got the impression they had regulars there from the way they didn't have to look at the menu to put their order in.  We expect to return again for a satisfying meal.\n\n(I uploaded our dinner pics in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ocZ8pz-8iSz5avdPKnoalA"}

The lunch came with one piece of shrimp tempura and three pieces of veggies, the beef and chicken, rice, pickled daikon, a side salad with creamy dressing and miso soup.  The beef and chicken were okay, heavy on the teriyaki sauce.  The tempura was just alright as well.  But the CA roll was pretty disappointing. I never order it, but it's been a long time since I've actually seen the kani sitting there in one piece.  (Nowadays they usually chop it up and mix it a little so it looks and tastes a lot better.)  \n\nFor $14.95, the Big F got the two combo lunch with chicken Katsu and fried scallops.  It also came with miso soup, pickled daikon, side salad, rice, and sunomono.  He remembered the fried scallops from before, which is why he ordered them again.  He was less than impressed this time around with his entire lunch.\n\nThere was only one official waitress working and maybe the lunch crowd filled up more this time.  But she was running around a lot and it wasn't until we were almost done did someone from the back come out and help her clean up the dirty tables.  \n\nOverall, our experience the first time was much better. The food just wasn't up to par.  We definitely wouldn't eat here again, especially without a coupon!   It's a pretty average Japanese restaurant.

(Craft stores sell them for way more than that!)\n\nI haven't ventured too far into the store past the scrapbook aisle though. When I do, it can look like a big chaotic mess.  \n\nCustomer service...now, that's a whole other issue.  First off, they are always understaffed.  The lines are just too long and they can never catch up or open enough registers when it's necessary.  Take today for example - the whole time I was there, they had only one register open.  However, there was always a wait and no one else bothered to open another register.  The manager isn't the nicest and she always seems stressed out.  But I guess I would be too working there.  One time I had an employee walk out in the middle of a transaction with me.  She began ringing me up, and then announced that she was leaving.  Other employees were in disbelief and weren't sure if she meant she was going on a break or leaving for the day.  (I think she just got fed up and left the job completely.  She got her things and logged out and was gone!)  \n\nThey do offer a Buzz Club rewards program where you get points every time you spend $20 or more.  But this program is far from incident - supposedly they can look you up by phone number or email.  However, they definitely weren't able to look me up in the past although they tried 'everything'.  Apparently, it wasn't linked up yet supposedly.  Today, their system was down so no points were earned.  They suggested that you bring your receipt in again so they'll credit it accordingly.  Just a tad inconvenient.\n\nOverall, I'll continue swinging by when I'm doing my grocery shopping at SF Super next door.

No tourists would be venturing out over here.  All that much better!  \n\nWhen looking at the bar and all the special menu items posted on the wall, it can be quite difficult when deciding what to order.  So, when in doubt, let the expert go at it.\n\nI fondly remember the fried smelt (less than $3 for three fish).  These plump babies are loaded up 'cuz their eggs are still sitting inside of them.  And with a little bit of salt and some fresh lemon juice, yum yum!  And who doesn't love ankimo?!  Monkfish liver that melts in your mouth...ahhhh...I love ankimo!  I've tried a bunch of other things there like the red snapper carpaccio with ikura, ramen noodles, the beef tataki w/ lemon juice, fresh oysters on the half shell w/ ponzu sauce (2 for $4.25), seaweed salad, and the beef cubes.  I don't remember anything bad about the place, but just good food with good company.\n\nThe first time I went, they had those fancy Japanese toilets with all those buttons to try out.  I attempted to use it but had no luck.  On my last visit, their special toilet was no longer there!  =(  I guess too many people were having way too much fun with it and it went into retirement.  \n\nIf possible, go with a large group and sit in the back where you have to take your shoes off to swing your feet under the table.  And this way, you can also order a lot more random things and share them with everyone.  It makes it all that much merrier.  Overall, pretty extensive menu...I think I want some of that fried smelt roe just about now!  Bring it!\n\nUpdated: 10/10/06 - They also offer a FREE membership card.  You get 5% off whenever you dine there when you bring this card and it eventually adds up to 10-15% off your bill for next time.\n\nI also like getting the Agedashi Tofu soup.  It's light and delicate without being overly infused with the bonito flakes.  Yum yum!\n\nThe salmon skin salad was okay.  The dressing overpowers the salmon skin, so you can't taste a whole lot.  I wouldn't bother getting it again.  \n\nThe deep fried crabs are a plate of baby crabs with an aioli type dipping sauce.  An interesting taste and a nice crunch! \n\nSide note: They give you a wet towelette thing and that will be your napkin for the entire meal.  Don't bother looking around for regular paper napkins here!\n\nUpdated: 11/27/06 - I recently tried the okra with natto (less than $3).  First off, the idea of natto grosses me out.  The texture alone is nasty, and the smell...geez, that's a whole other subject.  Since it was my dining partner's first time w/ the stuff, I suggested he give it a go at some a cheap price.  It comes with thin slices of fresh okra, seaweed slivers, and hot mustard on the side.  Overall, I would not recommend it unless you're a fan of this stuff.  I definitely am not one. Blah.  \n\nAlso, the last two times I went, they were out of the lovely ankimo!  Argh!\n\nUpdated: 01/24/07 - I changed my ratings from four stars to five because I find myself craving the fried smelt roe more often than not.  And Ichiza has apparently become my comfort restaurant to turn to when I can't decide where else to go.  I have only been to one other izakaya, and that was Musha in Torrance, CA.  How can this place not be special?\n\nUpdated: 06/12/07 - Went back the past weekend after a few month hiatus.  They were out of uni and ankimo!  Argh!  But we had the beef tongue - tasty, and gotta eat it when it's hot; minced spanish mackerel on cucumber - fresh, lots of flavors on your palatte, fried garlic - put salt on it instead of the miso, and oh-so good!, tartar yellowtail - with avocado, crisp things, and salsa - refreshing flavors and light, and honey toast - they need more bread chunks, but yummy!  (They had a few new dishes that were listed in Japanese.  If you ask the waitresses or owner to translate, they'll try their best!  Be daring and give it a go!)\n\nUpdate! 08/06/07 - Out of ankimo again!  Argh!  But they do have a soft shell crab appetizer that comes with a ponzu dipping sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.  It's a fatty crab with lots of meat!  Yum!  Their red snapper carpaccio is a bit different, it comes with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella!  \n\nUpdate! 10/09/07 - Where the heck is all the ankimo?!  Argh!  Brought some out-of-town guests to Ichiza to experience where the locals eat.  Ate all the standard stuff, of course.  New thing tried here - live scallop.  I warn you now, don't sniff the squiggly things...it may turn you off!  But the scallop slices dipped in ponzu sauce is oh so tasty.  Also shared a ramen bowl.  I'm personally not a big fan of ramen (it's a filler), so I'll pass on it.  Everyone else seemed to swallow it down without any problems! =)\n\n(I added some photos of my eats above!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "4UVhuOLaMm2-34SrW8y-ag"}

Not the most feng shui I'm sure, but make a right down the hall and you'll see another entrance which brings you right to the sushi bar.  I noted to the BF that this location was way smaller, and he then pointed out they had more room in the back.  We took a walk down there after eating to check out their tatami room (lots of space), semi-private booths, and a hibachi grill area too.  They are pretty fancy here with slide shows running on a computer screen at every booth in the back.  I would be even more impressed if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by pressing your selection.  That would be super high tech!  \n\nAnyway, back to the review and the food.  The menus are pretty much the same at both locations, for the most part.  From their late night happy hour menu, this is what we ordered:\n\n* Shishamo ($2.80) - It came with three pieces.  Again a bit tougher than what I'm used to.  They seasoned it with black pepper, but I asked for some salt to give it a little more kick too.\n\n* Korean-Style Spicy Chicken ($4.50) - It's literally stir-fried chicken with Korean spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce.  I wasn't sure if the lettuce was garnish or to eat.  Oh well, I ate it.\n\n* Crazy Horse Roll ($4.20) - It's tuna, salmon, masago and mixed together with spicy sauce.  It's a very basic roll, but pretty good.\n\n* Fire Roll ($3.90) - Crab meat and spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it looks like the CA rolls you buy from the supermarket, but without the avocado in it.  It had a bit of kick in it.\n\nAnd from their regular menu: \n\n* Ankimo ($6.95) - Monkfish liver...oh how I love this stuff.  It's an acquired taste.  I like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauce and then break off a tiny piece and savor each little morsel.  The BF likes to dunk his piece into the sauce and then toss the whole thing in his mouth.  He likes to then mush it around in his mouth.  Haha!\n\nThey are known for their exotic and colorful rolls, and they can be a bit a pricey.  It's our unfortunate luck that the only two rolls we ordered were so visually boring.  \n\nService: It wasn't too busy this late in the evening.  A handful of people at the bar and few people at the tables.  The BF had to ask for his soda to be refilled and the waitress never came back with his drink!  When he asked for it, the waitress got him another one.  Then a few minutes later, she came by and took his drink away!  (We were wondering why she did that.)  When she came back with his drink, she said she was refilling it again.  (I guess to make up for his drink disappearing in the first place.)  The BF asked for my own pot of tea since I'm a big tea drinker and to save them the trouble of having to refill my teacup every five seconds.\n\nOne waiter came by twice to take away dishes that we weren't done yet.  In the process, he would try to squeeze in between us to reach for the plate, only to realize there was still food on it.  And finally at the end of our meal when the plate was clearly empty, then he asked if he could take it!  We were amused.  And actually, when we are both done sharing a plate, we actually put it to the side to help them out for that reason - so they don't have to reach in between a couple of lovebirds.

It took us all awhile to order since we didn't know where to start.  After getting our orders in, we were able to get a deck of cards so we can be part of the crowd.  The BF and I shared a large Mango Snow Ice ($6.25) with no tapioca.  Good stuff, mostly because it tasted like mango puree.  Our other friends order the Chrysanthemum tea, which came with two tea cups, a medium Lychee Snow Ice with tapioca ($4.75), and a Iced Black Tea.  When ordering the black tea, the waiter asked if he wanted it hot or cold, and he opted for cold.  He didn't expect it to be sweetened though.  It ended up being okay in the end, but took him by surprise when he tasted the sweetness.\n\nTo grub on, we ordered Fried Spicy Chicken ($4.50) which is deep fried with basil.  The BF and I like to grub on this from various boba places that offer it.  We also tried the Fried Tofu ($4.50), which is pretty basic and comes with hot sauce.  But decent when you want fried junk.  We tried ordering the Taiwanese Pork Pacman ($6.50), but the waiter strongly discouraged us from ordering it.  We ended up with the Fried Squid Balls ($4.50), which is exactly what it is, squid balls!  (Not those kind of balls, duh!)  Food is pretty pricey when you look it over, but you're really here for their beverages.  They also serve random things like Chicken Alfredo Pasta ($7.50) and Squid Jerky ($4.50). \n\nThe cool thing about this place is that you can chill and hang out.  You can grab a deck of cards and just have a good time.  (Apparently we were having too much fun though 'cuz they told us to quiet down.)  You'll find people of all ethnic backgrounds here as well, which I always think is a cool thing.\n\nService is just okay.  They never cleared our table, so we had to put the plates on the shelf next to us.  We were there for a good couple of hours too and ordered throughout our stay, so that's probably why they allowed our loud selves to stick around.  \n\nOverall, I do like places that allow you to hang out and play cards.

Last night he went for the Swiss Crunch (swiss chocolate and crunch) and he was a bit surprised with what he got.  Nonetheless, the crunch was oh so good, and I think I have it figured out!

It's worth looking for though!\n\nUpdate! 09/17/07 - I've been to Luv-It a lot more times since writing this review!  And yes, a few times we've drove on by once we saw the 50+ people in line!  But the BF and I order only one thing - the vanilla custard with crunch topping.  We just can't say no to that honeycomb sweetness!  I've tried their lemon one with peanuts, and it was surprisingly not tart.  It had a nice sweetness to it!  I'll keep on bringing visitors to this place because it's definitely better than the chains out there (and I've tried a couple of those frozen custard places and they can't compare!).\n\nUpdate! 10/09/07 - Went back the past weekend and tried their blueberry flavor with crunch! (Yay for crunch!)  It tasted pretty grub, but then I had that yucky feeling happen...y'know, the one that tells your body that whatever you just ate isn't agreeing with you.  So, the BF had to rush me quickly to a casino to take care of business.  And it tasted so good though too!  It's a good thing that my previous experiences there have been positive and this was just an unlucky blow, otherwise I would have to knock down their star rating!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uYVdp5LfCbX8S8ytnhdk-g"}

(I actually called ahead to inquire about their cover charges and was told that it's free before 10 pm and $10 afterwards for local ladies.  What a crock of shit!)  And despite having a party of ten girls, we still couldn't get any discount!  Blah!  (They said it had to do with arriving in our own limo versus a taxi or some crap like that.)  \n\nAs we headed upstairs to watch the male strippers, it's hard to miss the signs saying there was a two drink minimum upstairs.  Lap dances are $20 each.  The cocktail waiter did his best trying to get us to do the bottle service, but it would have cost more for our group in the long run.\n\nAfter our drinks arrived, that's when the bulls start crowding.  It's as if they signal each other to attack all at once.  They pinpoint the bride and get lap dances on her right away.  All the other guys start finding out who the maid of honor is so she can get a side by side dance with the bride.  At this point, you're getting your first up close look at the dancers and you want to be picky before you have them gyrating against your body, right?  When the crowding finally stops, you can watch what's going on onstage.  Some dancers really do a good show while others could use some help.\n\nIn retrospect, it might be better to sit up by the stage with dollar bills in hand and tip the dancers as they do their thing in front of you.  You'll last a lot longer and get a little something extra. \n\nFor the $20 lap dance, sometimes you get something that is over the top and leaving you breathless while others leave you rather disappointed.  If anything, it might give your girlfriends something to laugh at.  Promises of \"I'm gonna fuck her up!\" were a common thread we heard throughout the night.  (Uh, the girl is getting married and I don't really want her all fucked up!  I just want her entertained!)\n\nKeep your eyes out for Chili who hangs on his own.  He doesn't show up with the bull crowd, but swings by later to actually talk to the ladies.  He's a smart businessman and is a bit more acrobatic than most.  You'll recognize him by the handstands he's doing on the little tables.\n\nWe arrived on a Friday night before 10 pm.  Things were slow then and picked up by midnight.  How much personal attention you want will depend on what time you arrive.\n\nOverall, OG was a disappointing experience.  Sure, some guys gave a good show while others were average.  We didn't hang out downstairs to check out the ladies, but I wish we did.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YZxA6w82eFJFntwqJLln6w"}

Upon entering, the waitress looked at us and then the clock.  I asked if they were closing and she said no, but we had five minutes to order.  (I guess the last seating is definitely at 8 pm.)\n\nWalking past the small market and into the back, we seated ourselves into a quaint little booth.  A bunch of older folks filled the other tables and you get the feeling that this is definitely a family kind of place.  (Hofbrauhaus and Cafe Heidelberg are in two totally different leagues.)\n\nThe waitress handed us the menus and a beverage list.  The food menu is very basic, nothing fancy at all.  And the beverage list has a decent variety of beers and wine.  \n\nI wanted spatzle, and that's all I cared about.  So I ordered one of the few things that came with spatzle - the Jagerschnitzel ($23), \"Pork schnitzel lightly battered and smothered in a mushroom , wine and onion sauce.  Paired with red cabbage and spatzel.\"\n\nThe BF was torn between the Mixed Wurst Plate ($23), \"Bratwurst, Knackwurst, and Bockwurst.  Served on a bed of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes,\" and the Oktoberfest Platter ($25), \"A classic pork schnitzel and a jumbo Bratwurst paired perfectly with red cabbage and homemade spatzle.\"  He chose the former since I already had the pork schnitzel and spatzle in my dish.\n\nAs we waited for our entrees, bread and butter arrived with our beverages.  We also took a little walk through the market to check out their German groceries and deli.  A limited choice of food items, but you'll find your herring, spatzel, and sauerkraut available here for home.\n\nMy pork schnitzel was covered with dark brown gravy and was quite tender.  Pretty good.  The spatzel was okay, but maybe it's because I prefer it with a creamier sauce instead, like mushroom.  (I think I should have ordered the Kase Spatzle ($16), \"House recipe German noodles smothered with melted Swiss cheese.  Garnished with tomatoes,\" instead.)  The red cabbage was blah, nothing special but the side salad was pretty tasty.  \n\nThe BF's wurst feast came with a side of mustard sauce for dipping and a huge helping of sauerkraut.  The different wursts were pretty good and the sauerkraut was okay.  (Then again, I think I'm a fan of it on the colder end and crunchy than soggy.)\n\nThey were both very generous orders and we had leftovers to go.  We never made it to dessert which was \"Bavarian Apple Strudel with vanilla sauce\" ($7) and \"Black Forest Cherry Cake\" ($5).  \n\nOverall, Cafe Heidelberg may probably be more authentic German fare than Hofbrauhaus.  They were recently voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" for \"Other Ethnic Restaurant\" again.  So, if you want your German fix, head on over to Cafe Heidelberg, just don't expect the loud music, crazy games, and the long wait of its competitor.\n\n(I added pics of our dinner in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "6S8VwQ22xdj7rOX00SceJg"}

A place that only served goat meat and nothing else?  Hmmm...\n\nIt's Friday evening and we called in to find out what time they closed.  9 pm we were told.  We rolled into the Commercial Center right before 8:30pm and excitedly walked in.  They were sweeping up and things didn't look promising.  They said we could only order to go now.  (Shute!)  \n\nNonetheless, having crawled out of bed just for this meal, we were not going to say no.  Initially expecting minimal, if any, English, the pleasant girl at the register told us there was only two things to order - chico or grande.  It was going to be either ribs or the hindquarters of the goat.  Oh well.  We got two orders of the stuff and headed out.  The goat meat was sitting in consomme, and limes, cilantro, chopped onions, and corn tortila were each wrapped separately.  \n\nOverall, the flavor of the meat was good.  It was crispy at some points, and soft and tender in other parts.  The whole thing was a bit messy and had our car smelling like onions and spices for a few days.  It was a good meal, but lacked a bit of a punch.  (We added some kick of our own when we brought it home.)\n\nI noticed they had a website and realized Birrieria Jalisco was actually their third store, the first two being in Southern California.  We felt a bit cheated, thinking this restaurant was unique on its own.  Nonetheless, we had to be impressed that a restaurant can do well on serving goat meat and nothing else.

They offered three cheeses - brie, blue, and morbier.  The morbier was absolutely delicious, but the blue was a bit too crumbly for my choice.  This is an excellent choice if you're ordering wine too.  (We had to pass, it was our first meal of the day.)  \n\nThe Lobster Avocado Croissant was stuffed with lots of lobster salad.  Very yummy, but I would have wanted a bit more avocado in my sandwich.  (It is called a Lobster Avocado Croissant after all.)  A side of Caesar salad accompanied this sandwich.  \n\nLast to arrive was the Bacchus Salad.  After already dining on the wine platter and the sandwich, we could have done without the salad.  My companion did enjoy the goat cheese croutons, but the salad was average.  \n\nThe great thing about this place is that you can go through their wine selection (they are a wine shop after all), pick a bottle of wine and enjoy that bottle with your meal.  (There's a $10 corkage fee.)  \n\nService was okay.  Our waiter was average.  He never bothered telling us the daily special or anything.  The waitress who took over his shift was much better and a lot more pleasant.  I could hear her interactions with the other diners was much more impressed with her customer service skills than our waiter.\n\nAnd of course, please sit outside when dining here, especially for lunch.  With a shaded area and a mist, it's not hot out and the view of the lake makes it a fabulous place to just sit, relax, eat, drink, and just immerse yourself in the company of your dining companion(s).\n\nIt can easily be a romantic spot if you let it be, or go with friends and enjoy a couple of glasses of wine.

It gets a bit crowded by the front because people are waiting to be seated while other people wait to pay.  (Note: You pay at the register after your meal, so don't wait around at your table for the check 'cuz you won't get it.  Just remember your table number when you get to the register, otherwise you'll be one of those dorks who has to walk back to the table just to find out what your table number was.)\n\nI had a typical bowl of pho with everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Accompanied with it came the standard fresh bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, lemon, and jalapenos.  This place also provided some other leafy green to throw in, which is always a plus.  I don't mind the lemon, but sometimes I do like the lime in my soup though.  \n\nLike all typical pho places, all the tableware is on the table for you to help yourself with.  However, this place only provides a limited amount of napkins, not the whole napkin dispenser like some of my other favorite pho places.  I can be messy, and my nose is constantly dripping from all the sriracha sauce I use, so I like to have an endless supply of napkins available for my disposal.  \n\nOverall, a decent place.  Their menu is quite extensive, so you're bound to find something for everyone in here.  They even offer durian milkshakes, which is something you can't find or smell anywhere.  It gets crowded though, and to me, that's a good sign in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.\n\nUpdate: 04/23/07 - Went back and tried their Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($7.15), which is grilled chicken (or sliced pork) and egg rolls with steamed rice.  I replaced it with their French rice for a bit of variety.  I've been missing the five spice chicken rice plate from PPQ in San Francisco, so that's why I decided to try their version of chicken rice plate.  It was definitely disappointing!  No skin or much taste at all.  Service was blah, I had to ask for tea twice and it didn't show up until after my meal came.  By then, I didn't want my tea anymore.  I know not to try their chicken rice plate again.\n\nUpdate! 10/10/07 - Brought some out of town guests for some pho and this was our safest bet for them.  I ordered 18. Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet (Small $6.35).  One friend really enjoyed the soup here.  He said it had a lot more flavor than some of the other pho joints he's been to, mostly in the South Bay.  We also ordered the 7. Banh Xeo ($7.50), also known as a Vietnamese pancake.  The crepe was lighter and crispier than the one I had at Pho Hung Restaurant, but it wasn't loaded as much.  It came with a mountain of greenery to eat with your crepe too.  You can't complain that they are being skimpy on the fresh veggie stuff, that's for sure!  The BF ordered 37. Banh Mi Bo Kho ($7.00), which is beef stew served with a small baguette of French bread.  He likes to get this a lot at Vietnamese restaurants.

This is a rather large store though, so you need to take your time to absorb everything they sell.  This time around I got to really look at a few of the more unique items while the Husband focused on the Baby's convertible car seat.\n\nApparently, you can also create a Baby Registry with them!  Fancy that!\n\nWe'll be going back for sure, especially with those groupons on hand!  Definitely worth a visit to see what else there is beyond your typical chain baby store.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WyI-mrBSzVjLYu6OFlQBBA"}

Originating from San Francisco, finding a stellar dim sum restaurant in the desert will definitely be a challenge!  But I'm on it!\n\nCathay House was voted best dim sum in the local papers and received other accolades as noted on its wall.  I had high expectations!  \n\nIt was bustling on a Sunday afternoon and there was a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2.  Once seated in the main dining room, ice water, tea, and forks arrived immediately.  (Forks?)  Okay, so there were chopsticks already on the table but I guess out here, they are used to people asking for forks.  \n\nThere wasn't a huge variety of dim sum dishes to choose from, so that was already disappointing.  I did try the chicken feet in black bean sauce.  This dish lacked the full flavor that I'm used to.  The standard shrimp dumpling (har gow) and pork dumpling (shumai) were basic, if anything.  The salt and pepper shrimp had been sitting out too long after being stir-fried, not a good choice.  The beef rice noodle with a light soy sauce should be cut up to share a bit easier.  The crab claw puffs were average.\n\nI was anxious for the Shanghai dumplings, which they did not have.  Or the Shark Fin dumpling in soup with red vinegar and ginger slices to dip into.  Two of my favorites, and they were not available.  (And trust me, I did ask more than one employee for it.)\n\nLooking around for dessert, there were no egg custard tarts available or black sesame rolls.  I did see the sweet tofu, but that was about it.     \n\nThere were a lot of dishes that weren't being ordered, in other words...they looked stale as they passed our table numerous of times.  When you see the same cart pass you when you first sit down, and realize that the same dishes are still not moving on it an hour later, the turnover of food is not happening here.\n\nI also think it's odd that they serve dim sum until 10 pm.  In my opinion, a true tea house restaurant should only serve dim sum during brunch hours.  That is the whole point of \"drinking tea' aka yum cha or going for dim sum.  \n\nOverall, I don't plan on returning here unless I haven't found a better place yet.  My dining companion says this place WAS worthy of a three star in the past, but he had to change his review to a two now.  Sad sad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ"}

We both chose the side salad and definitely appreciate that it's a generous side salad, not those things you get from Wendy's! \n\nOverall, I was really pleased and the Husband was not.

A great way to spend the day when it's hitting over a hundred degrees!  It's about a forty-five minute drive from Phoenix.\n\nI went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.\n\nRentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.\n\nBring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)\n\nAnd yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)\n\nThey require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.\n\nIt's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!\n\nWe're on the lookout for more rivers to float on!", "type": "review", "business_id": "l3WML3zeuotwUHzhbwCj_w"}

He had tried earnestly to suggest another restaurant, but it appears that everyone else wanted their version of Hawaiian food from this place.\n\nWe ordered their special - the Hawaiian special lunch plate of pork lau lau, mac salad, tuna poki, and beef (or tripe) stew.  We also added an order of spam musubi and two drinks.  Total - over $15!  WTF?\n\nWhenever I eat Hawaiian food outside of Hawai'i, I always go for the pork lau lau, so I've had my share of this specialty.  With a little shoyu, I took my first bite of the pork lau lau and looked at my friend.  He took a bite himself and knew exactly what I was thinking.  \"This is bad.\"  It was dry, flavorless, and ultimately, I think it was old.  In all fairness, I dug in deeper, aiming for the center and was equally disappointed.  Moving onto the mac salad, this was a shame too.  Again, tasteless.  There was no flavor whatsoever in this mac salad.  Moving onto the tuna poki.  There was chunks of low grade tuna sitting in a sauce.  It was okay, edible and had more flavor because of the marination.  But nothing to rave about.  Thank goodness for the beef stew and sauce.  The chunks of beef had flavor and we poured all of that over our rice.  The spam musubi could use some serious improvement too.  I think they are using the cheap version of seaweed, or maybe it was old.  I just know that when I get a spam musubi or make it myself, the seaweed is a lot tastier and fresher.  \n\nThe only good thing this time was the free refill on the drinks!  I still gave this place a two star because everyone else was happy with their order.  Then again, they had a chicken teriyaki bowl and it's really hard to mess that one up.\n\nIf you feel the need to be immersed in the Hawaiian theme and surround yourself with Hawaiians and Hawaiian stuff, take a walk on over there.  You'll pass by Lambert's Ice Cream, Ethel M Chocolates, and lots of people in Hawaiian garb.

We were seated promptly by the very friendly hostess after arriving late.  (We later discovered she was more than the hostess, she was upper management!)  We had high expectations going in.\n\nWe had requested a specific seating area and a specific waitress to give us the ultimate Andre experience.  We were slightly disappointed when Laurie wasn't our waitress after all.  \n\nAfter perusing the menu and debating between the tasting menu or going all out on appetizers, we decided on the latter.  When the waiter finally returned to take our order, we began by telling him our interest in the appetizers first.  He was quick to point out that we should really decide on our main entrees while we order our appetizers and was adamant about this, indicating he would return when we had made our final decision.  I was looking up at this man in disbelief.  Surely, he must have misunderstood us.  I then pointed out, \"Uh, we plan on ordering all the appetizers...\"  \"Oh.\"  \n\nAfter he took our order, my companion and I looked at each other in complete bewilderment.  We actually felt intimated to order due to his aggressiveness.  He was a bit pushy on the wine list, which was a bit challenging to order from since we were going to go through so many different flavors from the appetizers alone.\n\nCompliments of the chef, we began with a  cold butternut squash soup and a tapenade of some sort on a blini.  The soup was yummy, but served in a tiny bowl that was challenging to drink from.  My companion was impressed with the tapenade thing more so than I was.\n\nNext to arrive was the Caspian Sea Caviar, Golden Osestra served with buckwheat blinis and condiments (hard boiled egg yolks, egg whites, chives, sour green, capers, and red onions).  The caviar was lovely, but the blinis took away from the smooth taste.  We ended up ditching the blinis and using the french bread that had arrived earlier.  We asked the waiter if they had crackers or some other bread for the caviar, but could not come up with anything else.  We found that the french bread did not take away from the extravagance of the caviar.\n\nNext to arrive was the Scandinavian Smoked Salmon and Caviar Parfait, Creamy Lemon-Dill Dressing and Horseradish Cream ($16).  Can I say yum?  The combination of flavors going on was absolutely wonderful to the palate.  There were so many layers going on and it was such a joy to eat.\n\nNext was the Tuna Tartare on Eggplant Caviar with Green Tomato Brunoise and Lavendar Sesame Seed Toast ($13).  The tuna was good, a bit average.  The tomatoes were okay with the tuna, but not particularly tasty on its own.\n\nAn Heirloom Tomato and Jumbo Lump Crab Salad with a Ginger Sorbet and Red Onion Vinaigrette ($17) graced our table next.  This was such a light and refreshing salad.  The sorbet was a fabulous touch and really pulled the dish together.  You felt good after eating this.\n\nMoving onto the warmer dishes, our Cauliflower Soup with Duck Confit arrived.  I normally would not have chosen such a soup, but was surprised with the flavors they were able to create in what is usually a pretty bland vegetable. The buttery toasted bits on the top were a lovely accent, but the real surprise came when we discovered the duck in the bottom of the bowl. Salty, but very yummy with the soup.\n\nThe most disappointing dish of all - Lobster Sausage with Spicy Crayfish Sauce and Fleuron ($15).  It was mushy and I could not be bothered.  We learned this was one of their more popular appetizers, but this was left untouched by us.\n\nThe Jumbo Sea Scallops wrapped in a Macadamia Nut Crust with Citrus Beurre Blanc and Mango Chutney ($15) came next.  They were light and tasty, but I think I felt a bit burned out by now with our hot apps.\n\nWe still had the Escargots de Bourgogne ($13) coming.  Six snails simmering in butter and herbs were laid in front of us.  I was reminded of the garlic and parsley taste from the Gordon Biersch's Garlic fries.  I wasn't so impressed with this dish.\n\nWe had been waiting for this dish all evening - Foie Gras from their daily special menu.  The savory taste of the foie gras with the sweetness of the bread underneath was not a pleasant combination.  This was also combined with  a sweet sauce and pine nuts.  Although the foie gras itself was good, it was far from spectacular.  \n\nTo close our meal, the Sauteed Veal Sweetbreads Provencale with Egg Yolk and Ricotta Cheese Filled Ravioli ($17) came.  The ravioli tasted quite plain to me, flavorless.  And the sweetbreads were nothing to rave about.\n\nWe never made it to dessert.\n\nIn such fine establishments, I usually expect the waiters to wait until all the  diners are seated before putting our plates down in front of us.  This was not the case for us.  It was a bit awkward to have our food sitting there as I waited for my companion to return.  \n\nA bit noisy.\n\nValet parking.\n\nPics above!", "type": "review", "business_id": "a3HmtiW3WzUvKxWy9Fezkg"}

After looking through their menu, it left us with very few choices.  (Their specialty is seafood, so the majority of the menu had some kind of seafood in it.)

The Big F thought the beef stew was different, and liked it a lot.  His plate was licked clean.\n\nI tried their Fajitas de Res ($14.95) \"beef fajitas\" - It came with either corn or flour tortillas, and I chose the flour kind.  Chunky pieces of beef with red and green bell peppers, onions, and some other red vegetable.  It was a pretty filling dish, and I had enough for leftovers.

Chang's is a smaller venue compared to Orchids Garden over on W. Sahara.\n\nArriving in the middle of the Saturday lunch rush, I was seated immediately, even without my party of four present.  The table set up was a bit awkward and I found myself rearranging the chairs and place settings before the rest of my dining companions arrived.\n\nThe dim sum carts came rolling by and I do admit, they had a better selection than Orchids.  We immediately got the shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings.  We also ordered a few random dumplings in a more translucent type skin, similar to the shrimp dumpling skin.  The chicken in the black bean sauce was a bit drier than other places, and not as flavorful.  We tried mushroom on tofu that was tasty and had the beef rice noodle and shrimp rice noodle.  Both the BF and the cousin enjoyed their Soft Tofu, which was sweeter here than other places.\n\nI think we were impressed by their wider selection that we forgot to inquire about the elusive Shanghai dumplings or Shark Fin Dumpling Soup!  Next time for sure!\n\nI was craving some sweetness to close out my meal and had the Egg Custard Tarts.  They had three small tarts to an order and they just came out of the oven!  These were definitely yummy!  I would go back just for these!  They had the Pineapple Bun, but not the kind with Egg Custard inside.  Bummer.\n\nService was okay.  Because the busboys are a bit overanxious to clear your table, they will consolidate your dishes for you. This is something I have always hated, unless it was necessary to do so.  I don't particularly enjoy watching the busboy bang the steamer against another steamer on your table so the lone pork dumpling will join the other lone shrimp dumpling just to have one less dish on the table.  I mean, for gawd's sake, are they short on dishes in the back?\n\nOverall, despite the lipstick mark found on the BF's water glass, I would give Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine a solid 3.5 stars.  They have a decent selection of dim sum choices, but could fair better on service and quality.  So far, they match up pretty competitively with Orchids for now.  But the search continues on to find a place that offers a wider selection and yummy tasty morsels of dim sum to satisfy this SF girl.\n\nTotal bill: $40 and change, not including tip.\n\nUpdate! 10/26/07 - Recently hosted a dinner here for about 40 people in one of their private rooms.  There were some people that were really easy to work with and friendly, while there were a few others that could be a bit abrasive.\n\nOur menu:\n* Seafood Chowder soup - Pretty good. I have this soup a lot, but I never knew it went by this name.  Chunks of seafood and tofu in a thick broth.  \n* Peking Duck ($32) - The skin is separated on another plate so you can start using them with the twelve buns provided.  Then the duck meat comes along on a different plate.\n* Walnut Prawns ($13.95) - Jumbo shrimp with candied walnuts on a bed of broccoli.  Beautifully presented and eaten all up!\n* Mongolian Beef ($8.95) - Not a particular favorite of mine, but eaten up by my fellow diners.\n* Steamed Chicken, Country Style (half $11.95) - I like steamed chicken, but the chicken head can be a bit of a distraction for those who maybe shocked by it.  Light flavoring and with a little white pepper, yum!\n* Fish Filet with Blackbean Sauce ($9.95) - A fave by someone else, but it was okay for me.  I prefer my fish steamed instead of stir-fried.\n* Baked Pork Cutlet with Seasoned Salt ($9.95) - Tasty, but it looked like we got all the little bits while the other tables got the large pieces of pork.\n* Stringbean Szechuan Style ($8.95) - I prefer my stringbeans braised, or double fried.  This was pretty standard, nothing special.\n* Chang's Crispy Fried Noodle ($9.95) - HUGE order and loaded with veggies and seafood bits.  A good value for the money!\n\nService wise - The food came too fast.  With so many orders coming out, our guests barely had a chance to make a dent into one dish before another dish would come.  There was never enough room on the table, and it would be nice if the waitstaff assisted with condensing the dishes onto smaller one (instead of just pouring them together).  They probably should work better as a team to make sure there is room on each lazy susan before coming out with each platter.  They were better at refilling water, tea, and rice pots in the beginning of the meal, but slacked off near the end.  They did bring us a knife to cut the cake (and offered to cut it for us too), extra napkins, to go boxes, etc.  Some polishing up on customer service overall could definitely use some improvement.  \n\nOverall, Chang's worked out well for our dinner party.  They were easy to work with in making our own menu and providing suggestions.  We also came early to decorate the room, which worked out well too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg"}

But I was wrong!  A little before 1 and there was still a stream of leisurely dim sum eaters enjoying their lunch and reading the newspaper.  (This was definitely a good sign since many of the customers were reading the Chinese language newspaper!)\n\nMost importantly, tea was brought out to us before the food came.  Nonetheless, the dim sum cart ladies were more than happy to surround us once we were seated.  I did ask for them to give us a moment as we were waiting for the rest of our party (in Cantonese) and they were more than happy to oblige in a polite manner.\n\nAmong the offerings, this is what we got:\n\n* Shrimp Dumplings\n* Pork Dumplings\n* Shanghai Dumplings\n* Peanut and Chive Dumplings\n* Tofu Skin Roll\n* Steamed Tripe\n* Pork Spare Ribs\n* Beef Rice Noodle Roll\n* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce - The first few carts didn't have this, but they were sure to let the kitchen know it was requested.  And the best part, they brought it to our table first when it did come out.  And that's how a dim sum restaurant should work!\n\nOur favorite - Egg Custard Pineapple Bun!  It was so creamy good, delicious and piping hot!  Look out for the ladies holding it on a tray because that means it just came out of the oven and it's definitely not something you want to miss!  (The Husband and I were still thinking about them later on in the day!)\n\nPrices for dim sum are:\n\nSmall, A group: $1.85\nMedium, B group: $2.50\nLarge, C group: $3.75\nD group: $5\nE group: $6.75\n(Seven of the things we ordered was part of the B group, with three items being in the A group, and one item in the C group.)\n\nSure, they can really invest in updating their sign outside since it's fading so bad.  And one dim sum cart lady was a bit pushy, in a humorous way, as she joked with me in my poor Cantonese.  But once I ordered a dish from her cart, she was gone.  Empty dishes were cleared in a quick manner, maybe still a bit too efficient but workable.\n\nAnd they do have hot chili oil!  They will automatically bring out hot chili sauce, but let them know you want the oil and out it will come!\n\n$36 for party of three, tip and tax included\n\nUpdate! (05.12.10)\n\nI just went yesterday for dim sum and they were still pretty where we had to wait for a short while for our party of four.  \n\nThey apparently ran out of hot chili oil!  Argh!  So, we were stuck with the regular hot chili sauce. Bleh.  \n\n$40 for a party of four, tip not included.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg"}

Yay, they got rid of that faded old sign advertising Chang's.  Although I'm not particularly fond of their tacky new font, at least it's legible! \n\nLooks like prices have gone up too!\n\nGroup A - $2\nGroup B - $2.75\nGroup C - $3.95 \nGroup D - $5.95\nGroup E - $7.95\n\nFor our hungry party of three, we had five items from Group A, seven items from Group B, and one item from Group C.\n\nThey included:\n\n* Shrimp Dumplings\n* Pork Dumplings\n* Beef Ball\n* Tofu Skin Roll\n* Steamed Tripe\n* Beef Rice Noodle Roll\n* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce \n* Deep Fried Ground Pork Dumpling\n* Deep Fried Taro and Ground Pork Dumpling\n* Shanghai Dumplings (Group C) - It's something they don't push around in the carts.  You have to put in a special order for it.  Our order was had four dumplings, but you can request eight.  It came out piping hot - just the way it's supposed to be.  Be careful with the soup inside because it burned my tongue! \n\nThe whole point of going out for dim sum is to \"yum cha\" which means to drink tea. Therefore, tea charges is as follows:\n\n* Tea is $.50/person\n* Chrysanthemum tea is $1/per person\n\nI wanted to end our lunch with something sweet and looked over the Egg Custard Tarts.  They appeared to be the same ones that were out when we first arrived, so I passed on that.  We also skipped on the Egg Custard Pineapple Bun this time around since we didn't see them come out fresh, and these buns needed to be eaten piping hot only!  They did offer the dessert tofu dish, but that's not my favorite.  Perhaps they need a better sweet selection or at least a higher turnover on it so things can still come out fresh! \n\nThe service was surprisingly attentive on a Monday and there was no wait.  Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly refilled without us asking, which we really appreciated.  A large bus group did arrive shortly after us and did take up some of the attention, but it was understandable.\n\nUnfortunately, they do not have hot chili oil anymore, just the regular hot chili sauce.  I'll continue to ask for it in case they bring it back!\n\n3.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg"}

So, bring it on! \n\nI remember getting a complimentary  Firefly*fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) to start of our meal - anything complimentary is ALWAYS appreciated!  Some of the tapas we ordered included Stuffed dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) $4,  Patatas bravas (roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli) $4.50, and some kind of meat tapa.

I was, uh *ahem*, recovering still and couldn't enjoy the various goodies that arrived at our table.\n\nBut I would definitely give it another go because I usually love tapas and I'm confident that if I was in my healthy state, this place would rate higher.\n\nUpdate! 02/26/07 - I finally got around to trying this place out again, and this time I was healthy and hungry!  It's Friday night and packed!  With an hour and half wait, we wing it outside under the heating lamps.  They started us off with bread, some type of buttery spread, and olives.  We ordered the ceviche of shrimp, which was tiger shrimp, avocado, and two corn tortilla chips ($8.50).  The ceviche was good, not sure how much shrimp was actually in the dish though and only two chips?  The roasted eggplant cannelloni, made with goat cheese and tomato sauce ($5.00) was a surprise hit.  It came in a set of three and the BF definitely plans on ordering this one again.  Tasty, especially if you're a goat cheese lover.  We order the lamb chops medium, and they came a bit overcooked.  With two chops, a red wine reduction, and sauteed lentils and veggies ($8.50), you got a bit more bang for your buck.  The baked filets of grouper that are marinated with herbs, lemon and garlic ($6.50) came with three pieces and lacked flavor.  I ended up using the sauce from my ceviche to give it a kick.  The pulpo asado, which is marinated and grilled octopus with a few red potatoes and chopped tomatoes ($7.50) was okay too.  We finished off with the BF's favorite - Banana-Nutella Sandwiches ($5.00).  This came with four triangles and you're supposed to dip it into the Nutella sauce.  The sauce was cold when we got it, but the BF claims it's usually served warm.  With a party of four, we shared a pitcher of their passion fruit Mojitos ($7.00/glass; $28.00/pitcher) that was pretty yummy.  (I love mojitos!)\n\nOverall, the food was okay.  We couldn't enjoy their meat dishes as much b/c our company was doing the \"No Meat Friday\" thing.  I'm upping my star rating from a three to a four because the atmosphere is good, and with tapas, everyone seems to have a good time.

Next to arrive was the Stuffed Red Peppers, \"roasted sweet red peppers, stuffed with Bulgarian feta cheese and fresh spices\" ($7.25).  Presentationally, it looked like something was missing on our plate.  The three peppers were very tasty though and was the highlight of our meal.  Our third dish was the Filet, which was thin slices of meat ($6.50).  This was pretty disappointing as it just tasted like ham, nothing special.  Fourth to come was the Cheese Shopsky Style ($5.95).  On top laid a fried egg that you mix in with the cheese.  It's a heavy dish that goes better with some bread.  Last to arrive was the Kebapcheta, \"grilled Bulgarian spiced sausages\" ($8.25).

They said they did.  So off to the strip we were headed to fill my belly with this yummy stuff.  \n\nFirst off, you got to love a menu with Japanese and English on it.  (I mean, do they really have that many Japanese people eating there?  Yes they do!  The waitresses are all Japanese and so are the sushi chefs!)  Their menu also has pictures to help you out, so that makes it all that much more easier.\n\nWe ordered the Tsukemen, which was an order of ramen noodles and another bowl of soup with tofu, pork, hard boiled egg, etc.  Usually, most ramen places combine this stuff into one heaping bowl for you, but they separate it out for you here.  \n\nWe also ordered their special Uni Ikura Rice Bowl, with was a layer of rice slathered with Uni and then topped with Ikura.  Sprinkles of seaweed flakes and sesame seeds rounded out this dish.  I am usually not an Uni fan and will never order the stuff.  But I decided to give it another try and it was way creamy and yummy.  My friend was forced to share this lovely concoction with me! Haha!  This also came with a bowl of miso soup.  Although noted on the wall that this order was $15.95, we were charged only $9.95.  We're not sure if this was a mistake on their part, or if this was their lunch price.  \n\nMy only complaint really was their version of what they said was Agedashi Tofu.  It really was deep fried tofu covered in a thick gravy sauce, not what I had in mind.  This version is what I can get in a Chinese restaurant, and I was looking for something a bit lighter.  So, you won't find me ordering this again.  \n\nThey also played an LV local radio station and got a fan out of me.  With two TVs going on, there can be a lot of distractions though.  \n\nAnother little perk is their little market right when you walk in.  They sell anything from rice, to tempura batter, to fresh veggies or Japanese snacks.

The yam stuff was a slimy white mess that reminded me of something else that should not be consumed on rice with tuna.  Yuck yuck yuck!  I'm not changing my stars though because it's because of them that I'm a converted Uni lover!  *sigh*\n\nUpdate! 04/01/07 - They changed their menus...which means their prices went up.

Kitfo \"Chopped lean beef seasoned with butter and mitmita.  Served with injera and ayb (cottage cheese), prepared to desire: raw, labilb - medium or well done.\" ($9) - We ordered this raw, of course.

It was a generous portion that she poured out on three sections of the injera bread.  It was my favorite out of everything else we ate.\n\n* #5. Yebeg Alicha \"Mild lamb stew, delicately seasoned and cooked with spiced garlic, ginger and other house spices.\" ($9) - We went for a meat stew this time, and chose this one because it was 'wetter' per the waitress.  It came with two chunks of lamb, more like goat, and a few other pieces.  It was a bit gamey-tasting and wasn't my particular favorite.  The Husband said he probably wouldn't order it again because it wasn't that special.\n\n* #11. Yetsom Migb \"Vegetarian combination with fish and split lentil.\" ($9)  On the menu, it's a misprint, so there's really no fish in this veggie combo.  What is included is the salad, red lentils, green lentils, yellow beans, steamed potatoes, cabbage and carrots, and collared greens.  I was a bit disappointed because usually we love the lentils and the spices they use in it.  This time it lacked a little something.  It was okay, but we actually had leftovers for once.  It didn't have the same explosion of flavors like the other Ethiopian restaurants we've been to.\n\nService was okay, as there was only one waitress when we first arrived.  She was very sweet, although a bit over-efficient with wiping down our table and taking our water glasses before we left the table.  We did try to inquire about any Ethiopian coffee since we saw the cups laid out near the TV, but the waitress pointed to the coffee maker they had behind the bar. We didn't see any kind of Ethiopian coffee ceremony listed on the menu either, so we figured they didn't offer it.\n\nOverall, it's a decent restaurant for Ethiopian food for what we had.

Lots of Indians were already dining and we took this as a good sign...and then we saw the buffet table set up.  Hmmm...we were hoping for an a la carte menu.  Unfortunately, they only had the buffet option available and so we were stuck with that.  \n\nWe ordered Mango Lassi to drink and that was a highlight.  Then we all loaded up for the buffet line.  Gandhi's offers a mix of North and South Indian cuisines and I was disappointed with pretty much everything available.  I usually want Indian food when I desire lots of rich spices and tastes going on, and all th dishes simmering away lacked any full or individual flavors.  There was no spice, no heat, nothing that stood out! Blah!  \n\nThey offered mint-cilantro sauce, but no pappadoms!  Argh.  I love pappadoms and they didn't have any!  I was already disappointed!  I love naan bread in general, but usually try the garlic or onion kinds, or whatever else is offered.  Not at this place, they just had plain naan bread that lacked any real flavor.  Everything had potatoes in it, too much potatoes if any.\n\nOne of my dining companions felt that she didn't eat her money's worth and went back for dessert - the mango/condensed milk dessert with fruit cocktail.

I guess it's a sign when an Indian restaurant starts out with an a la carte menu, then ditches it completely to go for the buffet thing, it means hard times.  They are strapped and desperate for business.  Too bad I won't be that desperate enough to come here again unless I'm dragged.  Yeah, for the price of less than $17/pp, you get more bang for your buck this way, but that's not why I came to Gandhi's to eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JSuzEURjXIr0G8WrECZIoA"}

Served in a sourdough bowl.\" for $7.25 and the Nascar Burger, \"a classic Black Angus 10 oz juicy flame-broiled burger.\" for $9.25.\n\nFirst off, the spinach & artichoke dip were tasty, but too small of a portion for the price.  And I wasn't too fond of the soft sourdough bowl - what's up with soft bread?  On the menu, it says, \"place in the center of the table and dive in!\"  Well, it's definitely not big enough to share.\n\nWe asked for the burger to be medium well, but it came out more well done.  There's a problem when you can't even get the burger right.  It had a decent flavor it in though, and it was also on a soft bun too.  The fries had a deep color that reminded me of Arby's curly fries, but without the seasoning.  \n\nService was a bit slow, not on our waitress's part, but on how long it took for the food to come out.  (Were they killing the cow in the back?)  The place needs some better lighting, maybe they are trying to save on the electric bill because I found it to be too dark for my tastes during the day.\n\nOverall, spend your money elsewhere.

Since his last visit, the decor has changed and looks a bit more updated as he said.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, with ramen being their most popular, a few rice dishes, appetizer plates, and some other entrees.  A few other menu items are posted on the walls.\n\nI got the Curry Rice \"curry sauce with vegetables and beef over rice\" for $7.95, which came with miso soup and a side salad.  The soup and salad arrived first, the soup was heavy with seaweed while the salad was shredded cabbage with a tangy vinaigrette.  When my curry rice arrived, I looked at my meal with disappointment.  It was an average amount, and the vegetables were only carrots and onions.  On top of the rice there was pickled ginger.  As I started to scoop out the sauce and rice onto another plate, I noticed there was no beef present.  I swam my spoon throughout the sauce and there was no beef to be found!  I double checked the menu to be sure it said beef and it did, so I waved the waiter over.  I asked if there was supposed to be beef in my dish and he nodded, and apologized and headed to the cook.  When he returned, I was afraid to see what he held in the small soy sauce dish.  Four pieces of cubed beef in curry sauce was what he placed in front of me, and that was just very sad indeed.  Sad for the beef being completely absent in my dish, and sad because of the sorry four pieces of beef cubes he then gave me.  In regards to taste, the curry sauce was fine, nothing special and not worth the price.\n\nThe Big F ordered the Cha-Shu Ramen \"soy based soup with EXTRA roasted pork\" for $9.25.  He was very hungry and the bowl presented in front of him was smaller than what we both had in mind.  He then remembered why he hadn't been back.  He was disappointed the last time and he was disappointed again. We probably could have gone to Yokohama Kaigenro and gotten more for our buck.  There were about four to six pieces of sliced pork in his dish, and I wasn't so sure about what made it so 'extra'.  \n\nOverall, we left hungry.  We finished our dinner and was disappointed with the quantity and quality of the food.  Sorry, Togoshi didn't do it for us and you won't see us back here again.\n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ep1kzTEks2qlTDiaRT5oJw"}

As we drove through the parking lot, we were stunned to see how busy it was.  The private lot was packed and we took the last parking space.  (There were still cars coming in as we walked into the restaurant.)  Could there be private event?\n\nAs I took a quick peek in, it didn't seem like it was closed for a party.  We took the last of the two tables available, which was our luck since the rest of our dinner there was a large group of people waiting.  Checking out our fellow diners, and we were surrounded by Indians and non-Indians.  This place was was ridiculously busy!  As a result, it took awhile to get our orders in and for our food to come.  It looked like a new restaurant inside with the simple decorations and complementing paint choices.  (As other yelper mentioned, they just renovated.)  A lone TV behind the bar showed Bollywood videos throughout the meal.  They also have two smaller rooms off to the sides.\n\nThe Husband and I both ordered a Mango Lassi \"Sweet yogurt based shake made with mango pulp.\" ($3.95) to start and it was probably one of the best I've had.  Presented in a copper cup, I would say they give you more than other places do.\n\nWe both chose a dinner special, which comes with chicken or dal soup; choice of bread - plain naan, garlic naan, or roti; basmatic rice and mango custard.\n\nThe Dal Soup \"A traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils.\" was simple, but tasty.  A nice start to our meal.\n\nThe Garlic Naan was a generous amount, and we actually had leftovers.  It was tasty with lots of garlic.\n\nMy Vegetable Dinner Special included \"Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, Dal Makhani, Raita\" ($19.95).  The Saag Paneer \"Creamy spicy spinach with chunks of homemade cheese.\" is usually a favorite of The Husband's, so I let him have most of it.  It was good, but not my favorite. The Navratan Korma \"Mixed veggies with cheese in a creamy sauce with cashews, almonds & raisins.\" was a favorite though, probably because I love creamy sauces in Indian cooking. The Dal Makhani \"Lentil delicacy flavored with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic & cream.\" was also very good as well, because I love lentils and cream!  The Raita \"Yogurt seasoned with cumin, cucumber, tomatoes & mint.\" has never been something I could enjoy, so The Husband enjoyed most of it.\n\nThe Husband went for the Rack of Lamb Dinner Special \"Rack of Lamb, Malai Kofta, Aloo Matar\" ($25.95).  The Malai Kofta \"Cheese & vegetable balls in an aromatic gravy.\" was a bit interesting, as we would say.  It's considered a \"House Favorite\" but it was just a bit weird for us.  The Aloo Matar \"Green peas cooked with diced potatoes and aromatic spices in a curry sauce.\" was yummy, as most Indian curry dishes are.  The rack of lamb was also good, and loaded with tons of onions and bell peppers, which The Husband ate up.\n\nThe Mango Custard was a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks of fruit in it.  Not exactly what I call a custard, but more like a thicker lassi.\n\nService was okay - when our waiter finally took our order, the food took awhile and our bill took awhile too.  The women serving the food could use a little brush up on how to clear a table.  Simple things like clearing the soup bowls before bringing out the other food might help a bit.  We were seated at a small table, so it was crowded with all our mini dishes.\n\nOverall, India Palace served up some good Indian food.  In general, I love the intense spices used in Indian cooking, and you definitely get it here.  I can't say how authentic it is, but from the many Indians eating there, I take that as a good sign.  It is a bit pricey though compared to other Indian restaurants.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jh7S78tc9oXCDjAjP_OrLw"}

This was probably the only tasty thing I enjoyed and I definitely didn't get enough of it.  Fried Calamari ($14.99) was the next to arrive.  When it comes down to it, one can never mess up calamari as long as you eat it while it's hot.  Some of the entrees I had a taste of included the Pepperoni Pizza ($19.99), Spaghetti Meat Balls $21.99), Chicken Marsala ($24.99), and Veal Limone ($24.99).  The pizza was not good, period.  The spaghetti meatballs was not bad, and the chicken marsala was the only decent entree available.  The real disgusting dish was the veal though. Blah!  It looked bad and tasted bad. \n\nWhen it came down to it, the dinner cost me $40 and I was still starving when I left.  It was such a waste! \n\nService was okay - not bad, not exceptionally good.

My only other experiences with a prime rib joint is the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco and Broadway Prime in Burlingame.\n\nThey know what they are doing here and they do it right.  With our party of seven, we were seated in the back room.  It's a bit drafty in the restaurant with the AC turned high, so bring a sweater or something.  \n\nOur quirky red-headed waitress who went by the name of Miss Motts, I believe, was informative and knew her stuff.  Did you know the the Lawry spice line was created after the restaurant was opened?  Apparently so many people asked about their seasonings that they decided to market it! \n\nMy choice cut was The Lawry Cut ($34), which is their standard cut of prime rib.  The Prime Rib dinner includes their \"Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad,\" Yorkshire Pudding, Mashed Potatoes with gravy, and Horseradish - two ways: homemade whipped cream and their store bought \"Atomic.\"  Other sides you can choose from a la carte include the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, Sizzling Skillet of Mushrooms, Lawry's Baked Idaho Potato, Creamed Spinach, Fresh Asparagus, Creamed Corn, and Buttered Peas.  Initially, I wasn't going to get any additional sides, but an order of the garlicky mushrooms came by and I definitely wanted some.  It's a variety of mushrooms that sitting in butter, garlic and white wine, I think.  They also put down a loaf of hot steaming sourdough bread.  The butter just melts on and I just love sourdough.  You have to remember not to fill up on that though 'cuz your meat is soon to arrive.\n\nShould you wish to say no to the prime rib (why bother coming then, right?), you can try their fresh fish of the day, lobster tails, or the rib eye steak.\n\nMake some room for dessert because they offer Creme Brulee, Chocolate Cake, Banana Cream Pie, Chocolate Bag, etc.  We opted for the Chocolate Bag ($7) which contained this chocolate mousse with fresh berries.  Yummy!\n\nService - our waitress was great in the very beginning and middle.  But my soda was never refilled, nor was any one else's.  She did come around though to refill coffee at the very end.  I also asked her for a box to take home the dessert.  I heard her ask another waitress and no one came with anything.  Eventually, I had to ask a busboy and he came around to take the dessert away and box it up.  It was a bit distracting waiting for that.\n\nIt's worth checking out their VIP Rewards program. It's a one time fee of $25, but you get a $25 Welcome Certificate to start.  And you get certificates for dining there or their sister restaurants, your birthday and anniversary.  They also have specials going on each month at each restaurant that might be worth checking their website or newsletter for.  \n\nYou can also make reservations online through their website or through Opentable.com too!\n\nUpdate! 11/02/07 - Returned to celebrate our anniversary dinner.  Both the BF and I had the Lawry's Cut.  We both noticed that the meat was a lot tougher to cut this time, like you definitely needed some elbow grease.  Nonetheless, we still finished up all our food and had no room for dessert.  We did ask our waitress if the beef came from the same company all the time, and she confirmed that it did.  When we mentioned our meat being a bit tough, she said that they would have automatically taken our prime rib away and given us a new slice from a different cart.  We wish we had known, so we could have switched our prime rib right off the bat.  Oh well, good to know for next time.  \n\n(Pics of our anniversary dinner posted in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "APe_0I6DqbNQonSlEkMSEQ"}

After a quick run to Costco on a Friday night, I pass by the \"Restaurant of the Month\" advertisement by the exit door.  A sushi place is being advertised...something about happy hours, live uni, etc.  I grab a brochure/menu and peruse it as we drive off.  \n\nMe: \"They offer live uni here...\"\nThe BF: \"Really? Do you think they have any left?\"\nMe: \"I'll call and find out!\"\n\nUnfortunately, they only had one left that day and we had a feeling we wouldn't get there in time.  Nonetheless, we decided to swing by for their late night happy hour, from 10 pm to 1 am.\n\nLocated in the Village Square right next to the movie theater, we see a large fish tank and ample seating with the sushi bar along the far back.  We sit up at the bar and notice their huge kitchen space back there.\n\nThe waitress gives us the happy hour menu, which is a bit different from their regular menu.  On this menu though, everything is \"Buy one get another one free.\"  This can be a good and bad thing.  Great for things like nigiri and such, but not so good with the big rolls.  With only the BF and I dining, ordering rolls wasn't a huge priority.  We were disappointed to hear they were out of hirame ($4.75/pr) and tai ($4.50/pr).  (\"It's late Friday night!\" claimed Jason, the sushi chef.)  But we did have a couple of orders of albacore ($4.50/pr) and ikura ($5/pr).  The albacore was smooth and fresh.  And the ikura had a decent about of eggs in there.  They also offer o-toro sashimi here too, which is the fattier more expensive toro, for about $28, I think.\n\nWe did go for one roll - the Spicy Scallop Roll ($6.25), which was surprisingly really good.  I really liked the crab and scallop mixture in the roll.  They split up their roll selection into four main groups - Beginners Sushi Rolls with nothing raw in it, the Low Carb Roll with no rice, Crispy Fried Rolls, and Advanced Sushi Lover Rolls.\n\nThey do start you off with a some edamame, which was complimentary.  Tea was $1.50/pp, so it's good to know that.  They were indeed out of live uni ($18), but it's good to know they do have it regularly on a limited amount though.  They also offer a 3 course lobster dinner that starts with lobster miso soup, lobster your way - sashimi style even if you want, and dessert, I think.  The chef brought our their live amaebi and live lobster so we could see, so that's on the plan the next time we go.  \n\nSummer hours are 11:30 am to 2 am now.  They offer two happy hours: 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 1am everyday.  Sake is also included in the happy hour specials.\n\nLunchtime combo plates from 11:30 am to 3:30 pm include a two item for $8.97 or a three item for $9.97, which includes rice and miso soup or mix green salad.  \n\nOverall, we're definitely curious about their other dishes, especially the live uni and lobster dinner.  (This can up their star status too.)  Happy hours are a great pick when you go with a large group, so you can taste a variety of their rolls without having to eat all of it yourself.  Definitely go back with a large group.\n\nUpdated! 09/04/07 - I went back last Friday and had their live uni!  So delicious and fresh!  Oh so good!  Their Yum Yum Scallop Roll was pretty good too - I like their scallops there for some reason.  We also snacked on the Salmon Skin Hand Roll too and tried some of their o-toro sashimi.  And those who know their sushi KNOW o-toro is special.  It's smooth and fatty and oh so good!  I also got to see their live lobster served five ways.  It's all presented on one dish and definitely looks like a special meal.  I moved their star status to a 4!\n\nUpdate! 10/29/07 - The BF and I are in the neighborhood and are craving live uni.  We already had dinner and were holding dessert (dark chocolate peppermint milkshakes from Cold Stone Creamery) when we walk up to the sushi bar to see if they have any on hand.  They do!  Yes, we had to pull up a seat and have an order of live uni.  Oh my gawd...so good!  We got a fatty one too! \n\n(I added some pics of the live uni in their business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "PF_L0dY7Ad76BleQ6Hc7Qg"}

On Mondays through Fridays, from 4:30 pm to 7 pm, $5 menu items for drinks and food are available.\n\nOf course, when we arrived the past Friday we didn't know about this special hour.  So our dinner reservations (celebrating Restaurant Week) turned into a happy hour feast.\n\nTaking a seat outside to enjoy the warm late summer evening, we looked over the drink menus.  With quite a selection, we began with:\n  \n* 1988 \"A tribute to our opening year in Honolulu.  Perfectly balanced blend of tart grapefruit and tangy pomegranate with ABSOLUT Ruby Red Vodka, SOHO Lychee Liqueur and Patron Citronge Liqueur echoes the idyllic island lifestyle.\" (HH $5) - Delicious.  This was the Husband's drink choice and I didn't give it a second thought because it had grapefruit in it.  However, I caught a whiff of the lychee and couldn't resist taking a sip.  It was good, without the bitterness of grapefruit.  For my second drink and his, we both ordered one of these.\n\n* Mango Mojito \"Fresh mango puree blended with Bacardi Limon Rum, hand-squeezed lime juice and freshly muddled mint.\" (HH $5)\n* Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich \"Garlic Parmesan Fries\" (HH $5) - This was my first drink choice and it was decent.  It wasn't as great as the 1988 though.\n\nFood bites:\n\n* Chicken & Shitake Mushroom Lettuce Wraps \"Chili Hoisin Dipping Sauce\" (HH $5) - A generous portion of bibb lettuce leaves and stuffing sat in a three sectioned platter along with the dipping sauce.  It probably could have been presented a bit better.  The lettuce wraps were okay, a bit too sweet though.  The Husband found it to be rather mushy, and I would have to be agree.  Not the highlight from this menu.\n\n* Crispy Mochiko Chicken Bites \"Madras Curry Aioli\" (HH $5) - Served in a bamboo steamer, a generous portion of chicken and dipping sauce arrived.  I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty chicken and the sauce complemented it nicely.  \n\n* Spicy Tuna Roll \"Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Kaiware\" (HH $5) - A simple roll cut into 8 pieces, but very good.  They do their sushi rice well here.  We ordered another one.\n\n* Japanese Shishito Peppers \"Sweet Su Miso Sauce\" (HH $5) - A surprise and delightful find.  We've had this elsewhere, but it was so much better here.  So good we ordered another.  I didn't use the dipping sauce, rather I dipped it back in the sauce it came in.\n\n* Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich \"Garlic Parmesan Fries\" (HH $5) - Sliced into two triangles, the sandwich looked exciting from across the table.  Then I noticed the bread, it's a lot thicker and softer, and I prefer it crispier as well.  The shredded cheese wasn't melted all the way, which I think contributed to the lack of gooeyness one expects from a grilled cheese sandwich.  I didn't even notice the pork in the sandwich as a result.  The fries were good though.\n\nService was okay, not as stellar as I have expected from the Roy's chain though.\n\n3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QySefgRL-TSHDNEd336FtA"}

And at $25, what a steal!  How could I resist?  I have already heard great things about this place by my Vegas go to man, so how can I say no?!  (I tried going on a weekend and only discovered then that they weren't open for lunch on weekends!  Wow!)  At Rosemary's, there is a good selection of starters, entrees, and desserts to choose from for the prix-fix menu, making this place an ideal choice for a variety of palates.\n\nTo start, I had the recommended Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.  What a fabulous and light salad to start with!  The cheese is swirled into the beef and has an amazing mix of flavors going on in your mouth!  Yum yum!\n\nMy entree was the Soy Marinated Bistro Filet Kabobs with Prosciutto-Wild Mushroom Hash, Micro Greens & Caramelized Shallot Reduction Sauce.  The kabobs came on two skewer sticks.  They were small pieces of beef, but full of flavor.  The mix of mushrooms and greens complemented the dish well.  My companion had his favorite - the Crispy Leg of Duck Confit on a bed of French Green Lentils with a Brandy Green Peppercorn Sauce. The crispy skin of the duck was full of flavor, but the dish wasn't a particular favorite of mine.  I was more pleased with my beef kabobs.\n\nFor dessert, I closed with the Chocolate Flourless Cake with Scotch Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Ice Cream.  I noticed they were offering Peppermint Ice Cream in another dessert and asked if they could substitute the vanilla for peppermint and it was done!  The toasted almond slivers added a nice crunch to the cake and sweet ice cream.  The cookie underneath the ice cream also added a nice bite to the lovely dessert as well.  I was pleased with my choice!  My companion had the Goat Cheese Cheesecake with Scotch Caramel Sauce.  The goat cheese was a bit heavy for me, especially after my very filling starter and entree, so I was glad I stuck with my chocolate cake.  He seemed quite content with the stronger tasting and pungent dessert than I.\n\nService - amazingly fabulous!  Servers here are particularly anal and I love it!  The old school way of serving from the left and taking from the right applies here!  And my favorite - the waiters wait until all plates are present and they are set down in front of each diner at the same time.  Love it!  They also fold your napkin and push in your chair should you use the restroom during your meal.  This place works fabulously as a team and they get FIVE stars on service alone!  (This was just for lunch too!)  I can't wait to go back for more!\n\nSide note: Check out their website for various promotions going on like half price wine night on Sundays and ladies' night on Wednesdays, which means half off!  You can even purchase $100 GC for $79.99 at Las Vegas Costcos!\n\nUpdate!  02/02/08 - Had the pleasure of having their prix-fix lunch here again today and couldn't pass up the \"Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.\"  It's so good that the BF and I each order our own plate.  (We usually like to get different things and share, but this one is so good we just want our own!)\n\nFor the main, I had the \"Creole Seasoned Shrimp with Anson Mills Carolina Cheesy Quick Grits, Andouille Red Bean Sauce & Grilled Green Onion.\"  It was so much food!  Embarrassingly, I couldn't finish it all!  Too much grits!  \n\nThe BF had \"Rosie's Monte Cristo - Ham, Turkey & Cantal Cheese on Battered Dipped Brioche with Crispy Onion Crust.\"  I especially liked his flaky and light onion rings.  Again, very plentiful and he couldn't finish it all either!\n\nThe BF ordered some kind of dessert that I forgot the name of.  The waiter said it was really good, but it was alright to us.  (You can check out the photos from the business profile and tell me what it was!)  I had the trio of seasonal sorbets because you can never go wrong with seasonal sorbets!  Yum yum!\n\nWe had to sit in the front this time since there were no tables available where we could sit side by side.  Service was still good for the most part, but I think it's a bit better when you're inside.  And I should mention the yummy bread rolls they give you in the beginning, oh so good!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5FE1Y9cZ-YOQA943nTi7cA"}

It's easy to order, most everyone likes it, and there's usually more than enough to go around.  I don't eat much of it outside the home, especially if it's just the two of us.  But since we had our friend with us, sharing a pie was the way to go.\n\nIt's my first time at Metro Pizza and the Husband has good things to say about the place.  While the guys decide on their pizza of choice, I'm curious about Our Famous House-Baked Garlic Knots \"Six of our freshly baked and famously soft Garlic Knots.\" ($4.95) and the Husband and waiter definitely agrees to my great choice.\n\nThe guys decide on a large of The Gotham \"Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, Green Peppers, Ground Beef, and Onions\" ($22.95).\n\nWe also decide to share a bottle of the Volpi, Barbera d'Asti from Piedmonte, Italy ($22).  It wasn't quite what we expected, but that was our fault.\n\nWarm bread and butter are then brought to our table, which I find interesting to receive at a pizza shop.  We already have a lot of bread coming our way, but it's still appreciated.  \n\nThe garlic knots arrive with marinara sauce and it's so good - so good because it's doused in garlic butter!  Yum yum!  Your fingers are dripping from the oily goodness and I had more than my fair share.\n\nWhen the pizza arrives, it looks pretty generous.  We all dive in and my first response is that \"It could be warmer...\"  The Husband agrees because from his seat, he saw that the pizza had been sitting on the counter for our waiter to bring to us for awhile.  So it could have arrived piping hot like it should have.  Chunky pieces of sausage are the first thing I notice and the last thing I remember.  It's pretty good stuff, and yes, we had leftovers.\n\nOverall, good pizza, huge restaurant space.  Service could be improved, especially by bringing our pizza over when it's ready.  (It was near empty when we came on a Saturday night.)  Other yelpers mentioned the cost, they do have coupons in the Entertainment Book to help with that concern.\n\n3.5 stars\n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "5yMcbS15CfhSvVQWCe79tw"}

When approaching the restaurant after walking through the maze of Mandalay Bay, it may appear that Border Grill isn't very large.  However, you'll find lots of large tables available downstairs too.  \n\nThey seat you down with plenty of salty tortilla chips and a tiny platter of three sauces.  There was one that was green that I just loved, and another one of the two red ones that was yummy too.  \n\nDrink orders first!  I had their Cruzan Mojito, which is described as \"Cuba's most popular cocktail; cruzan estate light rum muddled with fresh mint, lime, and a touch of soda.\"  This was oh-so yum and among the best mojitos ever.  However, not so strong but tasty indeed.  I also tried someone else's Mango Mojito and it was oh-so yummy too!  The BF had the Caipirinha, which is \"a Brazilian classic, fresh juices muddled with sugar drowned in ypioca cachaca.\"  It tasted a bit better than my previous experience with Caipirinha, but still a bit strong tasting.\n\nOur waiter was super friendly and a such a doll.  They get you going when they offer the Guacamole (mashed avocado with cilantro, red onion, jalapeo, and lime).  It's standard fresh guacamole, nothing particularly special about it but it does come with a little salad of something or other on the side.\n\nNot sure what to order, I ask for suggestions from the waiter and comes up with a few.  I decide on the Grilled Skirt Steak, which is \"marinated in garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime; served with charred corn relish, tomato avocado salad, and black beans.\"  I chose my steak rare and it came out nicely to my liking.  The initial bite was very enjoyable...tasty and delicate.  However, as I ate the rest of my steak, I felt it lacked some flavor.  I ended up dipping my steak into the sauces left on the table for the chips to give it a kick.  The tomato avocado salad was a nice blend of heirloom tomatoes that was a nice accompaniment, but the charred corn relish was a bit too hard for my tastes.  (The BF finished it off though.)  And the black beans were standard too.  This came with a large flour tortilla that I ended up not eating.\n\nThe BF had the Cochinita Pibil, which is \"achiote marinated pork slow roasted in banana leaf with cinnamon, grilled onions, black beans, and plantain orange salsa.\"  It was recommended by the waiter because it came from southern Mexico and is considered a rare dish to find on a menu.  I took the first bite and gave it back to the BF.  The pork was nothing special and I was disappointed.  The BF wasn't so impressed either as he kept on eating my steak instead.  It came with corn tortillas that the BF felt overpowered the pork.  And the plantains were okay too.\n\nOverall, the food was okay.  Dinner for the two of us costs $84, which is definitely not worth it when eating Mexican food.  (Both of us have been to central Mexico, so it's a little hard to justify spending so much on this type of food.)  I would be curious if they had a happy hour just for drinks and appetizers though.  Then you'll see me coming back to drink up on their mojitos! \n\nSidenote:  Watch out for their elevator.  With the six of us in it, it made a funny sound that had us catching our breath for a moment.  And I know we didn't eat all that much now!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q_Rwcv9APBLggk2KAsBEvg"}

No biggie, except that we were not seated until almost 8:45 pm.  Yes, the hostess did come out and apologize for the wait (explaining that the previous party was taking a little longer than expected).  \n\nInstead of bread and butter, we got edamame with a spicy salt finish.  It had us licking our lips and drinking lots of water before we got our orders in.\n\nI had initially planned on going for the winter prix-fixe menu at $35/pp.  You get to choose an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert from a specific menu.  However, I was distracted by the Roy's Classic Trio ($29).  This included \"Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi & Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.\"  It's served with \"citrus ponzu sauce, spicy soy mustard butter, and sizzling soy vinaigrette.\"  \n\nHearing about their exquisite butterfish, I couldn't resist.  And I figure with a trio, I could taste a bunch of different things.  In retrospect, I should have gone straight for the entree of \"Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish\" ($28) because it was SO good and I could have done without the salmon and ahi.  \n\nThe BF was intrigued by the \"Yama Mama Meatloaf\" ($19), that came with \"sesame crusted flat bread and a Shanghai hoisin demi.\"  He thought it was surprisingly good.  \n\nWe also shared the \"He'e Nalu Style Backyard Chili Pepper Poke\" ($13) since this location didn't offer the fabulous Poketini.  It's \"Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna and Cucumber Kim Chee Fusion\" and it's pretty darn good!  Yum yum!  (Get your own plate, you don't want to share this one!)\n\nBe sure to put your order in early for the \"Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle\".  And if you don't know what that is, it's \"flourless chocolate cake with a molten hot center\" and served with ice cream.  It takes awhile to make, so let them know when you order your entree.  (I guess the waiter didn't hear one of our dining companions order his souffle and he was not happy when only one came out.  He didn't like  the idea of sharing his wife's souffle and he didn't want to have to wait for another one to come out.)  I'm not always a fan of this dessert but at Roy's, they really know how to do it well.  I was practically licking the plate!\n\nFor cocktails, I had a Guava Mojito that was so yummy!  It tasted like a Kern's!  The BF had a Pomegranate Mojito, but agreed mine was tastier. \n\nWith the delay in seating, I half expected them to comp us for something, anything for that matter.  Give the birthday boy a free drink for making us wait so long, but nope, didn't happen.  They also gave our table the whole check for the party of 16, which was ridiculous to break down (especially since we were seated at two tables).  We asked the waiter if he could split the check which he was able to, it would have been better if this was automatically done instead.    \n\nOverall, Roy's is great for Hawaiian-influenced Asian-fusion.  Their service is usually top notch and for the most part, there's something for everyone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UpkfQApZT5rctZicZ_ZTgw"}

Their chef's counter really gives you a bird's eye view of the happenings of the kitchen.  In this experience, we not only engaged with the staff, but watched the dynamics of some errors that happened in the pick-up station.\n\nAs we waited for our dinner to begin, the sushi chef offered us an appetizer of shrimp tempura.  This shrimp tempura was perfectly fried, and the tasty miso barbecue (with mustard seed) dressing was very tasty.  It was a great beginning already.\n\nThe Restaurant Week prix fixe menu was $30.09.  My mind was on one thing only, which wasn't offered in this prix fixe unfortunately.  So, this is what The Husband got:\n\n* Roy's Appetizer Trio \"Baby Back Ribs, Seared Tiger Shrimp Stick, Crispy Pork & Shrimp Lumpia\" - Shrimp was cooked perfectly, ribs were tasty, and the lumpia was decent too.\n\n* Char Siu Marinated Pork Chop \"Cilantro Scented Forbidden Black Rice, Asian Plum 5-Spice Demiglaze\" - You could smell the char sui sauce as the plate appeared.  The pork chop was moist and tasty.  It was a hearty portion that sat on some Asian greens.\n\nNow I learned my lesson the last time I was at Roy's.  I ordered the Roy's Classic Trio which gives you a sampling of three of their fish dishes. DO NOT ORDER THIS!  Once you get your mouth on the butterfish, you'll wish you ordered that instead.  So I warn you now, just go straight past the Trio, and head for the entree version of the butterfish.  You'll be so glad you did.  And that is exactly what I did!  \n\n* Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish \"Chinese Sizzling Soy Vinaigrette\" ($28.95) - The fish is so buttery, literally.  It's so soft and supple and just flakes so nicely.  The dipping sauce is light and just perfect for this fish.  I wasn't digging the rice as much though, I wish I had The Husband's Forbidden Black Rice instead.  Asian greens rest beneath the fish.\n\n* Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle \"Flourless Chocolate Cake with a Molten Center, Raspberry Coulis, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\" - Yes, this is the dessert to get.  I'm not even the biggest fan of molten chocolate cakes, but I like Roy's version a lot.  He does this dessert so well - so gooey, and sweet, and just yum.  I was thinking that my homemade vanilla ice cream was tasting a bit better than theirs though.\n\nService this past Sunday evening reflected the kind of service I'm used to and expect from Roy's.  The counter staff really go out of their way to talk to you, and the rest of the staff were friendly and did their job.  They had a large party near us, so we had various staff members throughout the evening and they all reflected what Roy's customer service is all about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UpkfQApZT5rctZicZ_ZTgw"}

With only four seats left at the sushi bar, we take two of them near the end.\n\nThe waitresses got us our beverage orders and bring out a little plate of cooked bean sprouts.  And then we started ordering with our sushi chef.\n\nFirst attempt - uni.  The chef looks at us and says they are out.  Oh.  (I should have gone with my gut and just left then and there!)\n\n* Seafood Salad - One order per person, and so we got one each.  Definitely generous with the cuts of fish - tuna and mackerel mostly on a bed of cucumbers and daikon radish with a spicy sauce.\n\n* Amaebi - He asks us if we want the heads and we say yes, although we wonder if there's an extra charge for it.  Two pieces come out, no rice.  We don't complain about the lack of rice, but wonder why only two pieces when we did say two orders.  (This item is one of the \"one order limit per person\" and we know two pieces is usually one order.)  The heads are deep-fried, but not enough as I had to spit out some of it.  When we attempted to order our 2nd order of it later on, he gives us this look and says we are trying to order more than we are allowed.  We're confused at this point, and ask him if two pieces account for one order.  He says it does, for the 'other' amaebi.  He then pulls out this plate of these tiny sweet shrimp that I would have been insulted if I got.  So, since we chose to get the heads, we got the jumbo size one (regular size in every other sushi restaurant) and that means only ONE PIECE per person.  Oh.\n\nWe continue on with our nigiri choices:\n \n* yellowtail, albacore, salmon, halibut, giant clam (one order limit) and ikura - We're confused when we get our fish because one of them is obviously tuna - it's bright pink and you just know and plus we didn't order that.  Later on when we ask for hamachi, thinking that it never came, it points out that he did give us hamachi already, it was the pink one he served us earlier.  Oh?  Hmmm... Also, there's too much rice for the size of fish cuts he gave us.  That's never a good thing.\n\nAnd with the whole mix up of the amaebi and the lack of uni, he offers us 'hamachi belly'.  This is the all white version and yes, it's good.  But this is what I normally get when I order hamachi at a nice sushi restaurant.  So, I still don't know what their version of regular hamachi looks like!  \n\nFrom the appetizers, we got softshell crab (I wasn't particularly fond of their batter for this.), agedashi tofu (pretty good with an enjoyable batter), and hamachi kama.  One thing for certain was that things coming out of the kitchen were super hot, so watch your tongue! \n\nWe're not big on rolls, and perhaps this is also why we weren't as impressed.  They are known for their rolls as many yelpers mention, and since we didn't focus on their strengths, we weren't as pleased.\n\nTheir saving grace is that there's no limit on dessert!  Unlimited ice cream (green tea, red bean, and plum) and mochi ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, mango, and chocolate - although they were out of vanilla when I went).\n\nService - the waitresses do come often enough to clear dishes if you put them on the side, but don't bother if you leave them in front of you.  I did have to request more tea, so it just depends.  Our sushi chef wasn't the most personable, which set the tone for our dinner.  He was hollering at us from the start, and plus, I couldn't understand him either.\n\nLike another yelper mentioned, we were the only other Asian people there (besides the staff), so if that makes a difference to you.  And it gets loud - as in you can hear the conversations of people from across the room - not sure if it's the people who are loud or the acoustics of the restaurant.\n\nYama Sushi is definitely one of the cheaper options for AYCE sushi (Lunch $19.95/pp or Dinner $22.95/pp) in Vegas, but we'd rather pay a few bucks more for a better experience.  We probably won't be back.\n\n2.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "eLPld7Q17XxlclFGzZQX5g"}

I loved the sweetness from the fruit topping and whipped cream, but then I would get this tangy sour taste from the cream cheese as well.  I wasn't sure if I was enjoying that part or not.  But I still ate it all up nonetheless! \n\n* Chicken Fried Steak Southern- Style \"U.S.D.A. Certified Choice breaded steak served over our new recipe biscuits and smothered in homemade country gravy.  Served with two extra large eggs and hashbrowns.\" ($10.79) - The Husband is always getting these super fatty dishes and couldn't resist here either.  Although the menu says it served over biscuits, I couldn't really remember if it was and from the picture, I don't see any.

She also mentioned something about their wine too.\n\nIt was pretty slow the past Memorial Day weekend.  Only one or two other parties dining when we arrived at 6 pm.  \n\nWe chose a table right in the middle and menus were brought to us.  The first being the 2 for 1 menu with 11 items as mentioned, and their regular menu.  We also learned that all bottles of wine were 50% during this special.\n\nA quick look at the specials menu and we were a bit surprised - Maine Lobster Tail with NY Strip ($65); Bone-in Ribeye ($68), Pan Seared Cod with a Caper Cream Sauce ($42); etc.  My initial impression of two entrees for under $30 was that it was misleading.  Sure, they did have one item for $30, but everything else cost upwards to that.\n\nWe both settled on the Center Cut Top Sirloin ($30), and all entrees come with the Famous Tillerman Salad, Seasoned Veggies, and Mashed Potatoes.\n\nWarm bread and whipped butter were the first to arrive.  The waiter was very pleasant and friendly.\n\nOur salad arrived on a lazy susan with four romaine lettuce heads, iceberg lettuce mix, sliced cucumbers, grated cheese, peppers, marinated mushrooms, garbanzo and lima beans, tomatoes, and two dressings - a balsamic vinegar and a blue cheese.  A generous make-your-own salad is a nice idea, although the mushrooms were a bit dried out.  Both dressings were pretty good though.  \n\nAfter getting our fill of salad, the lazy susan was removed along with our salad plates.  \n\nNext came our steaks with the sides as mentioned.  We both ordered it rare, and it came out as ordered.  We were asked if we wanted our mushroom sauce on the side or on top, we both chose on the side.  The mixed veggies included yellow squash, bok choy, and red bell peppers.  It was actually pretty good and a had a nice sweet sauce on it.  The mashed potatoes were pretty enjoyable too, creamy and buttery.  The steak was only okay.  For a place that prides themselves as being a steakhouse, I expect mouth-watering, orgasmic-worthy beef.  I hate when my knife doesn't slide smoothly through a piece of beef, as in this case.  The Husband said maybe it was just the cut of beef, but I wasn't too impressed.  The mushroom sauce wasn't exactly my favorite either, so I was glad that it was on the side.  They could probably work on using smaller plates or assembling the food a bit better so it looks more appetizing too.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, although they offered items like Vanilla Bread Pudding, Tillerman Cheesecake, and Pick Me Up \"Espresso Soaked Ladyfingers with a Marscapone Mousse\".\n\nService was great - our waiter and busboy refilled our beverages without us asking, they were always professional and did their job well.  The hostess also came by to check on how everything was, and it was fine for the most part.  (It's hard for me to complain about a piece of beef because we both personally don't like it.)\n\nOverall, the food had some hits and misses.  The sides tasted better than the steak, and the salad was a great idea but losing it luster.  Service is top-notch, but food still has to reign supreme to do well.  Prices are a bit high with Surf and Turf specials ranging in the $46 to $85 range.  Sure, we got a great deal with their 2 for 1 special, but we don't think it was worth $30 a piece.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5YJTg4792Pf0QcpSbnu9dw"}

When I took a sip, oh my goodness, wow!  This was one damn good mojito!  I had the Husband and another friend try it, and they were sold immediately!  The Husband got the Grapefruit variety, while our friend got a Berry one too.  I also tried the Lychee one later on.  I'm not usually a fan of fresh grapefruit, but it reminded me more of grapefruit soda and I liked it too, better than the Lychee one.\n\n* Draft beer (Kirin Ichiban) (HH $1.95 / reg $3.50) - The guys did get beer to start, but soon moved on to mojitos!\n\nI had planned on trying one of their Chu-Hi \"Made from Asian Vodka 'Shochu' with Refreshing Fruit Flavor\" drinks, specifically the Blueberry flavor (HH $4.95 / reg $6.95), but got stuck on the mojitos!  Oh well, next time!\n\nFoodwise: \nI had to ask first, do they use sriracha in their hot sauce?  (I'm not a fan of it in my sushi.)  And thank goodness, no!  I was all aboard!\n\n* Spicy Tuna Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $4.75) - My staple, as long as I like the hot sauce and I like it here.  Yum.\n\n* Lotus on Fire Roll \"Spicy Tuna, Lotus Root, and Jalapeno on top of California roll\" (HH $5.95 / reg $9.95) - This was beautifully presented with a deep-fried lotus root sitting on each piece, complete with a jalapeno slice.  There's also some spicy crunchy things on one side and more hot sauce on the other side.  It's a pretty tasty roll with a lot of heat, so good that we ordered another roll!\n\n* Salmon Skin Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $3.95) - Served with six pieces, the bonito flakes add a nice smokey taste to it.  It was good.\n\n* Aladdin Roll \"Spicy Albacore and Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura\" (HH $5.95 / reg $7.95) - Another tasty roll with a bit less heat and a nice subtle crunch from the masago.\n\n* Rose Roll (HH $5.95 / reg $8.95) \"Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura, A-Grade Avocado and Spicy Tuna\" - We're all liking the spicy tuna, so how could this go wrong?\n\nOverall, we were all pleasantly surprised with the drinks and food offered, even at the happy hour.  Service was good, our waitress Briana, was always checking up on us and making sure we had enough food and drink.  We'd definitely go back for more happy hour action now!\n\nThey also have a Red Mask Club so you can earn points when you dine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5FPU_0VSLtR2yY7IQzaH5g"}

I can attest that yes, indeed, these chicken wings and drumettes are big ole things.  There's a lot of batter and meat on these babies, but I couldn't say so much for the taste itself.  Because we were dousing it in ranch dressing and hot sauce, of course it tasted fabulous.  But take away all of that, and I wasn't so sure there was so much flavor in the chicken or batter itself.  Bummer.  They do a fine job though giving it to you on the crispy crunchy end, and we like crispy crunchy things! \n\nThey do have a pretty extensive beer on tap selection, which is always impressive.  I'm a pear cider kind of girl for now...\n\nThey have various specials from late night craving deals to specialties of the day.  And who doesn't love a place that's open 24 hours?\n\nI'm on a mission to find tastier chicken wings that this!  Bring it!\n\nUpdate! 10/08/07 - I'm 1/3 of the way through my \"Down The Hatch!\" card!  Yay!  What the heck is that?!  They have this frequent beer drinker card and when you drink 30 of their beers, you get a free gift.  The BF is on card #3 already and is a proud owner of a Crown and Anchor T-shirt and Crown and Anchor soccer shirt.  (I'm hoping for the baby doll tee myself.)  They have some cool bartenders working here and a pool table upstairs as well.  We brought out of town guests and they loved the place!  I think they had live music the past Saturday.  We got there a bit too late and saw them putting their equipment away.  Yay for live music! And there's all you can eat fish and chips on Monday nights and happy hours from 3 pm to 6 pm!  Another cool thing is that they are showing football (soccer) games on the TV, and if you come by really late at night, they'll still have games on!\n\nSidenote:  They even offer a free shuttle pickup service!

(Other Indian restaurants don't offer it complimentary anymore!)  Both entrees were so flavorful and just delicious that we couldn't resist checking out their ever so popular lunch buffet option.  \n\nThe daily lunch buffet is $9.99 with kids 3 and under being free.  (Ages 4 to 7 years are $5.99.)  It's offered from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm.\n\nOne thing I appreciated was that they noted what food items were vegetarian and vegan.  As someone who recently stopped eating dairy, I found this very useful.\n\nWhen ordering naan, I was able to get this sans butter, which was quite appreciative in my situation.  And with my  new dietary restrictions, I was still able to enjoy quite a lot of food items and left feeling full and satisfied! \n\nTheir buffet menu can be found on their website, but it does change. \n\nOverall, we were both quite content with their food, a la carte or buffet.  Definitely one of the better Indian buffets in town, especially if you're looking for a vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free menu!", "type": "review", "business_id": "gkWEjZIVcrUerEzed6IKpg"}

We found ourselves here last Friday night (conveniently on the very busy First Friday too).\n\nStarving and not wanting to wait, we decided to sit out front in this hot Vegas evening weather.  Tortilla chips with salsa and warm bean dip with cheese melting into it arrived swiftly at our table.  I was already impressed!  (I don't think I ever got beans with my chips before!)  We were chomping away on the chips and dip!  Yum-my!\n\nWhat to drink?!  I went for the Mango Margarita ($4.99) on the rocks.  The BF went for what is known as a Red Beer, Clamato with beer and hot sauce.  Now, this was delicious!  I ended up drinking more of his beer than my margarita.  Don't get me wrong, the margarita was good, I realized I wasn't craving the sweetness of it anymore once I got a taste of his beer!  Their Pina Colada is a bit hit at $8.99 and served in a hollowed out pineapple.\n\nTheir menu is huge and extensive!  We had no idea where to start since we wanted to try a bit of everything.  We ended up with the Mixta Ceviche ($4.99), which comes with shrimp, octopus, fish, and lots of avocado.  It's a hearty portion and the octopus was pretty tender.  Not rubbery at all.  We also did the tacos ($1.99) a la carte - six of them!  Two each of the al pastor, carnitas, and the lengua.  They were loaded up with meat and guacamole.  The BF didn't expect them to be so filling and we actually couldn't finish it all!\n\nService was fab!  Our waiter and busboy were super friendly and always had a smile on their face!  Everyone seems pretty happy there - the diners and employees, so it makes your dining experience all that much better!\n\nThis place is popular, I even ran into Allison J. who had dined there earlier that evening!

It took forever to get our order in, to get plates, to get our check, to pay for the bill, etc.  Service was just lacking altogether.  By the time we did get our plates (which we had requested early on), our food was not hot.  Reminders about more chips, beans, and salsa were forgotten.\n\nFood was still good though!  Chips with warm refried beans and cheese and hot salsa are always a joy to munch on here.  Our party of three ordered a few dishes to share.\n\n* Carnitas de Puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo ($8.99) - Generous amount of shredded pork.  More than enough for one person.  And it was moist and tasty, not dry at all.\n\n* 3 Enchiladas de Pollo con arroz y frijoles ($9.99) - It was good, not my favorite of the bunch. I spent more time eating everything else.  We chose the chicken for all three, although you can get beef or cheese as well.\n\n* Carne Asada (estilo Casa Don Juan) con arroz, frijoles y guacamole ($10.99) - A decent size piece of steak covered with onions.  It took forever to cut with the butter knife they give.  They either have to cut it in strips or give you a steak knife so you can cut into it better.\n\nWe also ordered three micheladas.  But the waiter said it's called something else when there's hot sauce in it.  I forgot.  Oh well.  But it was pretty good nonetheless.\n\nThere was a slight discrepancy with the bill where they charged us for another beer.  It's always a pain to find things added on your bill and having to get them to fix it.  So double check your bill when dining here.\n\nOverall, it's still a great place for Mexican food with great atmosphere.  Wonderful people watching when sitting outside, but it always seems lively when I pop in to use the loo.  (Not sure how the atmosphere outside would be should it not be First Friday.)\n\n3.5 stars.\n\n(Pics posted from our dinner!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "gu5Yj92bnXnxNyMdxO14VA"}

After our little jaunt to Peru a couple of months ago, we wanted to see what Little Dumpling had to offer!\n\nLittle Dumpling serves two types of food - Chinese and Peruvian.  You'll find two separate menus, so it's really two restaurants in one.  And you'll definitely notice the Chinese influenced Peruvian food since there's a decent amount of Chinese immigrants in Peru.\n\nGoing for the staple, the BF ordered the Lomo Saltado ($9.95).  I decided to be a bit adventurous and went for their Cau Cau de Pollo ($9.00), which seemed like chicken in yellow curry.  The BF liked their Lomo Saltado because the french fries were still crispy and it tasted pretty good.  My chicken dish was pretty basic, and I was dumping a lot of their green sauce on there.  Both are generous orders and a bit pricey, in my opinion.  The BF asked if they served quinoa, but the waiter looked at us like he didn't know what we were talking about.  Oh well.  I figure we better not ask if they serve cuy or alpaca either then!\n\nThe cool thing is that they serve Inca Cola!  It comes in cans though, but will bring you straight back to Peru when you get a taste of this sweet yellow stuff.\n\nService is pretty slow.  It was a weekday around dinner time.  They had one customer finishing up and had a few people come in for to go orders.  We had to ask the waiter a couple of times for a take out box for our leftovers, and it took him awhile to get these.  (We were in rush 'cuz I had a flight to catch!)\n\nOverall, it satisfied our curiosity about what Little Dumpling was serving up.  Their Peruvian menu isn't in English, so good luck with that.  Maybe their ceviche might be worth checking out?\n\n(Pics of our beef and chicken dishes are posted on their business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_QU1ljIIZehmGMtGKgpbg"}

However, I have also been missing out on my sushi runs and finally had the opportunity for some raw fish this past weekend.\n\nHaving been to their sister restaurant on Sahara, I was familiar with Sushi Mon's all-you-can-eat menu.  For $29.95, you have an hour to chow down on nigiri, rolls, appetizers, tempura, and dessert.  For those not wanting to participate in the race, you can order from their a la carte menu as well.  \n\nFor such limited items like Amaebi (don't forget to ask for the fried heads that come with them!) and Uni, it's only one order (a pair) per person.  Otherwise, diners like myself would have them running out of that stuff quick!  I also had some of their nigiri, and their specialty rolls - 9-1-1 Roll, Spider Roll, and Pixie Roll among others.  I had a better experience with their Hamachi Collar this time compared to my experience at the other Sushi Mon.  Order half orders on the rolls so you can try more out and aren't stuck with 8 pieces all to yourself! \n\nAnd for dessert - I like their Plum Sherbet, Lychee Sherbet, and Green Tea Ice Cream.  I never made it around to their Mochi this time unfortunately.\n\nUpdate! 09/14/07 - I made the mistake of ordering their Spider Roll which is huge and filled with crab meat filler!  Blah!  Be sure to ask what their daily fish specials are.  They had bonito and live scallops when we went, and the scallop was pretty good.  Their scallop nigiri is cooked scallop, which is something I didn't really care for.  I got a chance to try their Mochi Vanilla this time, yum!  I think I did a good job of eating my fill!\n\nSidenote: They offer frequent eater cards!  Eat 10 times there and get one free!

Located in the Spa Tower and nearby the hotel lobby, views from the restaurant include the surrounding garden and pools (not swimming pools).\n\nMaking our way past the Ceres Lounge and the bar, we were warmly greeted by the host.  Asking if we had reservations (which we did not), we were seated right by the windows.  It was very quiet on this Sunday evening with only another party or two of diners.  \n\nAs menus graced our table, beverage orders were taken.  Hot bread rolls with cute little butter pads arrived next as we waited for our appetizer to arrive.\n\nThe BF was immediately intrigued by their Fresh Shrimp \"Saganaki\" ('Tomato, Kalamata Olive, Lemon, Capers, Feta Cheese' - $14).  He had saganaki once before and really enjoyed it, so he wanted me to try it.  When it arrived, it wasn't quite what he expected.  Saganaki is usually a Greek appetizer that includes fried or broiled cheese.  The cheese is usually flambeed at the table and then doused with lemon juice.  We mentioned to the waiter how it was different from what we had expected, and the waiter said they used to light the dish on fire at the table, but after an incident where a tie caught on fire, they now light it in the back.  Nonetheless, the three chunky shrimps were cooked to perfection and the light sauce complimented the dish quite nicely. \n\nThe waiter recommended the Rosemary & Garlic Marinated Domestic Lamb Rack ('Ratatouille Gratin, Herb Potato Puree, Sauce Bordelaise - $38), which is what the BF was easily sold on.  The lamb came out beautifully presented, along with a nice side dish of the gratin and mashed potatoes.  The BF enjoyed his perfectly cooked lamb and buttery potatoes.\n\nI had the Chargrilled Delmonico Steak ('Confit Fingerling Potatoes, Sauteed French Beans, Natural Veal Reduction' - $34).  It came out cooked the way I wanted it along with a nice offering of potatoes and beans.  The side dishes were ample and very delicious.\n\nWe were both impressed with the food and the service.  Our waiter was very personable, refilled our beverages without being asked, and offered suggestions as well.  A manager came by during our meal to also check on how our meal was, so they were quite thorough.    \n\nWe did ask our waiter if they were normally this quiet and he expressed that depending on what functions were being held at the hotel, the pace does change.  The night before, he mentioned, was quite busy while this evening was a very relaxed.  \n\nThe lighting were we sat was quite dim, which others can deem as quite romantic.  For us, we should have asked to sit under the light because we like to look at our food, but we weren't that anal this time to move.\n\nThey describe this restaurant as American-style fare with a Mediterranean influence.  It is a bit pricey and wouldn't normally be a place I'd go for dinner on a regular evening.  But I think they can do well for a nice meal out with friends and such.\n\n(I posted pics of our dinner in the business profile section!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "0QtGVVXoDnKJxPA0v2yckA"}

It usually leaves you satisfied without breaking the budget.  And if they treat you well during this midday meal, you're more likely to come for dinner and try their sushi too.  (I do hate how many of them close for business in between that lunch and dinner hour though, which luckily, isn't the case with Tokyoto.)\n\nLocated next to Caffe Gelato in the Bocapark Mall, you walk into this pleasant and bright Japanese restaurant.

It's not long before she returns with our tea and complimentary suno mono (cucumber salad).  \n\nMy choice for today is their Lunch Special #1 which is Chicken Teriyaki, Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura, and California Roll ($7.95).    The BF gets their Lunch Special #4, which is Tonkatsu, Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura, and California Roll ($9.95).  (Rice and miso soup automatically comes with all the lunch specials.)\n\nWhen our orders arrive, we are both pleasantly surprised with their generous portions.  A nice heaping side salad also accompanied our bento box (with a carrot-based dressing?).  Six pieces of CA roll instead of the pictured three pieces and five pieces of tempura - shrimp, onion, potato, zucchini, and carrot were presented before us (along with our chicken teriyaki or tonkatsu).  \n\nWe were initially thinking of adding a roll to our order since they had some unique ones that piqued our interest.  But after seeing our order come out, we knew we couldn't finish it all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very pleasant and refilled our beverages as needed.

A solid 3.5 stars.  \n\nWe'd definitely return to try out some of their unique rolls like the \"Who Your Daddy?\" roll (Spicy Yellowtail inside, Yellowtail and Jalapeno on top with Ponzu sauce $13.50) and the \"Heart Attack\" roll (Spicy Tuna, Cream Cheese, Jalapeno, & Deep Fried with House Sauce $9.50).", "type": "review", "business_id": "WsqAILgPniet5urqPFHocw"}

It was oh so good back then and I couldn't wait to have more!  I even had a chance to try their Muffalettas that time!\n\nWhen I walked into Jason's Deli again, i was super excited!  I couldn't wait to get a big cup of Sweet Tea ($1.59)!  I opted for their Manager's Half Sandwich Special, which is half of any sandwich on the menu (excluding muffalettas) and your choice of one: cup of soup, read beans with sausage and rice, spicy gumbo, chili or fruit for $6.50.  I had the Grilled Portobello Panini ($6.50), 'grilled portobello mushroom marinated in leo's italian dressing, fresh avocado spread, homemade pico de gallo, fresh spinach, and asiago cheese that's pressed between olive oil basted french bread.'  This actually isn't on the menu, but it's the combination of the Chicken Panini and the Grilled Portobello Wrapini.  I had the Tomato Basil soup with my sandwich.  My panini was yummy, a bit small though, but still very good.  It also came with Jason's potato chips.  I had a few stale ones in my batch though.  And the soup was yummy as well. \n\nThe BF had the Chicken Panini, 'marinated chicken breast with provolone cheese, basil pesto spread, sliced roma tomatoes and fresh spinach that's pressed between olive oil basted french bread' along with a cup of gumbo soup.  I just realized that I have no idea how his panini tasted because he never offered me a bite!  (Hmmff!  And you KNOW he got a bite of mine!)  I can't even comment on his gumbo either!\n\nMy friend had the California Club ($6.25), 'oven roasted turkey breast, homemade guacamole, tomato, sprouts, bacon, swiss, and mayo on a tasted all butter croissant.'  He proclaimed, \"It was the best sandwich I have ever had!\"  Unfortunately, his wife had the Chicken Pot Pie which she said was not good at all.  She barely touched it.  \n\nThe cool thing about Jason's Deli is that they offer free refills on their beverages, free soft serve, and free muffins!  Unfortunately, they ran out of the Sweet Tea!  This was maddening and they claimed they didn't have anymore for a Saturday afternoon!  The BF and I were deeply distraught about this incident.  When we asked another employee if they refilled the tea yet, she replied, \"You can go up there and check...\"  Gosh, I guess I'm used to a bit better customer service.  Oh well, what can you say?\n\nOverall, at Jason's Deli you go up and give your order and then pay for it.  You take your number and help yourself to your own beverages.  Take a seat and wait awhile for your food. Your order is brought to you on a tray and that's the end of the customer service there.  The menu ranges from soups to salads to pasta to wraps to baked potatoes to favorite sandwiches to make your own sandwiches to muffalettas to po'boys to paninis and wrapinis and a few desserts even.  They have a pretty large menu to choose from.  Since April 15, 2005, all their restaurants became free of partially hydrogenated oils, which means \"no trans fat\"!    \n\nYeah...I'll be back for their Sweet Tea...but you KNOW I'll be checking to make sure they have enough for our refills!", "type": "review", "business_id": "WZHIYPqGPaPQW97GNrkqjQ"}

Chang's, and I must say I've been pretty resistant in the past.\n\nWe had a gift card that we had to use up, so we figure we're in the Summerlin area and we may as well grab lunch.  There was easily no wait on a weekend afternoon, although we were told all the outside tables were taken.\n\nThey had about 9 offerings of lunch bowls that are served daily until 4 pm that include your entree being served on a bed of rice, and a cup of either Egg Drop or Hot & Sour soup.\n\nThey bring to your table a bunch of dipping sauces, about six of them that include soy sauce, hot chili sauce, vinegar, hot yellow mustard, hot chili oil, and one other thing.\n\nMy choice: \n* Egg Drop Soup \"A classic starter\" - It was piping hot when it arrived and with a bit of heat added to it, it wasn't too bad.  I was starving and drank it all up.  It was a bit darker than what I expected it to be though.\n\n* Buddha's Feast \"Veggies with five-spice tofu served steamed or stir-fried\" - I liked the fact that you can have brown or white rice, which is a nice perk you don't typically find at Chinese restaurants, but then again, this isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.  It's a generous portion for one, and I like their choice of veggies.  It had broccoli, asparagus, snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, and tofu all in my dish.  So, it's definitely a hearty dose of the good green veggies.  I definitely needed to add some heat to my dish and eventually added enough chili oil that my rice was swimming in it.\n\nThe Husband had: \n* Hot & Soup \"Either by the cup or bowl, this will warm your soul\" - I guess it was okay, and he did drink it up.  I don't ever order this, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like.\n\n* Sesame Chicken \"Back by popular demand...love the ginger, chili paste and garlic\" - He asked the waiter if they could make it extra spicy, which he said of course too.  Except that when the order arrived, the Husband said it tasted like they didn't put any hot spices in there.  He wasn't particularly fond of the sauce of the dish, but beyond the chicken was onions, broccoli, and bell peppers with black sesame seeds tossed in there.\n\nThey were offering 'mini' desserts that arrived in shot classes, which was a sampling for about $2/each.  We went for two kinds:\n\n* S'mores - The Husband thought this was too sweet for him, and it really was crushed graham crackers, a very sweet marshmallow creme, and chocolate sauce.\n\n* Strawberry Cheesecake - The Husband enjoyed this more, and all it really consisted of was crushed graham crackers, strawberry preserves, and white cream.  \n\n(They reminded me of something you could easily do at home, but I guess it satisfies your sweet tooth with having to purchase one of their bigger desserts.)\n\nOverall, the food was decent, and the portions were pretty generous for the price.  It'd be different to go for dinner and do family style though.  We noticed mostly everyone had to go boxes with them, although I found it weird how the staff would hold the to go box against their stomach and shovel the food into it.

It's a bit dark, which is great if you like that ambiance, not so good if you want to see your food in detail.\n\nTheir \"Prime Cocktail Hours\" runs everyday from 5 pm to 7pm, and 11 pm to 2 am.\n\nAll beers $3\nSelect Glasses of Wine $3\nAll Premium Pour Well Cocktails $4\nAll Appetizers and Flatbreads $8\nCheese Fondue $12\n\nWe definitely overdid it when we ordered:\n\n* Seasonal Raw Oysters \"Cocktail Sauce & Shallot Mignotte\" ($15) - Half a dozen large oysters and a cucumber salad started off our meal.  \n\n* Lump Crab Cakes \"Asian Slaw, Spicy Remoulade Sauce\" ($14) - Two crab cakes came in this order and they were tasty with a nice fill of crab inside, not just filler.\n\n* Stuffed Portobella \"Zucchini, Eggplant, Roasted Pepper, Mozzarella, Basil Oil, Balsamic Reduction\" ($10) - A lot of wonderful things in this vegetarian dish and oh-so yum!\n\n* Pork Potstickers \"Scallions, Water Chestnuts, Ginger, Lemongrass, Sweet & Sour Sauce\" ($12) - An order of deep-fried potstickers sitting on a bed of too much sauce.  Perhaps if they left the sauce on the side it would be a bit better.  Also, I'm more familiar with potstickers that are pan-fried more so than deep-fried.\n\n* Orange Satays \"Chicken and Beef Skewers, Cucumber Salad, Three Dipping Sauces\" ($13) - Four skewers each of chicken and beef, and it was the worst thing we order this evening.  Both meats were dry and hard to pull off the stick.  I wouldn't order this again.\n\n* Ahi Tuna Chips \"Blackened Rare Tuna, Crispy Wontons, Asian Slaw, Citrus Soy, Wasabi Oil\" ($14) - Four seared tuna slices sitting on a wonton with slaw and sauce all over it.  Maybe a little too generous with the sauce.\n\n* Beef Carpaccio \"Tenderloin of Beef, Crimini Mushroom, Arugula Salad, White Truffle Vinaigrette, Shaved Parmesan Cheese\" ($15) - Beautifully presented, it lacked enough vinaigrette, which ultimately meant it lacked some kick.  A few twists of cracked pepper would also help this dish.  \n\n* Beef Sliders \"Three Certified Angus Beef Sliders, Cheddar Cheese, Mini Kaiser Rolls, Grilled Onions, Russian Dressing\" ($11) - Tasty little handfuls with a dill pickle on each. \n\n* White Truffle Flatbread \"Mozzarella, Parmesan, Proscuitto, Truffle Oil, Micro Arugula\" ($15) - The fabulous smell of truffle oil is the first thing you'll notice, and then you'll enjoy the melted cheese and ham.\n\nFor our party of three, we definitely ordered way too much.  We couldn't eat it fast enough since there wasn't enough room on the table for all our dishes.  I think we ended up woofing most of it down just to make room, which meant we couldn't enjoy it as much as we would have liked.  Maybe if they spaced it out better?\n\nOur waiter was friendly, although I did have to look for him a few times for refills, boxes, etc.\n\nIn total, most of the food was good and would probably have me interested in dining there again.

Sure, I heard a few good things here and there, and the reviews just sounded too good to be true.  Finally, after referring someone else on Yelp to this place, I figure I had to go see for myself.\n\nFor $26.95/pp, it's all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi...with pretty much no restrictions.  Now this is what makes Hikari very special.  Other restaurants usually limit you on one order of uni, amaebi, and hamachi collar per person.  Not here.  You get to order an unlimited amount, even without rice!  Yes, without rice I say!  \n\nSince the sushi bar was full, we sat at one of those teppanyaki tables and ordered off their sushi menu.  The waitress (all the staff were young and native Japanese speakers) took our beverage orders and was ready to get started with our sushi orders.  When I inquired about the sashimi, she said I could get whatever they had as sashimi instead of nigiri.  And that's pretty much what we ended up ordering all night.  Sure, they don't have a bunch of fancy rolls to choose from, but that's not why I'm here anyway.\n\nThis is what we did get: \n\n* Agedashi Tofu\n* Soft Shell Crab Appetizer\n* Sashimi Combination\n* Oysters on the Half Shell\n* Maguro Sashimi\n* Hamachi Sashimi\n* Super White Tuna Sashimi\n* Seared Albacore\n* White Fish Sashimi\n* Sake Sashimi\n* Saba Sashimi\n* Amaebi Sashimi (including the deep-fried heads)\n* Ikura\n* Uni\n* Ika\n* Salmon Skin Hand Roll (with rice and without the rice)\n* Miso Soup\n\nThe only really bad food choices we made were the seared albacore and the saba.  The albacore and saba weren't that fresh, a bit tough and just not good.  Avoid! \n\nThe Big F really enjoyed their salmon skin hand rolls (sans the rice), having at least four all to himself!  I really enjoyed all the uni, ikura, and oysters on the half shell myself.  \n\nSure, they don't offer dessert as part of the AYCE as the other places do.  But I'll skip some mochi ice cream for more uni or sashimi!\n\nService was good for the most part.  Our waitress came by often to see if we wanted more food.  There's a lot of staff here, and they are more than willing to help.  I did have to ask for my tea to be refilled all the time, so I wish they came by with the teapot more often.  (Next time I'll just ask for a teapot of my own.)  And it didn't take long at all for our food to arrive.  We barely had any waiting time in between each order.\n\nThey do offer Teppanyaki dinners that include Japanese Onion Soup, Salad, Shrimp Appetizer, Fried Rice, and Combination Vegetables along with your entree choice.  There are a couple of kid choices too.  \n\nGratuity of 18% will be added for parties of 4 or more.\n\nThey are even open until 2 am, last call being at 1:30 am.  And ladies seated after 11 pm, get a discount at $22.50/pp.\n\nWe'll be back for sure!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bB1bVvOMkfvWFVbNmRl_VA"}

Sure, they don't pretty it up on a plate or anything, but rather just toss it onto a plate.  And sometimes the cuts can be pretty bad where you can't even chew the fish up.  Then again, it can depend on who is cutting up your fish.  \n\nService has been better.  On one of the last times we went, the sushi chefs were rushing us to order, but we were still waiting for a friend.  (And there was no one waiting for our seats.)  And when we were ready to order, they were either watching TV or spacing out.  Orders were forgotten and had to repeated.

And finally, the answer is yes.\n\nShowing up there on a Sunday night around 6:45 pm without reservations is a daring move, especially with a party of four.  Sure, my wait was about 30-45 minutes, but trust me, I tried to make reservations.  I was calling all evening before they opened and got a busy signal!\n\nWhen we finally got seated right smack in the middle, I had plenty of time to read a few reviews, check out their many newspaper/magazine features, and observe my fellow diners.\n\nIt took awhile before the waiter took our order, meanwhile I was in search of a wine list.  (I had read about their incredible beverage menu, but was disappointed when none was given to me.)  When I did ask for wine menu, it's more like a wine book!  I think they should have automatically offered us the beverage menu.\n\nOur menu:   \n\n* Stuffed Chicken Wings $8.95 (Chicken wings stuffed with ground pork, deep fried, and served with sweet and sour sauce.)  This came with two chicken wings that were sliced for sharing.  Tasty and full of flavor, a bit disappointing though with the small portion.\n\n* Mee Krob $7.95 (Crispy noodle mixed with sweet and sour sauce, chicken and shrimp.)  I wasn't sure what to expect with this dish, but what a nice surprise.  The crispy noodles had a nice freshness to it and very good.  Would definitely order it again!\n\n* Tom Klong Pla-Krob, Hot Pot $15.95 (This unique soup was influenced by mixed Thai-Cambodian culture which combined pieces of \"smoked sheet fish\" with the Thai-Cambodian style soup, seasoned with tamarind sauce, fresh herb, spices, chili.)  This soup comes out beautifully presented and has a huge wow factor.  There's so much spice and flavor in this soup and has your mouth humming from all the heat.\n\n* Pork Panang $9.95 (The color and flavor of fresh & dried chili makes this curry a unique dish.  Cooked with coconut milk, Thai basil and chili.)  I was craving some kind of Thai curry with a coconut milk base and the pork was surprisingly tender.  The sauce went fabulous with my rice.\n\n* Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) $8.95 (If you like Louisiana style hot sausage, you have got to try this one.  Stuffed with ground pork, fresh and dried her and spice, this mild/medium spicy sausage is indeed very tasty.)  A bit dry and disappointing for us all. It lacked the spice and flavor we had hoped for.\n\n* Crispy Duck with Chu-Chee $19.95 (Topped with Thai red curry base sauce.)  The three guys I was dining with absolutely LOVED this dish and were practically fighting over it!  It tasted so good for them that they ordered another one!  There's a chunky portion of duck fat sitting under the skin, which is what I think makes it taste so good. The curry sauce is fabulous complement to this dish.\n \n* Crispy Mussel Omelet $8.95 (Fried Thai mussel omelet to crispy on top of sauteed bean spout and green onion and served with spicy sweet sauce.)  It's more like a deep-fried dish, which surprised us all.      It has a weird texture because of the dryness of the deep-frying and the mushiness of the mussels and egg base.\n\n* Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves $19.95 (Topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil.)  The duck was good again, but the guys preferred the Chu-Chee sauce instead.  I liked the Thai basil myself.  \n\nEntrees come with steamed rice, but you can get sticky rice for $1.50/pp.  \n\nService - Our water glasses were never refilled and the woman clearing our dishes made it very clear to us that she wanted us to leave.  She not only said it under her breath, but again later on while I was using the restroom.  We weren't done with our beverages yet and I felt rushed to leave.  However, the waiters were nicer, asking us if we wanted dessert before giving us our bill.  (We were stuffed with a few leftovers not worth taking.)\n\nOverall, Lotus of Siam has a VERY extensive menu.  There's such a huge variety that it'll make you want to come back so you can try other things.  The waiter never asked us about our spice level, and we told him about a 6-7.  The only thing spicy was the soup, everything else fell short on spiciness.  Definitely go with a bigger group so you can order more dishes.  With so many accolades, they could do a lot better on service.  It gives you a casual feel with the paper napkins and buffet set up in the middle.  For the most part, the food is very good and tasty.  You'll probably find us back here so we can check out their other stuff.  I'll definitely make reservations though!\n\n(You can check out photos of our dinner in the business profile section!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

After our first visit  many years ago, I figured it would be a nice treat to go back.\n\nAfter making reservations for a Thursday evening, they told us they would only hold the reservation for 5 minutes because they are that busy.  Okay.\n\nWe were a party of six - four adults and two kids.  \n\n* Chicken Dumplings ($6.95) -   Basic deep fried wontons with chicken and vegetables and served with a sweet chili sauce.  This order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies.\n\n* Our friend recently had a Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad ($13.95) at another Thai place and wanted to try their version.  When he saw the presentation, he was immediately disappointed.  The pieces were a bit larger than he would have hoped and it was just an okay salad taste-wise.\n\n* The Husband was certain about one dish in particular - the Crispy Duck Curry.  (He loved it before and that's all he could remember.)  When the waiter heard this, he insisted we order the Crispy Panang Curry instead and assured us we would LOVE it.  (It also cost $20.95.)  I asked him if he was certain we really would and he said yes.  We thought it was just alright...and not really worth the $21 cost of it especially.  Sure, it was tasty but I've had better panang curry in Vegas for a fraction of the price.\n\n* We also opted for something from the Chef Specials - the Red Snapper.  Sure, it was a whole snapper at market price, which ended up being $35.  Our friend couldn't believe it when he discovered how much they charged for it.\n\nWhen the waiter initially took our order, he asked what our spice level choice was.  We wanted the salad and curry mild since the kids would be eating it.  However, it was far from mild and we were unable to serve it to the children.  As we neared the conclusion of our meal, we wanted to add another dish.  We asked the waiter for some suggestion and he mostly focused on things from the Chef Specials that were market price or didn't appeal to us.  We ultimately decided we were done with the meal.  \n\nI did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hoping for a saving grace but there was nothing exciting on there and our visiting friends were done with their Lotus experience at this point.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing visit.  Sure, they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leaves us wanting more. Maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes?

He started mixing a couple of vodkas together and poured his concoction into a martini glass.  He added a fresh raspberry and blueberry to my drink and I took a sip. Yum!  My bf had a classic martini himself.  \n\nWe perused over the menu and although I was tempted by the caviar, I had to say no.  I was still full from my huge meal upstairs. \n\nWe were then invited to the vault.  Putting on the crazy hats and the crazy coats, we proceeded into this ice chamber for a shot of vodka.

Ask him to make something special for you! \n\nOverall, for the brief time I was at Red Square, I had such an interesting night.

What a decadent treat!  \n\nI enjoyed a mixed concoction of vodka and a bunch of fruity stuff.  The BF and another friend had their vodka straight up.  The real winner was their Russian Mary!  My oh my and what yum!  This mix has been sitting around for a little while and has some serious hotness to it.

Not sure if it was because it sat out too long as they piled the dish together and added the aioli or what.  The potatoes were really good though, and the aioli went quite nicely with it overall.

Their menu sounded interestingly enough as this one restaurant ended up being our only visit during RW.  What makes their RW menu a bit different from others is that they were offering a four course meal for $50.13 versus a three course.\n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday with reservations in hand.  This was a good thing because they were especially busy this night with lots of events going on at MGM.  We were advised that service would take longer than usual because of how busy things were.  We appreciated the upfront warning.\n\nOur menu choices:\n\n* Heirloom Tomato Salad \"Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil and Aged Balsamic\" - A bit disappointing.  The tomatoes were rather mushy, as in possibly overripe.  We usually love heirloom tomatoes, but we weren't loving this one.\n\n* Cold Smoked Salmon Tartare \"Crispy Flatbread, Whole Grain Mustard Aioli and Watercress\" - I'm afraid to say this, but it was underseasoned.  Yes, that's right.  Even with the freshly ground pepper, it just was blah.  I had to add salt and more pepper to wake up the dish.  The aioli was minimal, so it didn't really do much to enhance the fish at all.\n\n* Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder \"Apple Wood Smoked Bacon & Potato\" - This soup was rich, hearty, and very flavorful.  It was one really good bowl of clam chowder soup.\n\n* Chicken, Shrimp, & Andouille Gumbo \"Long Grain Rice & Shaved Green Onion\" - This was some pretty good gumbo.  It had so much going on in terms of yummy goodness and a deep developed flavor.  We were very impressed.  (We recently had gumbo at another fine dining establishment and let's say their version does not come close to Emeril's.)\n\n* Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop \"Chive & Potato Puree, Fresh Pea Tendrils and Toy Box Charm Tomatoes\" - This was a very generous portion of protein after our first two dishes. It had a very tasty crust and probably should have been enjoyed during this seating.  It was just too much for myself and I had to take the rest to go.  The Husband made the mistake of eating the whole thing and couldn't eat much dessert after.  (His loss.)  The fresh pea tendrils literally looks like they just cut it from the garden.  It doesn't really do much to the dish beyond adding color.\n\n* New Orleans Bread & Butter Bread Pudding - I normally don't  order bread pudding but theirs is pretty good.  I was already so stuffed but couldn't stop eating it.\n\n* Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - Another dessert that I don't usually choose, but it's pretty good too!  It was fluffy and creamy, not overly chunky or heavy.  I think that's what we both liked - two desserts that we don't normally like but really enjoyed here.\n\nService was good overall.  Water glasses were filled and the staff were constantly moving.  Sure, there were some hit and misses throughout our meal, but it started off weak and built itself up and ended strong.

Sure, it's pretty generous sandwich because they really do load it up with veggies, so you'll get your fill on the vegetarian burger.  The fried zucchini was pretty standard, crispy and not soggy at all.\n\nThe Husband had the American Kobe Beef Burger ($16.50), straight up.  They ask if you want to add various fillings like cheese, mushrooms, etc.  But he stuck to just the beef so he could taste the meat itself.  It was decent, but nothing special or worth the price.  (I guess what makes this place special is all the toppings you can add - 8 different kinds of cheese, lobster or shrimp, foie gras, chili, black truffles, or three different sauces.

I'm not so sure it's a good one though.  I expected to leave the showing feeling sensual, hot, and ready to pounce on my boyfriend when I got home.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.\n\nThis show relies heavily on audience participation.  If you bought one of the more expensive seats in the front, be prepared to have the spotlight shown on you.  Yes, there's a small sign before you enter the theater warning you that you may be asked to participate and you can always decline, but when you have everyone clapping and cheering you on, you don't want to be the dud that says no.\n\nThe show bounces quickly from a hot and heavy sequence that can leave you breathing a bit deeper, but before you can even enjoy this feeling for a bit longer, it jumps quickly to their version of commercials.  Yes, their sideshows are humorous and make up a huge portion of the show.  But you'd think the way Zumanity was advertised, this would play a secondary role in this show.  It dominated it ours.\n\nThere are some talented individuals in this performance, and some interesting and costumes (or lack of).  The stage is pretty small compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows though.  \n\nI sat in section 203, which was a pretty good section.  It wasn't too close for the expensive costs, but close enough for you not to notice the difference.  And it wasn't so far back or up high that you felt like you were in the cheap seats.\n\nOverall, it was okay for a Cirque du Soleil show.  Maybe I just expected more and was disappointed.\n\nRankings thus far:\n1) Cirque du Soleil's O\n2) Cirque du Soleil's Ka\n3) Cirque du Soleil's Mystere\n4) Cirque du Soleil's Zumanity\n5) Dragone's Le Reve", "type": "review", "business_id": "m7icEOgYpM3B8TlbYsKPzg"}

Finally, a chance to take advantage of it! \n\nWe chose a table outside so we could people watch, but we ended being the ones to watch!\n\nTheir current promotion is the Classic Summer Lobster Dinner for 2.  So what does that mean?  For $89.95, you get a four pound Jumbo Nova Scotia Lobster, split for two.  It's served with a choice of a mixed green or Caesar salad (or soup of the day), and one Signature side dish.\n\nA glance at the neighboring table and you can't help but want one for yourself.  So what was supposed to be a birthday lunch ended being a heavy early birthday dinner! \n\nThey start you off with bread and butter and we chose their soup of the day, which was Cream of Mushroom. \n\nWith bibs on, our lobster arrived - and what a sight it was.  The tomalley, aka lobster liver, oozes out onto the platter.  The waitstaff artfully removes the meat from the giant claws with a break and a pull.  We immediately start digging in and it doesn't take long to enjoy the fatty rich taste of this delicacy.  As I get started on my tail portion, I'm in need of some drawn butter to give it some added fatty richness!  (This the part where pedestrians can't help but point at what you're eating!  A four pound lobster is huge and it's an easy sell for the restaurant for those dining outside with it!) \n\nThe Wild Mushrooms, our side dish, is a nice medley and cooked in more butter!  This lunch is heavily loaded!\n\nAs we finish our last few bits, I am stuffed!  \n\nBut...the Husband has informed the staff that it's my birthday and out the staff comes to sing me a song and present me with a complimentary birthday cheesecake!  It was rich and pretty good!  Yum!    \n\nService was good - we had a leisurely lunch and the staff were professional.  There was a slight gap when we needed to wave down someone for more water, a napkin, etc. \n\nThey do offer their 837 Club where a $25 enrollment fee will give you a $25 gift certificate for the restaurant and you can earn points towards free meals, etc.\n\nUltimately, when it comes down to it, I love the Husband's version of lobster more.  Sure, theirs was good - but his homecooked version has me wanting more.  Therefore, we probably won't be back for their lobster special, but eventually will get around to trying their $23.95 three course business lunch!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5IWu0xhlZEopvIz3w7o_3w"}

So, we decide to sit inside, but as we are headed out, I notice a handful of people sitting in the blazing heat and we decide to go for it.  Smack dab in the middle of the patio and perfect for people-watching!\n\nIt's a quick peek at the menu and we're set to go!  Waters arrive shortly, along with warm French baguettes and butter.  The bread and butter is SO good, and just so French!  Yum!\n\nOur food soon arrives:\n* Mussels Mariniere with frites ($21.95 full order) - Loaded with tons of onions, we start digging in.  One of my favorite things about eating mussels is the yummy sauce that comes with it, perfect for dipping warm French bread into!  What I don't like is finding the beard still attached to the mussel.  Sure, I can let one go.  But there were at least four mussels were I was spitting the beard out.  Yuck.  The frites are usually one of my favorite parts too, but I wasn't digging their version here.  It's more like deep-fried potato sticks\n\n  * County Style Pate \"cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast\" ($9.95) - The pate was just okay, nothing spectacular.  You take a piece of pate and put it on the country bread, and take a bite.  Have a cornichon too while you're at it.  But it wasn't something that transported me back to the French countryside.\n\nOur waiter also forgot The Husband's Kronenbourg, which required a bit of reminding.\n\nService was good in the beginning with our water glass being filled often and more baguettes coming our way.  Then I think there was a shift change because all of sudden we were forgotten about and we had to wave the staff down for more water and our check.  We also noticed that we didn't get any kind of dipping sauce for our frites, but noticed other tables automatically got ketchup.  I would have been happy with mayo!\n\nOverall, I guess I was expecting more - from the service and the food.  Everyone raves about this place, and I was left feeling underwhelmed.

The feta croutons were especially good, although I didn't taste any togarashi in my salad.\n\nEntree\n\n* Chilled Rare Tuna Nicoise \"haricot vert, heirloom tomato, cornichon, smoked hard boiled egg, nicoise olives, champagne vinaigrette\" - Tuna seared perfectly to a beautiful color and the smoked hard boiled egg added a nice taste against the green beans and salad.\n\n* Char Grilled Lamb Chop \"fattoush salad, za'atar spiced pita chips, minted feta, pine nut vinaigrette\" - Two nice sized lamb chops rested on a bed of lettuce.

(The spatzle does come with other entrees though.)  \n\nThe BF got the Hofbrauhaus Platte which is a decent combination of just about everything - \"Smoked Pork Loin, Pork Roast, smoked sausage, Dark Beer sauce, Sauerkraut, and Mashed Potatoes.\"  The sausage was pretty good, but the pork loin reminded me of corned beef (the kind you serve on with cabbage).  The pork roast was a bit dry for me, but the BF ate it all up.  A good helping of sauerkraut helps this go down easily.\n\nOur friend also ordered this sausage dish that had his wieners sitting in a water bath when it arrived in a big ole bowl.  Slather on the sweet mustard and it's pretty grub!  \n\nOf course, you have to wash this down with some beer - a liter size mug if you can hang.  (I cannot.)  Check to see if they have any seasonal specials because it's worth ordering those instead.  (And be sure to read that newspaper they leave for you when you get the menu, sometimes the specials are listed there instead.)\n\nHofbrauhaus is the kind of place you go with friends - the more, the merrier.  It gets loud and crazy and the service is good.  Waitresses and servers are busy, keeping your beverages full and your bellies happy.  (You'll see people from all ages here - toddlers even!)

Everyone in your party is bound to be happy, and that's the good thing.  \n\nThe question always remains though, did I eat my money's worth?  And sometimes you do, and sometimes you don't.

I've seen many of Cirque du Soleil's traveling shows, only to realize you can watch the whole performance on TV too.  Nonetheless, I've heard my share of good and bad things about Mystere and wanted to see it all for myself.  (And how can I ever say no to a date with the BF anyway?)\n\nUpon walking into the theatre, it was grand. I was excited.  Our seats were superb, section 203 right smack in the middle, not too close and not too far back.  I couldn't have chosen better seats.  \n\nThe opening act got me excited, I could only hope for more.  Some of their costumes were spectacular, and they only enhanced each acrobat as well.  I was in awe of their overall image, from all the visual displays from each side of the theatre to what was going on above and below.  The lighting effects were fabulous too!\n\nI think the clown acts were a bit overdone and although some were funny, it was okay.  With this being the first permanent Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas, you have to be impressed with the creativity behind the show and the design of the stage.  But after seeing some of other shows in Vegas, it can be disappointing.  Some of the acrobatics and feats of strength are nothing to be wowed by if you have seen others.    \n\nThe cool thing about Mystere's show is that you feel like you're in a movie theatre with your popcorn and soda.  It gives it a much more casual feel.  But like Lex G. said, I too kept on dropping popcorn down my cleavage and I think the BF was distracted by that during most of the show.\n\nI was disappointed in the ending.  I looked over at the BF and asked if it was over.  I didn't experience the visual orgasm like Rick H. talked about, but then again, maybe I've had better orgasms.  I didn't get the snail.  I expected more and felt the last act wasn't strong enough to leave you feeling breathless.  \n\nIt was a decent show overall.  It will be fabulous if it's your first time ever seeing a show like this, but disappointing if you have experienced the other Cirque du Soleil or Dragone wonders.  \n\nMy ratings so far on these Vegas shows:\n\n1) Cirque du Soleil's O\n2) Cirque du Soleil's Mystere\n3) Dragone's Le Reve\n\nThe BF said this show was better than Cirque du Soleil's Beatles LOVE show.

However, we only sampled ice cream during our first visit so I'm not really counting that time.\n\nAfter getting our orders in, cornbread and biscuits arrived and they were so yum! We devoured them and they asked us if we wanted more.  Of course!  The second batch wasn't quite as good though.\n\nFirst Course:\n*  California Roll \"King Crab, Avocado, Cucumber, Sesame Seed\" - Normally, I wouldn't be ordering CA roll and it's probably because I'm a bit of  sushi snob.  But since they did advertise King crab and the waitress recommended it, we felt like we should.  You definitely see the chunks of crab in this roll, but the seaweed was definitely chewy in not a good way.  If you attempted to bite into the piece, you either have to avoid the seaweed on the first bite or take it all in.\n\n* Rick's White Clam Chowder \"Potatoes, Littleneck Clams, Bacon\" - I definitely got the chunks of potatoes and clams, but didn't really taste the bacon in there.  There was also a strong taste in there that wasn't particularly my favorite part of it, the Husband said it was wine.\n\nSecond Course:\n* Wagyu Hanger Steak \"Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Red Wine Jus\" - We were amazed with the generous portion of this steak and they had cooked it perfectly rare.  It was damn beautiful.  The mashed potatoes had chunks of lobster tail and claw meat throughout which surprised us both.  That was one delicious entree and a winner!\n\n* Diver Scallops \"Roasted Cauliflower, Toasted Almonds, Drunken Raisins\" - Three perfectly cooked scallops with citrus peels and raisins that added a lovely and surprisingly sweetness to the scallops.  It was a really nice dish.  My only complaint would be that I wish there was a bit more sauce for my scallops.  But I would definitely order the scallops again!\n\nThird Course:\n* Nutella Creme Brulee \"Toasted Hazlenuts, Carmelized Banana\" - This was a nice size dessert course, although we were disappointed that the creme brulee wasn't warm.  Although we ordered two creme brulees, a key lime pie ended up on our table.  We let the server know immediately that wasn't ours and they took it away and brought out another creme brulee shortly.  When our waitress brought our check, we think she may have taken the Husband's dessert before he was completely finished.  It was only a couple more bites, but when he realized it was gone, he was a bit disappointed.\n\nOverall, service was good.  The waitress was smart about bringing utensils for both of us for everything, assuming we were sharing and we were.  I had asked her about the ice cream sampler and she had mentioned she would bring the dessert menu by at the end of our meal.  She obviously forgot, as did I.  The amount of food in this prix fixe is generous.  We were hurting for sure.  The oyster menu and its descriptions sound fabulous and definitely had me curious about them all. We were seated in the outer part of the restaurant, so I could still smell the cigarette smoke from the casino.  If this is a concern, it's probably best to be seated further inside the restaurant.  I would definitely return and order the steak and scallops for sure!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ggoYlZeQhATwb_yGSntfdw"}

While enjoying the view, you also meet the most interesting of people who are happy to invite you to party with them, and I do mean 'party' in all ways Vegas can be interpreted.\n\nThe music was okay, and the crowd was interesting.  There was a variety of people, in terms of age and genre.  I can't say the same about the ethnic card though as there wasn't such a diversity at all.  We checked out some of the smaller rooms and danced a bit.  I wasn't too impressed by the cow who tripped over her drunk self while apparently trying to dance sexy and in the process stuck her heel into my foot. (And of course, I was wearing open-toed shoes.)  It wouldn't have been so bad if she apologized or excused herself, but she was so drunk and embarrassing that the guys around her were having a 'good' time with her.  Odds were they were both trying to figure out who gets to take her home 'cuz you know she was going to go home with someone, it was just a matter of who.  (If I were them, they both should have negotiated and both gone with her!)  \n\nThe ladies' room gets crowded as everyone is in there fixing their make-up and you're bound to find someone, anyone kicking back with the restroom attendant.  I wasn't sure if it was a guest or a cocktail waitress, either way, she was just sitting in there chatting it up all night long. \n\nIt's not that crowded on a Saturday night because you do need to be on the list or a member.

This part isn't so nice.  \nThey make you exit out this side door though, which is a bit annoying.\n\nOverall, Tangerine is a small club.  Not as glamorous as some of the other clubs on the strip.

Located right on the strip, take a seat outside so you can enjoy the constant changing screens of the Wynn Hotel and, of course, people watch.\n\nLate lunch and we order the Traditional Gazpacho Soup (gazpacho tradicional); the Beef Tenderloin Toro Brocheta (parsley garlic oil brocheta de solomillo); and the White Anchovies, Avocado & Peppers (boquerones con aguacate).  We attempted to order the Fried Green Peppers & Coarse Salt (pimientos fritos), but they were out already.  \n\nThe Gazpacho was light and cooling.  When brought to your table, you can choose if you want a few toppings added to it or not.  The anchovies were very tasty.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough anchovies and too much of the avocado stuff instead.  The toro brocheta was especially enhanced by the tasty green sauce that accompanied it.  (My dining companion was surprised that they didn't ask us how we wanted our beef.)  Without the sauce, it would be a bit dry.  The sauce really gave it a punch.  (I requested more so I could dunk my bread in it.)\n \nDessert - we ordered the Banana (caramelized banana, vanilla ice cream aka platano al caramelo); the Strawberries (sour cream foam aka fresa con espuma de crema); and the Chocolate (white chocolate soup aka sopa de chocolate blanco).  With these desserts only be $1.99, you don't feel bad ordering a bunch of them.  Then again, they are super small.  Big enough to share with one other person only if you order more than one.  The Banana was nicely caramelized with caramel sauce and cooling ice cream.  The Strawberries were a bit too tart for me, and tasted much better when mixed with the Chocolate dish.  I think the idea of a white chocolate soup is divine.  With little rice crispies on the top and tiny pieces of pineapple on the bottom, it's a refreshing dessert.  (Was there a hint of coconut in it?)\n\nOverall, with my limited dining experience at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, I would give it only three stars.  It was a decent place for tapas, but not extraordinary.  Portion sizes are on the smaller end and I would hate to think of trying to share my sardines or gazpacho dish with more than one dining companion.\n\nI did particularly enjoy just sitting out front and enjoying my leisurely lunch on the strip.  Having such late lunches, there are no crowds to deal with and you can enjoy yourself so much more.

It's not hard to fill up your plate with just salad alone.\n\nIf you ever venture past the salad bar, you'll find a few varieties of soup (chicken noodle, tomato soup, french onion, etc.) and chili, a make your own baked potato section, a few selections of focaccia breads, cornbread, and even the pasta bar.  (Their mac n' cheese reminds me of the Kraft in the box variety, which I actually really like!)\n\nWhen you're ready to satisfy your sweet tooth, they have chocolate pudding, fresh fruit, sundae bar, and rice pudding.

You can even make your own coffee with a shot of something or other and chocolate milk with syrup! \n\nThey claim that everything is made from scratch, which definitely impresses me and I wish I could take a look into their kitchen to see if they are really are brewing up chicken stock!

Well, she was correct to ask as there was a time limit on the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi option.  (I had yet to have ever experienced an All You Can Eat place that had restrictions on time, and this apparently was going to be my first.  Were they going to be put a timer on the table?)  \n\nTheir menu selection is quite large and ranges from appetizers, to nigiri, to dessert even!  There are a few items that you are limited to (2 per person) and there were out of a few 'hot' items on a Saturday night.  We were told there might be a wait, but there actually was none.  We sat at the sushi bar so we could order directly from the sushi chefs.  Quite a few other patrons and the sushi chefs commented on how surprisingly slow it was that evening.  Despite the slow night, the chefs were too busy watching TV to pay much attention to the customers and we felt like we had to wave them down to get their attention.    \n\nThe food was okay - there were some good rolls and some alright items.  I recall not wanting to finish some cooked fish appetizer I ordered.  It wasn't all that great.  The spicy tuna roll wasn't up to par with what I had in mind.\n\nService was okay.  I think one of the waitresses didn't understand English very well, so she had to get her colleague to help us out a lot.  We were a little offended when we ordered our dessert and they returned with the check as well.  (Uh, we weren't done yet, and our hour wasn't up yet either.) \n\nOverall, I felt rushed watching my 'hour' time limit.  I think we paid about $25 each for this All You Can Eat but figured it was a good deal.  After all, once you order a couple of rolls and nigiri, you've spent that much money already.  If All You Can Eat Sushi is what you want, Sushi Mon will give that to you. And with the various choices from hot and cold items, it gives you a bigger range to choose from.  \n\nCan't beat mochi and/or ice cream for dessert either!   \n\nIt also says on their website that they are open until 2 am!

Limited items on the all-you-can-eat is the Toro, Amaebi, Uni, Baked Oyster, and Sake Shooter.  They only have two ice cream flavors - Green Tea and something else, and only Strawberry Mochi.  The BF and the brother loved the Baked Mussels.  They also offer amaebi head soup, which is a nice twist.  Nigiri was pretty good with good slices of fish and small amounts of rice.

The cool thing about coming around this time is that you pay the lunch price, but the dinner food starts coming out.

Going early is definitely worth it then for those reasons! \n\nLike Caroline C. said, the interior reminds you of a Martha Stewart wedding with the pastel colors, flowers, and fake fruit displays.  Not only do they have a long list of food to choose from, but they present it pretty nicely too.  And the descriptions sound a lot better as well.  They know that visual presentation helps with selling the food here!  You definitely don't see this style of buffet at the other casinos! \n\nHighlights when I went were the snow crab legs and drawn butter, ravioli in mushroom cream sauce, various toppings for their ice cream, and the creme brulee.  \n\nService was okay.  There was a shift change when we arrived (Jesus greeted us, but Chris took over right away), so I think the person taking over our table overlooked us.  Beverages were only refilled when asked and dirty dishes were never cleared unless requested.

It's Service Industry Night (S.I.N.), and they have food and drink specials from 8 pm to midnight.  It's crowded by the bar, and the restaurant is still hopping.  Grab a drink and take a seat outside if you want to chitchat or in my case last night, sit under the heating lamp to stay warm.  A lot of locals hang out there despite it being on the strip.  Located in Fashion Show Mall, it can carry a crowd depending on the night.  As of late, they were advertising Reggae Nights and 80s Nights.  You'll find a small dance floor and if the DJ is spinning out some good tunes, it'll be too crowded for you to bust a move.  But that's okay, there are some good-looking people here that are worth watching out for.\n\nWhen I leave Ra, I see red...\n\nMaybe someday I'll come by and try out their happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm on weekdays.  Or just swing by during their regular hours and have a taste of their Signature Sushi.\n\nUpdate! 03/19/08 - Why do I always find myself here on Sunday nights?  This time I had a chance to sit down and try the food.  We lucked out with a party of ten at 11:30 pm with no reservations.  We only had to wait about ten minutes to grab a table.  \n\nI took advantage of their SIN food specials and got the Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($3.25), the Spicy Tuna Roll ($3.75), and the Scallop Dynamite ($3.50).  There's nothing special about these rolls, they use Sriracha  to make it spicy, and it's not one of my favorite ways to do it.  We thought the Scallop Dynamite was going to be a roll, but it's actually scallops and Asian mushrooms baked in their 'Dynamite' sauce.  It's pretty tasty, and the BF was eating up all the onions that came along with it.\n\nI also tried their Coconut Shrimp Tempura ($3.75).  It comes with about four deep fried shrimps on skewers with a roasted pineapple dipping sauce.  It's probably best to eat them while their hot, it was okay by the time I got to them.  \n\nThe really great thing about their SIN drink specials is the $1.00 Warm Sakes.  However, they ran out of Sake flasks (tokkuris)!  The waitress arrived with our sake in wide rimmed glasses which pretty much defeats the purpose of the flask which is to prevent the heat from escaping!  They also ran out of sake cups (ochokos), so we asked for shot glasses.  She was completely out of that as well!  She did apologize profusely and it appeared she actually went around to look.  They just didn't have enough people cleaning up the tables and washing the dishes.  (I personally think it's a management problem and they should be used to their busy Sunday nights and sake drinking crowds.  Running out of tokkuris and ochokos really is unacceptable.)  As a result, I brought their rating from a four to a three.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Lq6CDJ2yHmMs4N7jscQhHQ"}

(In retrospect, I wish I had asked for a seat in the 'outside' area so we could have access to the pedestrian area.  The front room we were seated in reminded me of someone's dining room.  After taking our orders and getting our beverages, hot bread rolls and cold butter arrived a few minutes later.\n\nStarter:\n* Onion Soup Gratinee \"Baguette, Gruyere cheese\" - The Husband and I both chose this dish to start, since the other options were both salads.  The cheesy goodness from the Gruyere cheese really makes this dish.  Otherwise it's just onions and bread in a broth.\n\nEntree:\n* Croque Monsieur \"Ham, Gruyere cheese, Creme Fraiche\" - This is what I had initially ordered.  But the neighboring table got an order of the Linguini Pasta and I could smell the wonderful garlic scent rising from her dish.  I was immediately enchanted and wished to change my order.  (Thank goodness it was before the soup had arrived, so the waitress was able to make the change.)\n\n* Linguini Pasta \"Mussels, Littleneck Clams, white wine broth\" - When the waiter placed the dish in front of me, I waited for the steam bath of garlic to envelope me.  It didn't.  I took a big whiff and I could hardly smell any garlic.  It also looked a bit less than that neighboring party's dish.  Hmmm...As I started to separate the mussels and clams from their shells, I took a bite of my pasta.  Pretty heavy on the white wine broth and not much else is what my final thoughts were.  I found myself putting pats of butter into the dish to give it more flavor.  It was just okay, not something I would order again.\n\n* Roasted Chicken \"Tarragon-sherry jus, Pinot Garlic Fries\" - A generous portion size for lunch, I was surprised that The Husband went this route since we're not fond of the dry chicken problem.  He really thought it would be different here.  The chicken laid on a bed of mushrooms which had a heavy wine sauce.  In the end, the chicken was dry, especially the breast section.  (He learned his lesson.)  The side of fries were good, although we had to ask for a dipping sauce.\n\nDessert:\n* Chocolate Croissant Pudding \"With Wild Turkey Sauce\" - Unfortunately, they were already out of this dessert by 1 pm.\n\n* Creme Brulee \"Burnt custard\" - Dessert took awhile, and at least it was worth waiting for.  They do their creme brulee very nicely here.  A large service area for the burnt sugary top, a nice texture and taste, and a satisfying dessert overall.\n\nService was decent, nothing exceptional though.  Things took a lot longer than we felt necessary, and I'm not sure if it's because they purposely want you to have a leisurely meal or if they just run slower.  I did notice that not everyone was offered the Restaurant Week lunch menu option, which does make me wonder why.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KJK7ihnpTeHXOy9rxORpGQ"}

Walking upstairs at the Hawaiian marketplace, you'll be surprised to see this dimly lit restaurant and its ample seating area.  They offer a buffet lunch and dinner a la carte.\n\nIt's hard when you want to try a bunch of different stuff when it's just you and the BF.  But Tamba offers a couple of 'feasts' to help satisfy that curiosity!\n\nFor $25, the BF got the Ashoka's Feast which comes with:\n\n* Tandoori Chicken \"Spring chicken in a mildly spiced ginger yogurt sauce.\" - It came with two drumsticks and two breasts, a decent amount to start his meal.  There were three dipping sauces - the mint one, a chutney of some sort, and a dark purplish one.  I'm not a particular big fan of tandoori, but the BF ate three pieces of it.\n\n* Lamb Curry \"Cubes of lamb cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic, red chilies, and pickling spices.\" - It tasted a bit gamey for me, but we did enjoy dipping our nan bread into the sauce.\n\n* Chicken Tikka Masala \"Chunks of boneless chicken roasted in the clay oven and then served in a mild curry sauce.\" - The chicken was white meat, and pretty flavorless.  But the curry sauce was SO good!  I wish I had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan bread with!  Next time I'll tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce!\n\n* Kali Dal \"Slow cooked black lentils with a medley of spices.\" The BF thought this would taste just fabulous in a burrito, as in skip the black beans, refried beans, or pinto, and add some black lentils instead.  Pretty tasty stuff and good with the nan bread too.\n\n* Rice - A generous scoop coupled with a few green peas for decoration.  Needed to enjoy all the lovely sauces the meal has to offer.\n\n* Nan \"White flour tandoori bread\" - A must when eating Indian food.  My preferred choice when soaking up any kind of curries, especially those that come with tikka masalas! \n\n* Raita - Condiment based on yogurt used as a sauce or dip.  Served chilled and has a cooling effect when eating spicy dishes.  I'm not a big fan of the raita and was only dumping it on the rice 'cuz the BF was doing it.  I can pass on this.  \n\n* Daily Dessert - Two small donut-like holes sitting in a bath of butter and honey.  Oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearty Indian dinner.\n\nI ordered up the Buddha's Feast for $21 and this is what I got: \n\n* Vegetable Samosa \"Crisp golden brown pastries stuffed with mildly seasoned potatoes and peas.\" - The order came with two samosas, and two dipping sauces.  The BF was pretty impressed by these, and I'm lucky that I had two to share!\n\n* Malai Kofta \"Chunks of cheese tossed in a mild buttery cream sauce.\" - It came with one chunk of cheese only, which I couldn't even tell was cheese! I thought it was a mixture of chickpeas or something.  The sauce was okay, and good for dipping. \n\n* Saag Paneer \"Spinach with our special cottage cheese cooked in a karahi with house spices.\" - It came with one piece of cottage cheese, and I think it lacked flavor.  The BF said it had been sitting out too long and this is one of his favorite Indian dishes.\n\n* Kali Dal\n\n* Rice\n\n* Nan\n\n* Raita\n\n* Daily Dessert\n\nThe feasts are presented quite nicely on a large platter and it's a decent amount of food.  You definitely get the chance to taste a few different things without breaking the budget or ordering too much food.\n\nThe BF also ordered a Mango Lassi that he found a bit too sweet for his liking.  I thought it tasted fine, but was more watery than what I'm used to.\n\nService was good - our water glasses were filled without asking.  The only complaint was that our main courses came out too quickly after our appetizers.  We had to help the waiter move some dishes around while we were still eating and he was juggling the huge platters.\n\nThere's also a back room available for private parties with a more family style seating.\n\nSidenote: You can get a 50% off coupon/entree at the Tix4Less booth downstairs! Or a 10% coupon from their website.\n\n(Check out the pics of our eating in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "2dioqPw6txEgB397frYg-A"}

There is the 'wet' area as water is the main backdrop of the show.  Seat prices for the late show on a Saturday night range from $80/$90/$100.  However, with a one row difference, you can save $10.  And literally, the difference is one row.  \n\nWith the opening act, the show held a great deal of promise.  I was excited and enraptured and couldn't wait to see what else this magnificent stage could showcase.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high.  More often than not, the show fell flat.  With so many senses from sounds, visuals, textures, they could have created more 'acts' at all times, and more often than not, I found myself staring solely at the stage because of the lone performer.  (I continuously looked up, hoping that there would be aerial stunts from above, but there weren't any when I expected them.)\n\nThe costumes and designs were interesting and kept me intrigued, but I felt that the show lacked the draw that would make this a best seller.  \n\nI went to the 10:30 pm showing on a Saturday night in June and there were a lot of empty seats.  That is definitely not encouraging. \n\nSo, with that...I am disappointed.

After getting our beverages, bread and butter were soon to arrive.  It's a soft bread with a sesame crust that leaves a slight bitter taste in your mouth after each bite.  \n\nI didn't want to load up too heavy before the movie, so I chose the Brisket Stuffed Mushrooms ($8.99).  The Salt Lick describes them as  \"Portabellini mushrooms stuffed with our house smoked brisket, cheddar cheese and peppers.  Baked and basted with our world famous Bar-B-Que sauce.\"  They came with four generous mushrooms that can be easily shared with another.  Watch out for the jalapeno pepper that comes along with it, it's a creeper!  Pretty tasty stuff!\n\nThe BF initially wanted the All You Can Eat ($17.99), which includes \"Heaping helpings of slow-smoked brisket of beef, link sausage and pork ribs, served with potato salad, coleslaw, Mama Robert's beans, bread and butter.\"  With less than an hour before our show, he went for the Combination Bar-B-Que Meats ($15.99), \"Slow-smoked brisket, smoked link sausage, and tender, juicy slow-cooked ribs\" instead.  The sausage was damn good, and that's what I call a link!  It came with two ribs which didn't seem to have a whole lot of meet on it.  The BF said it was pretty dry for his tastes.  And the brisket was just okay.  It came with about three slices or so.  The coleslaw was lack luster, and the potato salad was a bit interesting.  It doesn't look like your typical potato salad, you'd expect a savory finish from the looks of it.  And the beans were alright too.\n\n(You can see the pics of our eating in the business profile!)\n\nThe BF expected pickles and onions right off the bat with his order and was disappointed when he had to make a special request for it.  (Definitely ask for it!  It's pickled onions with some tasty pickles, so don't miss out on it!)\n\nService was okay.  After our lunch was delivered, a minute or so went by and the waitress asked, \"You all set?\"  And we said we were and I got the feeling that she wasn't coming around again.  We did have to ask for refills on the BF's soda when she came around with wet napkins.  She did ask if we made room for dessert, which was sad to say no to.  (They had peach or berry cobbler!)\n\nOverall, my lunch was good...not particularly fabulous or anything.  The only sauces available on my table was Heinz ketchup and a Texas hot sauce, so not sure what other sauces I was missing out on.\n\nThey have a few big screen TVs showing the game on, and they automatically add 20% gratuity for parties of 8 or more.\n\nAt first, I was impressed that the busboy took the time to wipe down the chairs when he cleaned up each table, then I realized he was also wiping off whatever was on the table straight onto the floor.

A leisurely dinner that lasted four hours that encompassed the \"Big Night\" menu option.  This included a cheese fondue, a salad choice, the Lobster Indulgence in a cooking style (our choice - Mojo Cooking Style), and a dessert fondue.  We added a bottle of Asti Spumante, Martini & Rossi champagne to complement our meal.\n\nTo start, our waiter melted the cheese fondue (our choice - Traditional Swiss Cheese Fondue) right in front of us.  He presented us with cubes of bread, veggies, and apple slices for dipping.  Next time I would try a different flavored cheese mix, something a bit bolder perhaps.\n\nNext was our salad (our choice - Strawberry Almond Salad), which was a nice mix of sweet with the strawberries and tartness from the balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nThe waiter arrived with our entrees next (Lobster Indulgence - twin lobster tails, teriyaki sirloin, black tiger shrimp, citrus-marinated pork tenderloin, breast of chicken, and roasted vegetable ravioli), a beautiful display with the lobster tails cut perfectly.  After adding different spices to our broth, he went over the finer details of how long we should cook our various foods, from the veggies to the seafood to the meats.  Tons of dipping sauces accompanied the entrees.\n\nTo conclude our meal, the favorite of everyone's...dessert (our choice - Tropical Coconut Rum Chocolate Fondue).  The waiter arrived with our melted chocolate and added the rum and spices.  A plate of bananas, marshmallows, pound cake, strawberries, pineapple and brownies were presented for dipping.  Yummy.\n\nThis was a hearty meal for two, but thoroughly enjoyed.  If you can't do it all, come by for dessert at least.

Celebrating a birthday with about fifteen guests monopolizing a huge rectangular table and barking out numerous requests for more food, drink, etc., I was definitely going to see how they would deal with us.  \n\nIn terms of food, I tried a lobster roll, a Caterpillar roll, a deep-fried coconut chicken skewer in sweet chili sauce, and edamame.  The lobster roll was tasty, and the Caterpillar roll tasted as expected.  The chicken skewer came with four and the toasted coconut added a nice taste to it.  The edamame could have used more rock salt though.\n\nDessert - I went for the creme brulee, which was a big disappointment.  I had to listen to my fellow dining companions oohh and ahh over their much loved Banana's Foster.  I was very jealous.  Another companion raved about her cobbler.  She ate it all herself. Next time, go for the recommended Banana Foster's.  When almost everyone at your table is getting it (and they have been there before), follow suit!    \n\nThe kitchen closes down around 11:30 pm, but the bar remains open.  This is a huge space with tons of tables.  I heard that their happy hour may be worth checking out.  If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind going through the menu a bit more extensively to see what else they got.\n\nLinda, our waitress was great.  Dealing with a bunch of drunk and demanding patrons is never easy and she handled it with ease.  We like that.\n\nUpdate! 02/26/07 - I was there last Friday night and can I tell you, this place is popping!  With their TWO happy hours, this is the place to be during those peak times!  You can drink yourself silly with sake bombs ($1.50 for sake; $4.75 for a large Sapporo or Kirin beer).  You can load up on sushi rolls (Spicy Salmon for $3.00) or their Kobe sliders ($7.00)!  Yeah, this place is huge, so keep your eye out on your waiter because they are super busy.  (They should just hire more staff.)  I had their Yellow Tang, this pineapply type drink that was super sweet and absent of alcohol, while their Mojito was overdone with it!  Either way, I have yet to sit down for a real dinner there but if you're there with friends for drink more so than eat, this is the place! FOUR STARS for their happy hour part!\n\nUpdate! 09/21/07 - I should have read my own review before returning to Sapporo last night!  Taking advantage of their first happy hour again, the BF and I each ordered a mojito.  What a mistake!  They do really bad mojitos here!  I better remember never to order these things from here again.  From their happy hour menu, we ordered the Kobe Sliders ($7), the Crispy Calamari ($6), the Lobster Cocktail Roll ($6), and the Hamachi Roll ($6).  The sliders come in a group of four, and they are pretty tasty.  Four little sandwiches with caramelized onions and a dipping sauce, and the meat cooked (usually) to your liking, what a steal!  The calamari comes with a sweet dipping sauce, and a bed of lettuce leaves that we think are for decoration more so than consumption.  The lobster roll is pretty grub, mixed with a creamy (aka mayonnaise) sauce and avocado, I like it!  The hamachi roll is pretty standard with green onions mixed into it. \n\nI realize that in all my visits to Sapporo, I have yet to go during non-happy hour times!

Just as well, it saved us a $50 cover charge and now we were going to eat.  Not wanting to go far, we stumbled over to the Carnegie Delicatessen with our large party.\n\nAs we waited in line, everyone went through the dramatics of the night.  It was our turn when the host started to close off the line.  I was confused for a moment, thinking he wasn't going to let us in.  He proceeded to motion for us to follow and he had a table waiting for us already!  Sweet...except that he had only counted ten as two other people had joined us in the line late.  It's okay, we were able to have our additional party of two nearby.\n\nYummy pickles were placed in front of us and I wish I had more.  The menu was huge and I didn't even know where to look.  The BF wanted \"The Woody Allen\", a gigantic sandwich with loads of pastrami and corned beef ($15.95).  The waitress warned us that it was a big sandwich, as high as our water glass.  We were fine with it as we were sharing.  Indeed, it was a big one, as you can see for yourself from the photo above.

You definitely need to smear that mustard all up on your meat to give it a zing.  I didn't really care for the bread though.  The BF finished his half and my leftovers went home.

Without reservations and only part of our party ordering dinner, we were allowed to sit anywhere in the bar area.  This worked out well with a few large tables that sit about six that were available for everyone.\n\nThe BF was starving and the Prix Fixe special (5 pm to 6 pm) was looking rather appetizing.  They offered two appetizers to choose from, and he went for the Hot Rocks ($17), which is advertised as \"Thinly Sliced Sirloin, Tableside Preparation.\"  The waiter comes by with a plate of hot rocks, and then another plate of about six slices of marinated sirloin.  You're then supposed to place the meat on the hot rock for a few moments to cook it.  The meat tasted so good that we barely seared it as the meat was pretty flavorful on the rear end!\n\nOf the two entrees, he chose the 9 oz. Petite Filet Bone-Out ($40), medium rare.  It looked rather small when it arrived, which a single potato chip on top of it.  But we realized with its thickness, that it was actually a hearty piece.  It came with two sauces, both which were very tasty.\n\nOf the two dessert choices, he went for the highly recommended Jelly Doughnut \"Munchkin\" Holes...mmmmmm jelly ($8).  It came with about four doughnut holes filled with red jelly and a vanilla bean dipping sauce.  The BF would have loved it if the vanilla bean sauce was already inside the doughnut holes!\n\nOur friend and I decided to try drinks from their Cocktail Menu.  She went for the Impeared ($12), \"Grey Goose Poire, Fresh Pear Nectar, Muddled Pear & Sage.\"  It was complimented with an Asian pear slice and was really tasty.  (She actually ordered it again, but the second one was stronger and not as sweet.)  I ordered the Bellini ($12), \"Absolut Peach, Fresh White Peach Puree & Sparkling Wine.\"  Really good stuff!  It made me want to buy some of this stuff and make it at home all the time.  What a treat!  \n\nWe shared the Mixed Greens Salad ($12), \"Teardrop Tomatoes, Avocado, Shallot Vinaigrette.\"  When I told the waitress we were going to share it, I was surprised to see two plates of salad to arrive.  The waitress confirmed that it was indeed one order split in two.  What  a generous portion of salad!  We were all surprised and it was quite good too!  The salad was dressed perfectly, not too little and not too much. And the avocado, tomatoes, and cucumbers all complimented it so perfectly.  (If we had each ordered our own salad, I think we wouldn't have made it to dessert then!)\n\nFor dessert, we also ordered the Mini Key Lime Pies ($8) with \"Margarita\" Sorbet.  However, our friend only saw the \"sorbet\" part and didn't even realize she ordered the pies!  It came with three miniature pies with a meringue topping that was pretty good.  The yummy sorbet sat on sweet pineapple bits that complimented the dessert perfectly!  The sweet crispy thing on top tasted great as well! \n\nOverall, we were pretty impressed with the food.  I have eaten at FIX over at The Bellagio, and recalled there were some memorable bites from their menu too.\n\nService was pretty good. The waitresses were attentive and 'stacked.'  I think they were training a new waitress, so there was an extra set of hands available.  I would definitely return to STACK again, whether it's to enjoy a couple of their cocktails, grab a quick bite, or split a dessert.\n\nSidenote: There's a yellow lighting issue at this restaurant, which makes everything you order look yellow.  After taking pictures of the food with a flash, then you can really see how great everything looks!

They get major points for constantly having carts of food roll by.  The only problem was that the selection was to the minimum.  I would get all excited every time I see a cart, only to discover each lady had the same exact thing as the lady before her.  Bummer.  \n\nI give them major points for having Shanghai dumplings.  However, they were horrendous!  The skin was unusually thick and you'll never find me ordering that here again.  They also had the very special Shark Fin Dumpling Soup (Goon Tong Gow,  to fill with liquid, soup, dumpling) that you have to special order.  It comes with red vinegar and ginger slices for you to dump into the soup.  Yes, major props for having it, but it didn't taste that great either.  And instead of shark fin, they had glass noodles instead!\n\nTheir standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings were decent.  Their chicken feet in black bean sauce was flavorful.  Their bean curd wrapped seafood thing was okay, some of it over steamed though.  The Chinese broccoli was slippery as heck and the shrimp rice noodle was decent too.\n\nThe tricky thing was that as we hung out after we paid our bill, we noticed different stuff coming out!  I saw the Pineapple Bun and inquired if there was yellow egg custard in it, and the lady confirmed there was!  Since discovering this yummy bun only recently, I had to get some.  And it was oh so good, and piping hot too!  (It's the marriage of the Bolo Bao and the Nai Wong Bao!)  \n\nI only had the small egg custard tarts and this other fruit tart that I wouldn't usually see in a dim sum restaurant for dessert.  They did have the soft tofu, but the lady scooping it caught too much water in there, drowning out the syrupy taste.\n\nOverall, Orchids Garden was a decent place for dim sum on a Saturday morning.  It's a huge place with lots of Chinese (ethnic Chinese, as I could hear Cantonese being spoken everywhere) and non-Chinese customers dining here.  I like that you can see non-Chinese families dining here as it can often be intimidating at these huge dim sum operations.  \n\nAnd the prices were pretty decent too. With a party of four, it came out to about $65 total, and we definitely stuffed ourselves pretty good too.\n\nUntil I find another place better, you'll find me here again.  The wait was minimal too. And there's parking in the back as well!\n\nUpdate: 01/03/07 - I've been back twice already since this review!  And it's not because the food is so fabulous, but I have yet to find a better one.  You can easily fit 14 people at a table with minimal wait too!  And their Pineapple Egg Custard buns are so worthy waiting for!  Get them while they are hot and take them all if you can!  They are THAT good.\n\nUpdate: 11/05/07 - Went back yesterday for dim sum.  Their chicken's feet was pretty good, and the deep fried calamari was a surprise hit too.  The BF really like the roasted pork that came with pickled veggies.  Their chive and shrimp dumpling is good when it's hot, and thank goodness the Shanghai dumplings never came out since I forgot our bad experience with it the first time!  The pineapple egg custard bun was present, but not quite as good when it's not piping hot.  So, only get it when it's hot hot hot!", "type": "review", "business_id": "23SJEjfyU5gxY2chAKhgcw"}

And I don't mean just one trampoline here, there are over twenty trampolines - all connected together! So you literally get to jump from one trampoline to another.  And they also have trampolines on the side walls too!  This is your chance to try all those aerial stunts you wanted to try as a kid.  You can jump onto the wall, do a flip and just keep on jumping!  They even offer 3-D Dodgeball and hoops for you to try to fly through.\r\n\r\nI found myself here on a Sunday night after my friend suggested this idea months before.  Sure, I've done my share of trampoline jumping in someone's backyard.  But this setup, you just can't find in someone's yard.  So, there I was practicing my front and back somersaults.  And sure, I ate it a few times...everyone needs a few good face plants every now and then.  But the idea of just jumping your ass off and getting your heart rate up reminds me of jumping on my bed until it felt like my heart was going to explode.  \r\n\r\nFor Open Court Jumping, you can pay by the hour on the hour or half for $8.50/hr.  (At our age, we figure an hour was plenty and it was!  It's gets super tiring jumping!)  On the hour and the half, they blow their whistle reminding those who have finished their session that they time is up.  This is when they make everyone take a mini break on the sides until everyone who is supposed to be off is gone.  And then you can resume to your jumping pleasures!   \r\n\r\nYeah, sure...I did ask my friend if we were the oldest ones there and we were.  But so what?!  We had a fabulous time nonetheless and agreed that it would have made a fantastic date spot!  See if you can drag a bunch of your friends along with you.  I'm sure it'll make it that much more fun! \r\n\r\nSide note: With no lockers, I suggest you leave mostly everything in your car or at home (hotel).  You can leave your keys/wallet at the front, but it gets jumbled up with everyone else's keys/wallets.  Bring water, Gatorade, etc. because you will need it!  And most likely you'll feel the need to shower right afterwards.  This is a serious workout!  Let me know if you try it out!", "type": "review", "business_id": "euyLDi74sLAYC9z9Pw-2oQ"}

My taste buds were shot and everything tasted bland.\n\nThis time around, healthy and taste buds in full working order, I went ahead and ordered my favorite, the Pork Lau Lau.  I also asked for two scoops of mac salad instead of two scoops of rice.  (Most Hawaiian restaurants will substitute without charging, so I usually prefer to do that.)\n\nThe pork lau lau was definitely a lot better than the one I had at Aloha Specialties Restaurant in the California Hotel!  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg?hrid=XPspyfknURLxczv4O2ZUvg)  It wasn't dry and old like the other place and had a lot more flavor.  I did add a lot of soy sauce to my dish, which I tend to do all the time.  I could have used a bit more fat in mine too, but that's more of a personal preference.\n\nWhen I was done cleaning off my plate of two scoops of mac salad, one scoop of rice, and the pork lau lau dish,  my boyfriend looked at me and asked if that was a mini order or a full plate.  \"Uh, a full one...they didn't offer the mini for the pork lau lau...\"  I guess it was his way of calling me a piggie!

But the big disappointment was the actual cake itself.  There wasn't much flavor or taste in the cake.  Perhaps because of the heavy sweetness of the frosting, the cake was made to taste a bit bland.  \n\nMy friend got the Banana Split, their Flavor of the Month.  This was an interesting cake with banana cream in the middle of the cake.  This added some nice flavor to the cake and made it very indulgent.  He also raved about their other flavors, and I'm going to give them the four star because of the great potential of this place.  \n\nTheir interesting choice of names of each of these cupcakes is a nice touch too.  At $2.25/each or $24/dozen, they can get costly.  But when you walk into The Cupcake, the staff is friendly and the layout of the desserts available makes your mouth water.  You can't help but love a place that gets you excited the moment you walk into the door.\n\nUpdate: 11/13/06 - I tried their latest seasonal addition.  The sweet potato one.

When in Vegas, it's the latter...at least in this case.\n\nSeeing billboards all over town advertising their dim sum, I must admit, I was very hesitant.  I would even say I wanted not to like it.  But I did, believe or not.  Ping Pang Pong located in the Gold Coast Casino has some of the better dim sum I've tried in Vegas, and I've been to a few.\n\nIt's a smaller restaurant than the only ones I've tried (listed below) and you can watch the casino floor as you dine.\n\nSaturday morning and we were seated rather quickly.  Quite a few Chinese people eating dim sum here as well, which is always a good sign.  They give you a menu with prices which is a bit unique for dim sum, but definitely helpful.  (Price ranges split into four categories for the most part - A plates are $2.18; B plates are $2.88; C plates are $3.88; and D plates are $5.88. ) Immediately after you're seated, the dim sum carts come your way.  If you can' t find what you're looking for, but it's on the menu, wave a server down and they'll order it for you.  \n\nPing Pang Pong has a surprisingly large selection of dim sum choices and it's pretty good.  Regular steamed dim sum range in the A and B categories.  They even had the elusive Shark Fin Dumpling ($5.88), but no Shanghai dumpling.  They also give you the bottle of red vinegar as opposed to the dinky little soy sauce dish amount.  The Shark Fin Dumpling had a nice mushroom broth too that was quite tasty and stood out.  They didn't have the Pineapple Custard bun that I love so much, but they had the plain Pineapple Bun ($2.18).  The BF especially loved their Macanese Egg Tarts ($3.88).  He hasn't had them since being in Macau and even had an order to go. \n\nThey have a decent amount of 'cool sweets' in the B plates - Red Bean Pudding Cake, Chilled Mango and Pink Grapefruit Cocktail, Tapioca and Purple Rice Pudding, Lychee Pudding, etc.  'Warm' and 'hot sweets' range from A through C categories and include Baked Tapioca Green Tea Pudding, Steamed Egg White and Sweet Cream, Seared Water Chestnut Pudding Cake, Thousand Layer Cake, etc. \n\nService was okay.  We did have to wave the servers down as only certain people can assist you with special orders while others only clear tables and push the carts.  \n\nPrices weren't too expensive either and I would say it's moderately priced for a casino.  The only downfall would be if you came with a very large party.  It might take awhile to get seated if they are extremely busy.  \n\nNonetheless, looks like Ping Pang Pong might be where I'm headed when I want some dim sum in the desert.\n\nRankings for dim sum in Vegas thus far:\n1) Ping Pang Pong\n2) Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine\n3) Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant\n4) Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant\n5) Cathay House Restaurant\n\nSidenote: When you ask for hot sauce, be sure to specify hot chili oil.  It'll be the good stuff instead of the red sauce with chili flakes.  Well, it's the good stuff I prefer with my dim sum.  And of course, hot yellow mustard too.\n\nUpdated! 06/10/07 - We returned again yesterday for dim sum and imagine my surprise when I saw pickled pig's feet being served!  This delicacy is usually only served after a woman gives birth.  A bunch of the older women relatives would come over and take over your kitchen while stewing up this stuff for you.  Once in awhile, I would wake up to this wonderful aroma when my mom felt the desire to make it.  I used to joke that I would have kids just to have people make this for me!  Now I can enjoy this vinegary fatty goodness anytime at Ping Pang Pong!  Yay!  For our party of five, it was about $100 with tip and tax.\n\nUpdated! 03/02/08 - Went to dim sum on Sunday...arrived around 2:35 pm and was reminded they closed at 3 pm.  We were fine with that and were quick to load our table with all the dim sum dishes we wanted.  The staff horded around our table asking if we wanted to make any final orders since the kitchen was closing up, and we said we were good.  With that, the check was presented to our table.  We continued eating and it wasn't long before the server reached across for the bill.  (I told her it wasn't taken care of yet.)  She pulled back in surprise and walked away.  She then returned to tell me they were closing out the register, so could we pay?  \n\nI have been to other dim sum restaurants where you are 'allowed' to eat, despite the kitchen part closing.  It was pretty discouraging that they were so overanxious to get our money and to get rid of us.  The dim sum lady obviously hated her job 'cuz she was banging the little dishes around.   \n\nNote to self: Don't bother going to PPP after 2:00 for dim sum, service is crap.  Food is okay though...but going downhill.  Seek other dim sum restaurants SOON!  I brought their star rating down from a four to a three!", "type": "review", "business_id": "tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g"}

Sure, I really thought they were the best dim sum experience in Vegas (compared to the other few we have), but they have been going downhill since that very first visit (and review).  \n\nFirst off, there aren't that many dishes offered anymore!  They used to have a larger variety and now they are lacking!  They don't even offer the Big F's favorite - the Macanese egg tart, which really puts a damper on things.  (They apparently are trying out this new egg souffle dish instead.)  I haven't seen the pickled pig's feet ever again as well.  Blah!\n\nService was pretty horrible too.  I thought it was because I get dumped at the corner table all the time, but I just think it sucks.  The last time we ate there (last month), we didn't even have all our dishes and serving utensils before the dim sum arrived.  It took awhile to wave down a waiter and get some tea.  We ordered a plate of Singapore noodles and that took forever to come out as well.  \n\nAnd it's so random when it's busy.  On one Saturday I went, there was no wait.  And then other times it's a good half an hour wait for a party of four.  You just never know.\n\nHowever, I have since requested that we go back and try the other dim sum places in Vegas again since PPP leaves me less than happy and not satisfied.  (The Big F claims that when he went without me, they had tons of stuff coming out!  Maybe I'm bad luck or something!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g"}

Finally had a chance to check it out when a friend starting working there last weekend.\n\nArriving after two am and skipping past the small line, we walk right into the packed dance floor/bar area.  It's like a sardine can up in this joint.  You can barely dance or move, and I didn't even notice we were standing right in front of a sunken bar because of how packed it was.  \n\nWe eventually move to the other bar that's up a few steps and right when you walk in.  Plenty of room over here with accessibility to that bar and space to shake your booty.  We even got to see two burlesque dancers give a little show and hang from the lighting bars.  (My only complaint - these girls need a bigger stage than what you're giving them!)  Things got even better when we were able to hang out in a VIP area with chairs and a roped off section.  This part is always cool 'cuz now you really have room for your own party and you can see all the action from where you're at.  \n\nIt's a mixed crowd at Forty Deuce's.  I noticed at least three bachelorette parties, so I guess that's a good sign for more guys to come.  We even met this guy who offered us drinks from his VIP section and asked if we wanted to sit with them too. (Our party declined 'cuz after all, we had guys in our group and they probably wouldn't have liked that all that much.)\n\nMusic wise - the deejay is playing music from all genres, eras, etc.  And he changes his music quick! It's like a chorus or two from each song and then he's onto another one.  This is good and bad - if you hear a song you don't like, they'll change it soon enough.  But when it's a good song, they don't play it long enough for your liking.  For the most part, they were playing decent music that I could dance to.  At one point when we were supposed to be leaving, I noticed the BF was no longer behind me.  What happened?!  I went back into the club and he hollered, \"We have to dance!  It's a good song!\"  \n\nOverall, Ivan Kane's Forty Deuce is a much smaller club than your other Vegas partying scenes.  It's a pretty small room and gets crowded.  Not sure what the cover is here, so I don't think I would want to drop a twenty to be here.\n\nSidenote: We even got a free drink pass too.

Suggestions are for Famous Dave's BBQ and off we go.  \n\nIt wasn't busy for this Easter Sunday, surprisingly.  It took about ten to fifteen minutes for our table to be ready for our party of nine.  \n\nTonya, our waitress started us off with drinks.  The majority of our party started with Southern Sweet Tea.  It was yummy, but not quite as good as the stuff I had in Georgia or at Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ.\n\nI was torn between the Sweetwater Catfish Fingers and the Texas Beef Brisket, so I ended up with both, the Two-Meat Combo! It automatically comes with corn-on-the cob, corn bread muffin, and a choice of two sides.  Although the breaded catfish was a bit tasty, I was a bit disappointed in the size of the fingers.  Indeed, they are definitely 'fingers' and are small strips of fish.  They come with two sauces - a Sweet Soul Jalapeno and remoulade.  I found the remoulade to be more enjoyable than the other sauce.    The brisket was less than what I expected and a bit dry.  I wouldn't order it again.  My two sides were Drunkin' Apples and Garlic Red-Skin Mashed Potatoes.  The apples were nothing special with cinnamon sprinkled on it, but the mashed potatoes were good.\n\nThe BF opted for the Rib-N-Meat Combo, which included bone spareribs and a choice of a hot link, wings, catfish, or any of the other meats offered.  He went for the hot link.  He got a hearty portion of spareribs and they were definitely a lot tastier than my dish.  The hot link was okay though.\n\nThey have about seven different sauces to choose from at your table - Devil's Spit, Georgia Mustard,  Hot & Sassy, Smokey Chipotle, Rich & Sassy,  Sweet & Zesty, and Texas Pit.\n\nThey don't offer that many sides to choose from - Potato Salad, Creamy Coleslaw,  Wilbur Beans, Famous Fries, and Firecracker Green Beans (w/bacon) are the only other choices.\n\nIf you do end up with leftovers, be sure to ask for a few containers to take home the sauces with.  They have a few sauces packaged to go, otherwise you can squeeze some into those plastic containers.\n\nService was good.  Tonya was pretty good with bringing lots of refills of our Sweet Tea because she knew we were thirsty things.  It saved us the trouble of having to ask her for more and she was one step ahead of the game.\n\nOverall, Famous Dave's was just okay in my book.  My brisket and catfish were disappointing, but the spareribs were more enjoyable.  They do have my Sweet Tea, but it wasn't sweet enough.  My order was less than stellar, it was alright.  It's a chain restaurant located in almost every state except 11 of them!  They must be doing alright then!", "type": "review", "business_id": "en2O4AiS0NDZ1AHgzYKzBA"}

They were offering 50% off the buffet with your movie stub, and we had just returned from watching Transformers.  It's seafood night, so the price was about $16.95/pp, but what a steal when you get half off.  The BF was craving some snow crab legs and I noted oysters on the half shell.  We both gorged on those two alone, and maybe with some shrimp, and when we did finally check out what else they offered, it was sad to see that there really wasn't much else.  They were out of spoons, bowls, etc., and it didn't matter where you checked on the buffet line, they just didn't have any!  Even the soft serve machine was breaking down when I was there.  Overall, there's not much going on in this buffet.  Yes, there's a line to be seated, but I think it's because everyone had a coupon of some sort too.

Fort Apache actually deemed pretty decent said my fellow diners as they are frequent eaters of the other Roberto's around Sin City.  \n\nI ordered the Rolled Tacos (2 chicken and 1 beef) with Guacamole.  They were okay.  I think the frozen ones I had at home were a bit better.  The guacamole was plentiful, but a little too sweet for what I had in mind.  It would have been superb it my cheese was melted a bit...maybe add the cheese first and then pour on the guacamole?  The insides of my rolled tacos weren't hot enough for my tastes either.  Overall, they just weren't crispy enough for something that just came out of the deep fryer.  \n\nI did get to try the Al Pastor soft tacos and those were definitely much yummier than my order!  The meat was super flavorful and definitely hitting my taste buds.  They taste even better when you load them up with freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce, and jalapeno peppers.  Unfortunately, my dining companion was a bit of a piggy and didn't bother saving any leftovers for me the next day!  Keep in mind that al pastor isn't offered at all the Roberto's, so take advantage of it when you find it on the menu.    \n\nAnother friend ordered what looked like the Carne Asada Fries and that was one hell of a mutha focker order!  When you open up your styrofoam box, it's like damn...that's your dinner?  Major bang for your buck for sure!  (It was noted that my friend said he got more here than at the other Roberto's!)\n\nI finished up my meal with a $2 large Horchata that was oh so yummy!  And for two bucks, what a deal!  Hot damn!

The BF has been there before, but this was my first time.  We were the only customers on this weekday evening.\n\nFor an appetizer, we shared #1 Goi cuon (spring rolls: rice sheet shrimp, pork & lettuce) for $3.50.  In the picture, it shows four spring rolls which I thought was a hearty amount.  (I was originally going to just order that for dinner.)  When it arrived, it was actually one spring roll cut in half with hoisin dipping sauce.  I thought this was definitely false advertising.  (What if we had a party of four and planned on sharing?)\n\nFor my main, I went for #9 Bun bo xao xa (Grilled lemongrass sliced beef over vermicelli and vegetables) for $7.25.  When it arrived, it looked like a hearty portion.  Then I moved the beef around noticed it really wasn't all that much.  It tasted more like a stir-fry than grilled beef.  However, the onions were cooked to perfection.\n\nThe BF wanted grilled sliced pork, but over rice.  The waitress suggested #8 Bun thit nuong, cha gio (Grilled sliced pork and fried egg rolls over vermicelli and vegetables) for $7.95, but replace the noodles with rice.  When his order arrived, it really didn't look like much.  It came with two fried egg roll halves and the grilled pork definitely didn't look like anything in the picture.  If anything, it looked like the leftover scrap meat you have when you're done grilling.  There was more rice on the plate than anything.  \n\nOverall, we paid over $20 for our dinner, and that was not including beverages.  We left hungry.  It wasn't worth the price for what we got overall.

And it's not just from the locals that are talking about it...it's from the native Hawaiians who are visiting or have relocated and all the other tourists talking about this infamous oxtail soup.  \n\nServed only after 11 pm until about 9 am or 11 am, you'll wait in line for a hour just to get a taste of it.  At $5.95 a bowl, you get two scoops of white rice, a few hearty chunks of oxtail and a light broth with carrots, peanuts and other good bits.  My favorite part - the ginger and cilantro mix they give you so you can toss all that shit right into your soup.  Yum!  And it's not a heavy dish...it's light and doesn't make you feel sick like typical late night fare does.  So, why only three stars then?\n\nWell, because it's only served after 11 pm and I'm damn tired when I get there.  And the line is always so long!  (I waited an hour last night for this stuff!)  They need to hire more wait staff so they could open up all the tables in this restaurant and get us all seated faster.  Everyone is in line just for the soup and nothing else.  Just take a look around you and that's all you'll see.  They won't allow you to take this order to go, which is just as well because people like me would call in an order of twenty soups and they would never be able to put up with the supply and demand of that!  This hotel is located in the downtown area, away from all the glitz and glamor of new Vegas.  So, if you don't have a car, you're less likely to make your way down there.  After a heavy night of partying, you can only hope there's at least one sober and awake driver willing to take you to the California Hotel and stand in line with you for this soup.  And also, if I'm sick in bed or just want to be a brat, I can't beg or plead for my boyfriend to bring this soup home to me because he can't!  Damn!  \n\nThe sad part about my first experience with this soup was that the broth was lukewarm.  This was disappointing.  When my sister and her husband ordered a second bowl, it came out piping hot, and what a difference!  I should have asked them to nuke mine a bit so I could have had that hot piping experience for sure!  Next time - I want it hot hot hot and another side helping of freshly grated ginger and cilantro please!\n\nUpdate! 03/29/08 - Went back last night after a long hiatus and I think I'm done with their oxtail soup.  (I can make it better at home!)  The price went up!  So now it's $7.95!  The line was short when we got there on a Friday night way after 1 am.  Sure, there's TONS of people ordering up this stuff, but I spent the whole time digging my teeth into the oxtail trying to pull the meat off.  Patrons were watching as the oxtail slipped from my fingers and fell into my bowl of soup.  By the time we left, I was in some major need of floss!  (Maybe I've been spoiled 'cuz when I make it at home, the meat gingerly falls off.  No gnawing necessary!)\n\nUpdate! 04/27/08 - Only went b/c my parents were craving the oxtail!  I had the Banana Fritters ($3.25), it came with four pieces of banana wrapped in wonton skins and deep fried, additional banana chunks, a side of caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with whipped cream on top.  The skin was way too thick on the deep-fried bananas.  The only saving grace was the caramel sauce and ice cream. \n\nMy dad had their $4.00 Half a Pound New York Steak, it came with vegetable, rice, fries, or mashed potatoes.  Not a bad deal for four dollars, huh?\n\nService - I never mentioned it before, but for the most part, the service is good.

Hell yeah!

It didn't help that we could see (stare) at what the diners were chowing on as they sat on the patio.  Gigantic portions of anything and everything, that's for sure!\n\nI had their special Mimosa with Pom Tangerine.  Can I say yum?  If my boyfriend will make me a pitcher of that, I promise to get drunk real fast!  My other dining companions had their HH Bloody Mary with all the fixings.  Those darn fixings were fabuloso!  They came with these vinegared Blue Lake string beans and stuffed green olives.  I heard two exclamations of \"I think this the BEST Bloody Mary I have ever had!\"  Hot damn!  That was 2 for 2!\n\nFor food, I ordered their special Farmer's Daughter House Hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on potatoes.  It was damn good!  My BF had the HH Famous Meatloaf Hash House with spinach, meatloaf chunks, cheese and some other stuff on potatoes, along with two eggs his way, watermelon and a biscuit.  These house hashes arrived on a big ole' skillet and were hearty portions, which could easily be shared by two.  \n\nMy other dining companion had a omelet with salmon and brie.  The brie was such a nice and smooth taste to the omelet. Yummy!  And our 4th diner chose Two Eggs with Bacon and Toast.  Both orders arrived with a gigantic mound of mashed potatoes that were tasty too.  \n\nThe best part...thank goodness the waitress told us about the homemade strawberry jam!  We were slathering that all over our biscuits and were just about to slather it all over ourselves. It was that good!  Hot damn!\n\nLooking around at other diners, they had massive salads, gigantic pancakes and waffles that were falling over the edge of the plate, and huge sandwiches.  It all looked so good!  Portions were plenty and you definitely feel like you get a big bang for your buck!  \n\nI was definitely curious to see if the dessert menu was so generous.  Unfortunately, we were told the desserts were of average size.  They only had a Strawberry Cobbler, Cheesecake, and some Snickers thing.  But then again, with all this food...who makes it to dessert anyway?    \n\nService was fabulous!  Our waitress was super friendly, being patient with our delay in ordering and even bringing over more Bloody Mary fixings so we could devour.  \n\nWith a name like this, I am confident that you can have a feast after a little 'hash' of your own!  I'm even putting this restaurant into my \"Top Restaurants\" and \"Nice date restaurants in Vegas\" because if a boy brought me here 'the morning after', he would get a gold star in my book for sure!  That's right boys...if you're letting the girl stay over into brunch time and you bring her here, she'll be more than happy to go back to your place again (assuming you give her a chance to digest!).  And ladies, if you bring the guy here the morning after, he'll be sure to stick around for a few more mornings after for sure!  \n\nAnyone who wants a hearty brunch in Vegas away from the strip, Hash House a Go Go is your place to go!  Their numerous awards for breakfast and brunch are well deserved!\n\nUpdate: 01/04/07 - I recently went back for their special Blue Lump Crab Cake with chili mayo and mashed potatoes ($15.95).  The mayo had a nice zing for the crab cake and the deep fried angel hair pasta garnishment had a nice crunch.  It was a yummy dish and big enough to share.  It's a $2.50 split charge if you do share it.  Their homemade jam was a mixed berry concoction this time.  I also tried their Banana Pancake with Cinnamon.

I ate it all up, sadly enough, minus the biscuit.  And yes, I am still full from my breakfast.  It's a hearty portion alright!

All of their benedicts are \"served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes.\"  It was a huge pile of something with creamy sauce dripping all over it.  I took a bite, and in retrospect, I don't think I tasted anything beyond the fried chicken and cream sauce!  I did see the generous scrambled egg resting on top of the chicken though!  The Husband did box up the other half since it is such a generous order though.  \n\n* Andy's famous Bread pudding topped w/ ice cream and served w/ a cup of coffee ($7.95) - The waitress said the only bread pudding they offered was the Snickers one.  I don't recall a Snickers bread pudding on the menu, and this one didn't taste like there was any Snickers in it.  No cup of coffee arrived with it either.  It was good though.\n\nService was okay, water glasses were refilled in a timely manner. We thought she forgot about our dessert since it was taking longer than usual.

The shrimp was covered with a red sauce that I wasn't too sure of, and would have preferred it plain so I can cover it up with the typical Louie dressing that was provided.  They gave us some yummy cheesy flat bread that was flaky and full of flavor and a couple of hard rolls with cold butter.  (I hate trying to spread hard butter on a hard roll. Blah.)  Despite their crap oyster selection, we still went for it.  At $11 for half a dozen, we went for the full dozen at $16.  They only had the NY Primes that day.  They were accompanied with cocktail sauce and horseradish and a couple of wedges of lemon.  (Note: With a dozen oysters, two wedges of lemons just don't cut it!)

Some initial heat would have been nice to start with in this dish.  They also offered fresh clams on the half shell too, but I'm more of an oyster fan myself.  We definitely didn't have any room for dessert though.\n\nOverall, service was good.  Clean and bright and very spacious.  I wouldn't mind going back if they could expand their oyster selection a bit more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nQeAnwwJmfoyH8k4kSfqaQ"}

We usually stick to the beef dishes and noodles, but that's about it. So, imagine my surprise when I was offered the raw crab.  For sure! \n\nJin Mee is among a slew of other Korean restaurants nearby a Korean supermarket, so it's hard to choose which one to go to.  (In this case, if there are other Koreans eating there, that's a good sign.)  With lots of seating area, we ended up a table at the far end after a bout of musical chairs.  We initially wanted to cook our own beef but discovered that they only let you do that if there is more than one order.  We also ordered this rice dish in a clay pot and the raw crab dish.  \n\nThe Kalbi beef was tasty and I always prefer this with white rice so I can enjoy the intense flavors of the beef on its own.  The clay pot rice dish was a bit mix of stuff.  The crispy edges are what you're really aiming for and you have to be sure to crisp them up quick.  The raw crab smothered in Korean chili paste was a first timer for me.  The shell was soft in certain sections where you can drag your teeth along to pull the tasty morsels out.  Other times, I think I would have asked for a cracker to bust into the claws for all the other juicy bits.  Full of flavor and spice, it's one messy dish!  (Ask for extra napkins when you get this!)  There was a lot of food for the two of us, and we couldn't finish the crab at all.  \n\nSide dishes - I was looking for the anchovies, which they didn't have, and same for the spinach.  They rotate the side dishes out, so I guess it's a hit or miss depending on what day you go.  (It was a Saturday night for me.)  In my experience, it's always best to go with a Korean person if you can.  You discover additional side dishes that aren't usually offered to everyone else.  And your Korean friend will know what other ones to ask for too if they don't see it.\n\nBathrooms - they must have remodeled.  Walking into the back, you feel like things are  a bit under construction.  Then you find the bathrooms and are pleasantly surprised with how new it is.  So new that there's no place to hang the toilet paper yet!  (As my friend said, he almost felt the urge to christen the new bathrooms!)  \n\nService - the girls are nice and service is decent.  I did have to ask for more tea as they weren't checking to see if we needed any.  \n\nOverall, it's a decent place.  The crab was a great discovery for me, but I've had a better selection of sides to entice me more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DTtIi7avC0Ed-tMZAAx4wA"}

But when they find out you're here for dining in, they'll have you take a seat for a full service experience.\n\nWe wanted a taste of it all, so the BF and I ordered up one of their \"Lots O' Meat Meal Deals\" for any combination of three meats, cornbread and two sides for $14.99.  Of the meats, we chose the Beef Tips, Links (2), and 1/4 Baby Back Rib Slab.  You can also choose Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Beef Ribs, Spare Ribs, or 1/4 Chicken.  Or sides, we chose the Grandma Georgia's Macaroni and Cheese and the Fried Okra.  Other sides include Aunt Ada's Potato Salad, Big Sam's Baked Beans, Cousin Joe's Greens, Uncle Earl's Coleslaw, Sweet Potato French Fries, Fried Jalapenos, and few other staples.\n\nThis meal was plenty for the two of us!  The Beef Tips were more like chunks of meat, not as tender as I would have hoped.  The Links were pretty grub though, a  nice crunch and texture and pretty tasty.  The Baby Back Ribs were okay.  The first rib I got has little meat on it, the second rib had more though.  We got a generous portion of fried okra, more than what they give you at M & M Soul Food Cafe.  It's breaded up and could use a bit more zing though.  The Macaroni and Cheese is a bit different with a grainy texture.  It's tasty, but  I guess it all depends if you like your mac and cheese creamy or not.  \n\nThey also serve up some Sweet Tea for $1.49 or $2.49.  Don't be a fool and get the small cup, go for the super large one instead!  Yum yum!  \n\nThey have a bucket load of desserts to choose from the Friday early evening we showed up!  Banana pudding, Coconut Cake, Snickers Cake, Homemade Louisiana Pralines, Glazed Donut Bread Pudding, etc.  It's definitely worth taking a look at their dessert display!\n\nWe also ordered a Full Slab of Baby Back Ribs with 2 Sides and Cornbread for $18.99 to go.\n\nThey have a Kids' Menu for $3.49 for those ten and under.  Kids eat free on Mondays with the purchase of an adult meal too!  They also serve up Burgers and Sammies, Chicken, and Catfish (on Fridays only)!\n\nFood is a solid three star, but the service is a four.  The wait didn't take 20 minutes like it was posted it can, so that's a good thing.  They come by and check up on you, get refill on your drinks if that's what you got, etc.  You can tell they have a lot of return customers here.  My big concern is seeing a bunch of older people with obvious health problems chowing down on not so health conscious food choices!\n\n(Of course you can find our hearty meal pics in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "EppRsj7YUChmu9rXb38LKg"}

(It's been reported that the Tao Restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in Vegas!)  Just as we were about to enter the hallway, this VERY large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  Talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nWe were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the huge Buddha.  As menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  As I perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, I didn't even know where to begin.  My fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. Grilled Kobe Sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nThe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  I could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (I would not consider Tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nIn the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  And this is what we got:\n\nSquab Lettuce Wraps ($14) - This came with five lettuce leaves.  A decent amount to fill all the leaves.  The squab mixture was a bit too moist and the BF found it too sweet.  I had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  There was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\nLobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($16) - A clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  Very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  A very light and delicate dish.  \n\nSashimi of Kobe Beef with Fresh Wasabi Sauce ($28) - Beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  We couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  Lovely taste and clean.  However, I didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\nPork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce ($11) - This order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  The spring roll was decent, nothing particular special about it.  The Thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nMiso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - Very good, but I guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece of Chilean sea bass?\n\nRoasted Thai Buddha Chicken ($26) - We must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  It did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces of chicken in it, including the drumstick.  It was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\nJasmine White Rice ($4) - Of course we had to order some rice!  We got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\nOverall, the food was good.  Definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a certain kind of clientele.  You'll be amused to find things like Kung Pao Chicken ($26) and Grilled Prime Porterhouse with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($88) on the same menu.  We decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended Giant Fortune Cookie ($10) or Fuji Apple Springroll ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (We actually drove over to Luv-It Frozen Custard instead!)\n\nService is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and Tao fails in this department.  I was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the BF to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (Uh, who does that?!)  As they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  I felt like I was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  I'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  The waitstaff should take a few lessons from Rosemary's Restaurant's waitstaff.  That's what I call service!\n\nAt the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  And it was...just okay.  They asked if we were going to the club afterward and I said yes and asked if they had any passes.  What they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  However, you will still have to pay cover.  (I think this part is rather ridiculous.  They should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  With the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  Not the best pass I would say.\n  \nTao Restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.

These little buns are dressed with this yummy garlic and oil concoction.  Although the bread itself doesn't taste very garlicky to be called a garlic twist, the garlic sauce stuff is worthy to bathe in.  I couldn't get enough of that stuff.  \n\nWe started with the Antipasto appetizer at $10.95.  This was a huge helping of artichoke hearts, roasted peppers, marinated mushrooms, olives, Provolone cheese and Prosciutto.  It tasted like there was some Mozzarella cheese as well in there.  The prosciutto wasn't exactly what we had in mind, but overall, it was a hearty helping that was more than enough for a party of two.\n\nPizza - We shared a small thin crust \"Sausage and Peppers\" pizza, at $9.95 (\"Mozzarella, our famous plum tomato sauce, topped with oven roasted peppers, sausage and freshly sliced garlic\").  We would have preferred if the pizza was in the oven longer, cooking the veggies and sausage a bit more.  The crust wasn't thin enough, in our opinion, especially for a restaurant that calls themselves \"New York Style Cuisine.\"  The pizza did taste a lot better the next day after we popped it in our toaster oven for a little while.\n\nWith the option to pick and choose your pasta and sauces at $9.95 a bowl, we ended up with the Angel Hair pasta and Garlic and Oil sauce.  We asked them to add some tomatoes in there too for a bit more color and taste.  I loved the slices of garlic in the pasta and it was a generous portion for what we paid.\n\nOverall, the service was average.  There was this one young Asian waitress that we noticed had excellent customer service skills and we wished she was our server.  We noticed that we were never told the specials of the day (we overheard the waitress telling another table), nor were we even offered the chance to look over the dessert menu (again, we noticed the waitress ask another table).  We did notice the staff of servers work as a team in helping each other clean up and set up.  However, should I return...I would try to get the female server to assist us.  \n\nIt was apparent who the owners were...a husband and wife team that manned the host desk and handled the register.  I'm not sure how long they have been in business, but it wouldn't hurt if they checked on the customers to see how we were enjoying their meal.

We were walking around the Palace Station and could not ignore the smells coming from this tiny bar.  Customers had heaping bowls of what could only be yummy goodness in front of them, AND there was a line for this place.

I had to ask those who were eating and those in line what to get  - and everyone was saying different things - but it all sounded wonderful!  We were sold!\n\nThe following week, we made our first attempt to chow at the Oyster Bar and you can imagine the defeated look on The Husband's face when it had 'just' closed for the evening.  Darn!\n\nThe next time we went early and on a weekday.  We didn't want to stand in line and we didn't want to get the stare down!  Haha!\n\nWith three of us, we figure we could all share.  So this is what we got:\n\n* Palace Pan Roast \"Served with steamed white rice.\" ($21.99) - This was my absolute favorite of the bunch.  It had the most flavor and I found myself hogging on this dish.  Customers weren't kidding when they said I had to get the pan roast!\n\n* House Gumbo \"A tasty Creole chowder made with seafood, gumbo file, okra, and Andouille sausage.  Served with white rice.\"  ($19.49) - The gumbo was pretty good too, and chunky.  But I just craving the flavors of the pan roast more. \n\n* Etouffee \" Shrimp, crab, and lobster with seasonings in this classic French Creole stew.\" ($17.99) - Their etouffe was good as well, but compared to the others, the pan roast and gumbo ranked higher.\n\nAll in all, it was all good, hearty and fatty goodness!  Yes, they do arrive in large pho bowls (large for Vegas, average size for other places).  I think it's more than generous for one person.

It was okay though because we didn't have to wait and we sat far enough down the bar to not have to acknowledge those in line still.\n\nWhile you wait, they serve up warm sourdough bread and butter.

The hostess almost  took us all around before seating us in the corner of  this huge dining area that was nicely decorated and had a lot of promise.  We were seated in front of a giant screen TV showing Thursday night football.\n\nAfter our beverage orders were taken, chips and three salsas arrived at our table.  There was one limed based tamarind sauce that the BF was practically drinking, while I had an affinity to the spicy red pepper color one.  We were very impressed already and couldn't wait for our orders!\n\nAfter deciding on the manaza $7 (apple rum, lime juice, and mint) for myself and the caprinha $8 for the BF, we realized our waiter was very new - at his job and at this restaurant.  It humored us nonetheless as he had trouble understanding and pronouncing our drink orders.  (The BF's caprinha was a bit too strong for his liking and my manzana was pretty much an apple mojito.  It was a lot tastier than his drink, that's for sure!)  \n\nWe decided to ask for his recommendation on food items since they had an extensive list.  He gave us some ideas on whether to order tapas or go straight for the main courses or do the mix and match.  \n\nWe decided to try out a bunch of different things by going for the Appetizer Sampler ($17) and the Mix and Match entrees of three items ($17).  We had the waiter bring out all the food together so we can enjoy it all at the same time.\n\nThe food was rather quick to come and just as well since we had already finished off a basket of chips.\n\nThe appetizer sampler came with two corn cakes that were sauced up and topped with guacamole.  The BF thought the cakes were pretty decent.   Two chicken(?) flauntas also came with the sampler.  I found it to be dried out and tasteless.  The adobo seasoned deep fried calamari was left in the oil too long, and the BF couldn't taste any of the seasonings.  These items were laid out on a bed of coleslaw and came with three dipping sauces - a dill based cream sauce, a chipotle sauce, and the lime-based tamarind sauce from earlier.  There was also a cup of queso fundido, which is melted cheese that you're supposed to dip your tortilla chips in.  However, once the cheese starts hardening up, it becomes one big goopey mess that's pretty challenging to eat with chips.\n\nOf the Mix and Match entree, we got one shrimp, lobster, and crab enchilada that wasn't to my liking.  The BF was appalled when he saw and tasted what appeared to be imitation crab meat.  Blah on that!  There was one soft flour tortilla (or you can choose the hard corn tortilla instead) holding what would be our carne asada taco.   It was alright.  Hiding behind that taco was one tiny ass what they call a burrito filled with dried carnitas.  The burrito was small enough to fit into the palm of my hand.  (Was this a kid size?)  Half of the plate was covered with rice and beans.\n\nWhen it came down to it, I found myself eating more chips and salsa than the actual food we ordered.  That's a bad sign.  The only leftovers we took were the cheese (so we could remelt it), the tortilla chips, and that lime tamarind sauce. \n\nService was fine.  It took awhile to get our orders in, but the food came out rather quickly.  Our waiter was nice and friendly, so no problems there.  I'm glad that we had a gift certificate too like Allison J. because it's definitely not worth the price they are charging!   \n\nSidenote: They offer a weekday happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm with $2 chips and guacamole, $3 nachos, $2 flauntas, $3 calamari, $1 margaritas, and $1 tequila shots.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hCxNymBRhx7eQZdxGCjvXQ"}

I spotted this little store as we whizzed past W. Flamingo Road and suggested, \"Make a right turn!\" to my bf.  As we drove up, we noted the \"Closed\" sign and knew a return visit was a must.  \n\nComing up with some cute names as \"Road to Hana\" and \"Strawberry Fields Way\", Cupcake Lane Bakery tantalizes your taste buds with their large selection of tasty morsels.  After reading through each and every description, my friend chose the \"Michigan Avenue\", the bf chose the \"Lake Tahoe Boulevard\" in honor of his hometown, and I went for the \"Hollywood Boulevard.\"  (I technically should have gone for the \"Lombard Street\" or the \"Ghiradelli Square\" in tribute to my hometown!)\n\nThe \"Michigan Avenue\" is a \"lemon-infused cupcake topped with a zesty lemon cream cheese frosting and garnished with yellow and blue sprinkles.\"  My friend was impressed and knew she was in big trouble since this location was not too far from where she lived.  Not being a huge lemon fan myself, I was hesitant.  It was rather refreshing and light.  Sweet without being tart, and actually, pretty darn good.\n\nThe \"Lake Tahoe Boulevard\" is described as \"Sitting around the campfire and enjoying our take on the S'more.  A chocolate cupcake with a marshmallow center, topped with chocolate ganache and crushed graham crackers and finished with a drizzle of chocolate.\"  It tasted like a brownie with a gooey center.  It was yummy, but not that special in my opinion.\n\nSticking with the basics, the \"Hollywood Boulevard\" is \"a vanilla cupcake topped with vanilla buttercream and sprinkled with stars.\"  I felt this was the best way to truly taste the cupcake and the cream on its own.  The cupcake was moist, flavorful, and could stand alone.  The buttercream was sweet, not overly done, and not dependent on the cupcake to stand. I was impressed.  \n\nCupcake Lane Bakery has a lot of promise.  The interior decor could use some help and they have two solo couches and two small chairs for sitting.  They also offer monthly special cupcakes, like this month's was the \"Times Square\" which had champagne in it.  At $2.25/each, or $23/dozen, they are definitely going to be fair competition.

Well, taking into consideration that you already KNOW it's going to be a two hour wait, you make the most of it.  \n\nWalking in and seeing the massive line on a Friday before a holiday, I was hesitant at first in joining the masses.  It definitely helps if someone will bear the wait with you at DMV, time goes by so much faster!  \n\nThe first line you join is to tell them why you are there in the first place, and then they give you a number.  That line moved at an average speed, it wasn't so slow nor was it zipping on by.  I overheard one girl telling her companion that she's going to find someone to pretend to be her mom because she needed a parent/guardian for whatever she was up to.  When it was my turn, I hurried to the next available CS rep and after explaining my situation, which took less than 5 minutes, I was given a number.

I brought nail polish and gave myself a couple of coats.  I watched as other patrons snacked on popcorn and nachos that were available from the snack stand.  (Yes, there's a snack store at the DMV.  Word is they sell hot dogs and ice cream too!)  I wandered why they would serve something messy like nachos that requires your fingernails getting all up into the cheese, and then having people touch various paperwork to proceed with whatever reason they are the DMV in the first place.  As I waited, the BF showed up with chicken nuggets (more finger foods), lots of messy dipping sauces,and a yogurt parfait from the nearby McD's down the street.  This definitely helps that you can leave briefly and come back without missing your number.  (I stayed anyways...just in case!)  \n\nWhen I saw A524 come up, I headed to window 7.

I peruse the selection of food available and am actually impressed with their variety.  They offer sashimi (tuna, salmon, red snapper) and some sushi rolls.  Behind the glassed case, there was tamago and unagi, but I didn't see these items available for taking.  The sushi lady cutting the fish said \"thank you\" to us about five times while we were getting our sashimi.  It felt odd when she said it repetitively and I can only assume it was because she wanted us to contribute to her tip jar.  (Yes, there was a tip jar in front of the sushi bar.)

You can choose from two types of noodles, veggies, shrimp, beef, pork, etc.  Sauces vary from spicy, garlic, teriyaki, etc.  The noodle dish the BF ended up with (spicy garlic) was pretty bland tasting though and I'm glad it wasn't me that ordered it.\n\nOther seafood dishes include crawfish (boiled with no taste!), frog legs, steamed fish, baked creamy mussels, baked creamy prawns, king crab legs, stuffed crab heads, salt and pepper crab, bacon wrapped shrimp, deep fried shrimp, shrimp and vegetables, clams, etc.\n\nThey have your standard Chinese dishes of wont ton soup, egg rolls, and potstickers too.  Some unique dishes included what was supposed to be a sweet fungus soup.  They had a few pretty looking dim sum dishes like a peach blossom bun (with red bean), twisted bun, sticky rice, etc.\n\nRandom things thrown into the bunch include pizza and miso soup.  Specialty of the day was roast duck.  On the far left section, they have a salad bar that remains untouched, including jello, canned lychee, and canned longans.  A small dessert section is available, but a very cool self serve ice cream area that includes eight flavors!  \n\nService: They are pretty good about clearing your plates and refilling your sodas.  And I do mean, really good about making sure you're filling up on soda!\n\nOverall, a large selection, but lacking in flavor for a lot of food items.

However, this past Saturday, we headed to Merkato for some eastern African fare - specifically, Ethiopian.\n\nLocated in the corner of a quiet strip mall, the dark windows can be deceiving.  Walking in, you'll notice a bar to the left and tables in the middle with a stage area in the back.  Guests of all ethnic backgrounds are dining (some Ethiopians, and by the end of the night, more non-Ethiopians).  We chose a table right in the middle.\n\nOur waitress brought our menus over and took our beverage orders.  (Unfortunately, no special Ethiopian drinks were available.)  Not realizing this was the Husband's first time, I immediately took ranks on what to order.\n\n* Yemisir Sambusa \"Flakey vegetarian pastries stuffed with spiced lentils\" ($1.50) - We ordered one of these, but I guess they forgot to put the order in for it.  It was just as well because we were so full with our main course that we were glad they forgot.  The waitress did apologize when I brought it to her attention.\n\n* Vegetarian Combo \"Great variety of vegetarian dishes.\" ($8.50) - This dish arrived laid out on a piece of injera, which is a large sourdough flatbread and has a bit of a spongy in texture.  It included Injera Salad, side salad, ground bean powder, yellow beans, green lentils, spinach, red lentils, and steamed cabbage and carrots.  Our favorites were the two variations of lentils, the spinach, and the yellow beans.  The bean powder one had a weird texture, similar to baby food.  Overall, everything was really good from the Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough for two to share.\n\n* Kitfo \"Ethiopian version of steak tartar, lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice 'mitmita'.\" ($8) - After seeing Andrew Zimmerman's Bizarre Foods, we recalled him eating this raw beef and was definitely game to try.  We were so glad we did.  The waitress brought it to the table and placed it in the middle of the injera that was already laid out with veggies.  It had delicate hints of spice from the chili powder, and had a nice taste and texture.  It didn't seem overly meaty despite it being rare beef.  It had quite simple flavors actually.  It was a nice addition to our Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough to share.\n\nA basket of injera bread also comes along to help you eat since there are no utensils for this part of the dining.  (You just use the bread to pick up whatever you want and pop it into your mouth.)\n\nThe waitresses were really friendly, although it does seem like they have sections. (Our waitress stepped out for a bit and I think we were forgotten.)  But it also seems like people really take their time here, so there's no rush for you to eat and leave. \n\nThe Husband felt he had a really good first experience with Ethiopian food, which is definitely a plus.  I personally felt the aftermath of the hot chili powder in the next day, if you know what I mean.  \n\nWe'd definitely go back again for more kitfo and to check out their other dishes too.  And it's a bargain to eat here!\n\nWe were interested in the Special Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony, but it cost $15.  So we figure we'd save it for another day.\n\nNo AMEX accepted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4Iqcne2F4qY8lahrPA81rA"}

Ricky Hatton fight was being shown on their TVs.  I guess this may also explain our initial service when we arrived.\n\nWe chose a table close to the bar so we can still see the screens while enjoying our dinner.  (There weren't any seats available at the bar.)  We actually had to ask for our menus since we were forgotten so quickly.\n\nWater and bread were soon to arrive and I was pleasantly surprised with the two hummuses offered alongside the olive oil and balsamic vinegar concoction.  We had to wave someone down so we could get our orders in and I guess everyone was too busy watching the fight.  \n\nWe decided to go straight for the beef since a place like STEAK should offer some really good stuff, right?  I went for the Petite Filet Mignon (8 oz.) with Provencal sauce ($27).  It comes with two sides - I chose the scalloped potatoes and saute mushrooms.  When my meat arrived, I can definitely say it was very rare, just like I requested.  The meat lacked flavor and the sauce was just okay.  The saute mushrooms were REALLY good though and thank goodness I got that to add to my  beef.  The scalloped potatoes were quite impressive - about six layers of potato slices and six layers of cheese came out in a hearty serving.  I found this to be quite generous.  The potatoes were just okay in my opinion, but the BF ate it all up!\n\nThe BF went straight for the Boneless Rib Eye with Bearnaise sauce and Cabernet Reduction sauce ($27).  (The waiter was nice enough to give him two sauces.)  He chose the mac & cheese and STEAK fries for his two sides.  The meat was more medium than medium rare unfortunately, so it was too much for me to chew.  He did find his steak to be medium rare in a different part of the beef though.  The mac and cheese was rather grainy, not how I particularly like it.  (I like mine smooth and creamy.)  We both liked the STEAK fries though - they reminded me of when my dad would have potato slices and pan fry them instead of deep frying them. (It made us want to go home and make them ourselves!)  The cabernet reduction was okay, but it was the bearnaise sauce that had me going.  It was so buttery and fatty, and oh so good!  Dipping the STEAK fries into that sauce was oh so good!     \n\nWe were both very full after our dinner and the additional serving of bread I had requested.  I did peruse the dessert menu and saw things like Cotton Candy, Marinated Berries, and Basque Cake that struck my fancy.  (All desserts were $10, except for the cotton candy which was $8).\n\nOverall, the food was just okay.  They had some really good sides, but their meat entrees were just average.\n\nService was much better once we got a designated waiter.  The staff were moving furniture around and left the doors open behind us causing a draft.  Our waiter made a point of closing the doors as other employees would continuously leave it open.  Thank goodness for him! \n\nThey are definitely trying to make this a neighborhood place to hang out with weekly events like: \n\nOpen Bar on Mondays and Thursdays from 5 pm to 7 pm.\nLive Music on Saturdays at 10 pm.  (We left before this started.)\nWine Tasting on Saturdays from 3 pm to 5 pm.\n\nWe would consider going back and checking out their wine menu more or even grabbing dessert and hanging out by the bar.  I don't think we would return back for the steak though.\n\n(I posted pics of our meal in the business profile.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "tvJVNWjgAoFuyXLDElNM_w"}

We were both surprised with the interior of this restaurant and the sushi bar.\n\nFor $50.08 per person, we had a three course dinner ahead of us.\n\nTo start, appetizers to choose from included Crab Cakes, Lobster Spring Rolls, Hawaiian Hamachi, Ahi Tuna Ceviche, Spicy Tuna Maki, etc.  We both chose the \"Kobe Carpaccio with soy, ginger, pearl onions and tempura shallots.\"  What a divine appetizer to start with!  Delicately sliced and presented on a rectangular plate, the crunchiness from the shallots and sweetness from the onions provided a perfect balance.  The Big F was in complete heaven!\n\nEntree choices ranged from Seafood Toban Yaki, Ahi Tuna Steak, Salmon Japonais, Chestnut Chicken, and Le Quack Japonais.  We both decided on the \"Petite Filet Mignon with truffle potato puree, grilled asparagus and uni butter.\"  The 4 oz. filet was cooked perfectly rare with a very good flavor.  The uni butter was a nice touch, but the potato puree and thick syrupy sauce made the meal so decadent and rich.  Instead of the grilled asparagus, we substituted with grilled broccolini.  It provided a nice crunch and contrast to the silky smooth potato puree.\n\nDessert was a \"Trio of Chef's Specialties\" that included their Kabocha Cheesecake \"Japanese pumpkin cheesecake with an almond cookie crust\", their \"Chocolate Ginger Mousse Cake\" with gold flecks, and vanilla bean ice cream.  A generous dessert after such a rich meal.  The mousse cake was light, but also quite dense with flavor and richness.  The cheesecake had a more unique flavor, especially with the nice crust.  And a scoop of good vanilla ice cream and fresh berries always complements a dessert well, and provides a nice finish.\n\nService was great.  Our water was always refilled before it ever reached the half mark, and our waitress was thorough and friendly.  She came by often to check on us and let us know the status of our order.  \n\nOverall, we had a fabulous experience with great food and good service.  It's a bit pricey for their sushi since they sell their nigiri by the piece!

It's about 1 pm on a Saturday and this restaurant isn't as busy as I had hoped.  (Not a good sign.)\n\nMy friend and her dining companion are already enjoying their Pineapple Buns with Egg Custard when we arrive. This is definitely a good sign!  (I'm not sure if the buns were hot when they came out, since I arrived a bit late.)  I enjoyed the sweetness of the custard, but the BF found it to be too sweet for him.\n\nWe ordered their standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings.  Both were standard.  They even had the Shanghai dumplings readily available as well.  They were tastier than Orchids Garden's version, that's for sure! http://www.yelp.com/biz/Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ?hrid=aU3RP30FNJmzdi1e-Ksa-g  And since the red vinegar is left out on the table, you can feel free to drown it as much as you'd like!\n\nWe also had Chinese broccoli, shrimp on tofu, crab/shrimp puff thing, shrimp rice noodle, and chicken feet in black bean sauce.  All were pretty good.  We even had the salt and pepper shrimp that came right out of the kitchen, so it was nice and hot.  \n\nThe downside?  Service was blah, I mean really blah.  The ladies never smiled or showed any personality whatsoever.  And the guys working there were not that great either.  They refilled our teapot, but left it on the far end of the table, out of our reach.  One lady was very indifferent as she slid our order across our table.  They were quick to clean up our plates once the bill was settled, which can be a good or bad thing.  (It usually means they want you out of their fast so they can have the table back.)\n\nInstead of sending the carts to the back for refills, they have waiters carrying a bunch of dishes in their hands or stacking them up and then placing them on a the cart.  I'm not so sure this is visually appealing.  \n\nThe bill was about $40 for four, not including tip.  We found this to be a bit more expensive than Orchids Garden and Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine since we know we ate less here.  (The BF wasn't so sure we got the correct bill even since the guy handling all the checks seemed quite unorganized.)\n\nOverall, the selection was there, although lacking in desserts.  (I did see the sweet tofu come out, but no custard tarts!)  They did have a few things that some of the other dim sum restaurants didn't seem to have.  Sometimes you get the feeling they are really trying to push a dish on you.  I mean, how often can the congee lady come by asking if we want congee?  Because the restaurant is a bit smaller and they don't push the carts into the back, you'll find the ladies 'idling' by one side of the restaurant, which was pretty much hanging out by our table.  They could really use a lesson or two in customer service.  If they can fix this a bit, I might even be willing to give them a better score rather than a stiff 3 star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8-HkVgPClpSli0ug3Uk-sQ"}

Not as busy as I would expect.  (Bad sign.)\n\nWe have a large party, five adults and four children.  As a result, we're seated in one of the larger tables in the room set off to the right of the restaurant.\n\nWe had barely sat down, especially with getting all the young kids seated, when the cart lady was hollering, \"You want dim sum!?\"  I was immediately put off with her attitude and probably would have left if it was just the Husband and I.  (My Chinese friend mentioned that her mom has a simple standard of dim sum restaurants - tea should be placed on the table before the food is brought out.  And she's right.  Growing up, that's the first thing I remember from my many dim sum brunches.  The waiters ask what kind of tea you want (usually as you're getting situated), and before the carts come, the tea is on your table.)\n\nBut in this case, we felt so pressured to order from the lady's cart and had baskets of food on our table way before the beverage guy came around to ask what we wanted to drink.  (I will say that he brought the tea and water over quickly and had our tea pots filled the whole time, of course with my help of flipping the cover up.)  \n\nWe got the typical orders of pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings.  Nothing special here, more dried out from over-steaming, if that makes sense.  We got a couple orders of beef balls and was surprised they didn't cut it in half (I've always seen it cut in half), nor was any Worcestershire sauce given.\n\nRice noodle dishes came by and I asked (in Cantonese) if they had Beef Noodle Roll.  She said they did, looked around, then asked if I wanted the Pork Spare Ribs one.  I said fine, and then she asked about the Shrimp one too, which I said was fine.  (Although she did try sneaking another one onto our table until we caught her in time to just say only one!)  And of course, the beef one never showed up.  \n\nI asked for Egg Custard Bun, and she said they had it, but tried passing off some yellow bean one as well.  We did eventually get the Egg Custard Bun and it was not good....hard, dry and old.  Bleh!\n\nDeep fried chicken wings were decent the first time around, but even better when we got them nice and hot.  The deep fried salt and pepper shrimp was also nice and hot when we got it too.\n\nOther dishes included steamed pork buns, chow mein noodles, Chinese broccoli (been sitting out too long), shrimp and tofu, chicken feet, and steamed beef tripe.  Nothing memorable though.\n\nThe Husband wasn't eating much from the very start and I had to wonder why.  He discreetly pointed to the HAIR that was sitting on his rice noodle dish.  Oh. Yuck.  (And unfortunately we did not say anything about it then or at the end since we were with guests.  But normally, we would have at least tried to point it out after we paid.  And no, you never say anything during your meal because we all know what happens at Chinese restaurants if you complain.)\n\nOverall, Harbor Palace is just not that good. We weren't that impressed the first time and we aren't impressed now.  And the service is beyond bad here.  Sure, I know everyone says you can't expect much on service at dim sum restaurants, but this places leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  It's not even worth tolerating.\n\nThey do have hot chili oil available on the tables, not just regular chili sauce.

We had been driving in search of a particular restaurant, only to find out it had closed down.  I was hungry.  We drove past Fukuda and decided to give it a go.  The waiter mentioned they had just started offering an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi option ($19.95/lunch or $25.95/dinner) the day before.  Did I mention I was starving?  After a quick peek of the menu, I was easily sold.\n\nIt was slow when we walked in for an early dinner, and we were the only ones seated at the sushi bar.  After a slow start, our sushi chef (Steve) kept our plates filled.  What makes Fukuda a bit unique about their all-you-can-eat is that they offer sashimi!  Yes, it's one of those things you can only order once and so we did.  They offer Spicy Tuna Sashimi, Spicy Albacore Sashimi, and Spicy Salmon Sashimi.  What makes it spicy is the thinly sliced jalapenos, a dot of Sriracha sauce, and one other sauce they put on top of it.  Amaebi is also the one other thing that is a one time only, and it comes with the deep-fried heads too.\n\nAppetizers we indulged in included the Baked Green Mussels, Shrimp Tempura and Soft Shell Crab (we got three orders!).  For nigiri, we had their Super White Tuna, Hotate, Masago with Uzura, Ikura, Saba, and Hamachi.  The Big F had two of their Salmon Skin Hand Rolls because Steve made their so enticingly good.  I made the mistake of getting the Lobster Roll.  I misunderstood and that it wasn't baked, but it was.  In the description, it's listed as \"Shrimp Tempura, avocado, cucumber and lobster on top.\"  However, it was filled with that crab mixture that I despise.  So blah on that one.  Other interestingly named rolls that we didn't get to try include Ugly Roll, Red Rock Roll, Green Valley Roll, and Dancing Eel.  There are a bunch of other rolls not included in the all-you-can-eat, including I Love Your Ass Roll, Monkey Brain Roll, and Flying Dragon Roll.\n\nFor dessert, choices include green tea or vanilla ice cream and mochi ice cream in Kona, mango, green tea, and strawberry.  The Big F really liked their Kona mochi, while I tried their mango, green tea, and strawberry.  The green tea one was a bit old, and I had to tell the waiter about it.  He apologized about it, and it really was no big deal.\n\nService was okay.  With us sitting at the sushi bar, we got our food pretty quickly.  They were good about clearing our plates and making sure the Big F's soda was refilled.  However, I had to ask the waitress to refill my tea cup every single time (four times).  I should have just asked for my own pot.\n\nFukuda is a pretty large restaurant with teppanyaki available should you so desire.  Apparently, many of their customers were asking about all-you-can-eat, so that's why they added it to their menu.  They also have a full bar available too.  Nonetheless, we were impressed because they offered sashimi and soft shell crab appetizer.  Let's see how long it lasts!\n\nUpdate! 09.13.08 - The Big F called to ask something about their All-You-Can-Eat Sushi special and they discontinued it as of a couple of days ago!  Haha!

With drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.\n\n* Trio of Duck Fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - This complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  A great way to start any meal!\n\n* Potato Focaccia - More complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although I found to be just okay, the Husband enjoyed it more. \n\n* Maine Lobster \"bacon-wrapped fritters\" ($17) - Skewered lobster with bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  A refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!\n\n* Roasted Beets \"burrata, walnut oil\" ($15) - The fresh Italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.\n\n* Filet Tartare \"american kobe filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread\" ($21) - Beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  Garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  So tastefully good, you don't need or want the bread.  \n\n* Shabu Shabu \"american kobe beef, mushroom consomme\" ($24) - A pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  A quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.\n\n* Angus Beef Cap ($46) - We all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  I initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  Cutting into my beef, it was more medium and I was saddened.  A quick glance around the table, and I realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  Lucky for me, the Husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (That act alone makes him a keeper!)  Once I cut into my newly acquired beef, I was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  \n\n* Mac & Cheese \"truffled\" ($12) - Yes, it's all that and a bag of chips.  So creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it's all over! So yum!  Worth ordering on its own.\n\n* Scalloped Potatoes \"caramelized onion & goat cheese\" ($12) - The onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  \n\n* Potato Puree Trio \"lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish\" ($14) - My personal fave over the other potato dish.  With so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  Very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.\n\n* Creamed Corn \"jalapeno\" - I guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  A slight bit of heat from the pepper and it's more creamy goodness.\n\n* Beignets \"Chocolate Pot de Creme, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, Madagascar Vanilla Creme Brulee\" - Take a spoon to the cr\u00e8me brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  Dipping wise, I liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.\n\n* Coconut Candy Bar \"Caramel Ice Cream, Toasted Almonds\" ($12) - A very fancy candy bar that's super sweet, and perfect for sharing.\n\n* Cucumber Martini - Surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.\n\n* Cherry Caiprihana - The Husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.\n\nThe service at Strip Steak was probably among the best.  There's a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  One of the more personal and better customer service experiences I've had in awhile.  Michael Mina obviously knows what he's doing with his food and his staff.  It's no wonder there's a cult following of his restaurants.  They also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (Most restaurants in the casinos don't have their own restrooms, so you're forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  But there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.\n\nMy suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  With a party of five or more, it's harder to share the appetizers and sides.  You'll share an intimate culinary adventure with them!\n\n4.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "XDYnLQC8ViZejuCDp4eCwg"}

He explained to us the differences between the saree, lehnga, and the suit (aka salwar kameez).  He had me trying on tons of beautiful outfits with the most gorgeous dupattas to go with them.  He was definitely complimentary with each outfit, which I did appreciate, but it was definitely a hard decision to look through and try on so many outfits.  The prices are a bit steep, but at the same time, I have nothing really to compare it to.  There was a woman there who helped me with a couple of outfits too, and she was nice as well.  It was all so overwhelming!\n\nThe BF tried on quite a few expensive achkans and he looked so handsome in them!  I stepped out of my dressing room and was taken aback to see him so nicely dressed!  They were pretty expensive as well, so it was challenging to pick through the bunch.\n\nMy only complaint was that they didn't go past a certain size, which could be challenging for those on the more curvaceous end. They offered alterations and were more than willing to assist you with helping you make a great decision.\n\nWe were told this may be the only place in Vegas where you can find such garments.

Walking into the restaurant, it's pretty straight forward how business is run here.  In front of every seat is a hot pot (or a hot pan) for your own cooking wishes.\n\nThe main two features of Swish is their shabu shabu menu and their sukiyaki menu.  \n\nFor shabu shabu, you get to cook your meat, seafood, or veggies in a broth.  (The menu says it's a seaweed broth, but it appears clear like water and I couldn't taste any seaweed in it.)  I ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size portion for $13.95.  They give you two dipping sauces, one is a ponzu type sauce and the other tasted like it had a peanut taste in it.  (Supposedly it's sesame though.)  They also give you a small dish of assorted veggies that include onions, carrots, green onions, tofu, mushrooms, spinach, and cabbage.  A small portion of two types of noodles and a bowl of rice are included with your shabu shabu order.  You can also request for shichimi (chili powder), layu (hot sesame oil), and chili paste for an additional kick.  It's a filling portion for the price you pay, and you can order additional rice or noodle for no extra charge.  (Double check on the noodle part though.)  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of shabu shabu.\n\nThe BF ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy Portion for $14.95.  They pour a bit of oil into your hot pan, and add a sauce where you pretty much grill your food into the sauce.  Throughout your meal, you'll add more grilling sauce to help cook your meal.  There's a bit more taste with the sukiyaki style, but shabu shabu would be considered healthier.  You also get the assorted vegetables, noodles, and bowl of rice with your sukiyaki order.  Be sure to ask for your raw egg too, you can either dip your food into it or pour it over your rice like the BF does.  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Chicken Fiesta, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of sukiyaki.\n\nOther items on the menu include appetizers like kimchee, spinach sesame salad, seaweed salad, and spicy seafood salad.  For dessert, you can find ice cream, mochi, and Japanese steamed cheesecake.  A few bento options are available to go too!\n\nService was good, but I heard it could be better.  In the beginning of your cooking, they offer garlic, radish, and green onions to your sauce or cooking pan.  The BF mentioned that when he eats there, the waitresses often cook the food for them.  However, when we went, they didn't offer.  He wasn't sure if it was because he goes at lunch or because he's with other guys.  =)  Haha!\n\nOverall, my experience at Swish was good.  At other shabu shabu places (like Koji's Japan in Orange, CA http://www.yelp.com/biz/cqQHvz1zvM_z2MbH0zjXBA#hrid:xzHUpQinpow0nRqocXAB0w/query:Koji),  they offer unlimited vegetables and a better dipping sauce.  Then again, Koji's is a bigger run operation than Swish.  I wish they would offer more vegetables though in their order.  \n\nLook out for their specials!  When we went, they offered 25% off Kobe orders, 10% off with Student IDs, and a frequent eater card.  They're about to open another location on Silverado Range and Maryland Pkwy in the late fall.\n\nOverall: 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.\n\nUpdate! 10/29/07 - Over the weekend, the BF and I were craving some Swish.  I ordered the Kobe Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size ($35.95) and the BF order the Kobe Rib Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy size ($38.95).  The meat was so tender and oh so good.  I think the prices just went up and they no longer offer a frequent eater card.  But they do offer a group discount for five or more.  And reservations are accepted for parties of three or more too.  Only udon noodles were given to us this time, and the veggies are still on the skimpy side in my opinion.  The Kobe Rib Eye is pretty good stuff, but it's a costly thing!\n\n(I added some pics of our dinner on the business profile section.)\n\nUpdate! They apparently offer a happy hour from 9 pm to 10 pm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "trC8BtTuNJniFaCaK1IQ4w"}

Unfortunately for me, Frederick's has never been really that accessible to me.  Just my luck that I was at Fashion Show Mall and I remember there being a Frederick's here.\n\nI asked one of the sales associates for some assistance and she helped me out.  She measured me and pointed me out in the right direction.  I grabbed a few and brought them into the dressing room.  I was a bit entertained listening to the gentlemen outside as they complimented their 'dates' on their choices and told them to wear it out of the store.  \"Don't take it off, just leave it on and I'll pay for it.\"  (The BF and I were amused as I think they were either strippers, escorts, or wanna-bes.)  The sales associate checked on how I was doing and warned me about the excessive company right outside my door should I open it and let her in.  She took a look and gave me the thumbs up.  It looked good to her.  \n\nI went to pay for my purchase and appreciated the personal attention she was able to give me despite the chaos going on with the rowdy customers too.

Of course you have to go outside and appreciate such a view because it is indeed spectacular.

There were also two guys that came along checking on things, cleaning up glasses, wiping stuff down, checking the floors, etc.  They are damn good about keeping you happy with your bottle service!

And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.\n\nWe arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.\n\nWe were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:\n\n* Atlantic Roll \"Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce\" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!\n\n* Spicy Tuna Roll \"Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers\" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.\n\n* Kona Calamari \"Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.\n\n* Sweet & Spicy Shrimp \"Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon\" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.\n\n* Chicken Satay \"With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.\n\n* Avocado Egg Roll \"Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.\n\n* Kahuna Sliders \"A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese\" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.\n\n* Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.\n\nWe didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.\n\nService was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)\n\nHappy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pm\nReverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pm\nFridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 am\n\nHH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.\n\nThey have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)\n\nYou can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!\n\nSide note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.

Unfortunately, Luv-It is closed on Sundays and Mondays and I've heard there are a few other frozen custard joints around the Vegas area.  A quick search pulled up Sheridan's Frozen Custard in Henderson.  Imagine our surprise and shock seeing this huge building with bright lights advertising Sheridan's.  They don't mess around with frozen custard here!\n\nAs we pulled into the parking lot, we passed by the drive through section and I was still in bewilderment.  Standing in front of this brightly lit dessert place, children and families were enjoying their own cold treat.  With music being played and fans overhead, Sheridan's invites you to take a seat along the bench way while enjoying your frozen custard.  With the glass windows all along the store front, you can easily watch your concoction being put together.  (I always appreciate glass windows because it forces the establishment to always maintain a clean front.)  You can soon tell why this is a chain business.\n\nPerusing their long menu, we were both intrigued by their \"Signature Concretes.\"  They advertise it as \"A concrete is fresh custard blended with your choice of a topping, but it's hard (like concrete).  You cannot drink it through a straw, you have to eat this treat with a spoon.\"  Since Sheridan's only sells Chocolate or Vanilla flavored custards, you kinda have to dress up your custard.\n\nWe both agreed to try the Grant's Grasshopper, \"fresh vanilla custard, green mint flavor and chocolate chips all blended together.\"  I watched as a couple of guys put together our concrete.  It didn't take too long and we both hungrily dug in.  (Check out the picture!)  It reminded me of a McFlurry from McDonald's.  It wasn't quite as 'concrete' as I expected it to.  It was actually more whipped and liquidly, and I think I could have drank it with a spoon.  I would have had to suck hard, but I think I could have.\n\nOverall, it was more ice cream than frozen custard.  I expected a more intense flavor, more egg-like at least.  A bit disappointing for frozen custard.

It was sweet, not overly milky, and a nice finish to my dinner.  The BF tried their version of the  Caipirinha (Cachaca, a Brazilian Rum, simple syrup and limes) $7.95.  \n\nSome buttered press-grilled bread was placed before us in a basket as we perused the menu.  For our aperitivo (appetizer), we tried their Mini Sandwich Cubano $6.95.  It's a smaller version of their Cuban sandwich and it's made with tender roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles and mustard on Cuban bread.  It's then press-grilled and served with mariquitas (fried thin green plaintains) or french fries.  It also comes with a garlic lime dipping sauce.  Don't be foolish and get french fries now, go for the plaintains for sure!  \n\nThus far, our experience at Havana Grill was garnishing a 4 star and I was excited about our entrees.  \n\nThe BF had their Boliche Mechado ($14.95), which is slow-cooked roasted eye of the beef round, stuffed with chorizo (Spanish sausage).  It's served with white rice, black or red beans, or moros.  He had them with moros.  The dish was luke-warm and lacked flavor.  If anything, it had an odd plastic wrap aftertaste that didn't fare well.  Same with the moros.  The BF ended up dousing the whole thing with hot sauce.  (I should mention that the waiter commented that this was his favorite dish, so I can only imagine his horror when we covered the whole thing with hot sauce!)\n\nI tried their version of the Lechon Asado ($14.95), which is leg of pork that is slowly oven-roasted and marinated in a mix of lemon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices.  There are also onions that are mixed into this dish.  I had this with white rice and red beans.  Although my pork was also luke-warm, it was tender and not dry at all.  It had a lot more flavor that the other dish, although my red beans need some kick as well.\n\nOverall, we were more impressed with our Cuban sandwich than our entrees.  Service was okay.  The waiter did come by often to ask how our meal was, but we did have to request that our water glasses be refilled.  Although they didn't advertise that there was live music on a Wednesday night, apparently there was a group practicing that evening.  It might be too loud to carry on a regular conversation when music is being played.  But then again, we figure we might come back to try out their free salsa lessons and grab some other apertivos instead of doing dinner.

Korean BBQ or Mr. Tofu.  After checking out their small and simple menu at Mr. Tofu, we decided we liked the 'full' Korean experience that D.J.K. was offering.\n\nWith no wait on the past Memorial Holiday for dinner, we were seated at  a booth right smack in the middle.  After perusing their extensive menu, we opted for their Dwaeji Galbi (Grilled Pork Ribs) at $22.95, the BF's favorite of Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap (Steamed rice with vegetables and beef to mix in the hot stone pot) at $14.95, and the Mul Naengmyeon (Buckwheat noodles with vegetables and meat in chilled broth) at $8.95 based on their picture.\n\nAbout nine different banchan was brought to us after our order went in.  It included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, salad, marinated octopus with pickled cucumbers, daikon, omelet, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, broccoli and some kind of dipping paste.  The salad had a nice dressing to it, and was pretty good.  The octopus was pretty yummy as well.\n\nWe soon discover they are out of Dwaeji Galbi, and ordered the Sanggalbi (Premium beef short ribs) at $26.95 instead.  The beef was good. It wasn't fabulous for the price we paid.  The Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap was average.  At first, the rice seemed a bit mushy.  But the stone pot that it came it really crisped up the rice very well.  (Apparently, this was the best the BF has ever had in terms of crispiness.)  The Mul Naengmyeon didn't quite look like the picture it was presented in.  It came with two slices of beef, one hard boiled egg, some veggies, and few pine nuts.  We asked the waitress about it before ordering and she was honest in her opinion, noting that although she enjoys it, it's a bit different for other people.  It's a cold noodle soup dish and I found it refreshing on a hot day.  They also give you vinegar and horseradishy mustard to mix it up with and this gives the broth the much needed quick.  \n\nBack in the city, I'm used to getting tea automatically.  But I guess here, you have to ask for it.  At least they don't charge for it though.\n\nI like how the tables are set up here.  At other Korean restaurants, they have to bring this container of hot coals to your table and it's pretty dangerous.  But here, they just turn it on with their gas stove.  And if you aren't going to cook the meat yourself, they simply put the cover on and it's flat like the rest of your table.  \n\nThe BF was still eating when the cashier girl brought our check to the table.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert.  (They offer creme brulee, ice cream, etc.)  Asking if they had any shikhye and learning they did not, we were a bit disappointed.  (Had to visit the Asian supermarket next door to get some!)\n\nService - we had the long-haired waitress.  There's this one short-haired waitress that was not so friendly.  When she initially asked us if we were ready to order, and we asked for another minute, she made a \"Huff!\" sound.  The BF and I looked at each other like, \"WTF?!\"  Thank goodness the smiley long-haired waitress ended up serving us the rest of the evening and she made up for the bad customer service of the other one.\n\nSide note: The restrooms have these gigantic square sinks.  Watch out for the first stall in the ladies' room 'cuz there's a huge puddle right in front and I think they might have a leakage problem per the previous yelper who mentioned the mess too.  \n\nReverse happy hour is 11 pm to 7 am with local ID only and that means 20% off.\n(You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile above!)\n\nI think they are related to Ginseng BBQ on Las Vegas Boulevard.  \n\nTotal bill with tax and tip: $65.50\nTotal stars: 3.5", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hb6n-TyLhEDdCyPyH3E3oQ"}

Seeing the sign for Shuseki for the first time, the menu fit right into what we were looking for.  Their menu offers along the similar lines of other izakayas and yakitori-type places.\n\nWe tried a little of everything: (All their skewered stuff comes in an order of one.)\n\n* Takowasabi ($3.99) \"raw octopus in wasabi dressing\" - A slimy texture mixed in with the heat from the wasabi.  It was an interesting dish, although I can understand why others may not enjoy it.  Eaten in moderation with other food is necessary.\n\n* Torihatsu ($1.00) \"chicken hearts\" - I like the taste of crunchy-like texture of chicken hearts done yakitori-style.  Plus, it had a nice taste to it with a fresh squeeze of lemon and salt.\n\n* Gyutan ($2.50) \"beef tongue\" - Again, pretty tasty stuff.  Speckled with sesame seeds too.\n\n* Sunagimo ($1.00) \"chicken gizzard\" - I like the texture of chicken gizzard as well, although the Big F wasn't as impressed.  It reminded him more like liver this time, so he passed after the first piece.\n\n* Tontoro ($1.50) \"pork\" - Pork on skewers are just good, period.  When the fat hits the grill, it's just  brings out the flavors that only pork can provide.\n\n* Kurobuta Sausage ($1.50) - I was afraid this was going to taste like a hot dog, but it actually had a lot more flavor than a hot dog.  It was pretty good.\n\n* Yakitori Chicken ($1.50) - Nothing special about this, tasted like chicken with teriyaki sauce.  It was probably they least enjoyed out of all we ate.\n\n* Buta Kakuni ($4.99) \"stewed pork belly\" - Fatty chunks of pork belly stewed in a soy sauce concoction along with a hard-boiled egg.  You should probably order some white rice with this dish 'cuz of the strong taste.  (The Big F said my version at home was a lot better.)\n\n* Sashimi Salad ($7.99) - Their sashimi salad was a combo of raw seafood that included kani, ebi, maguro, tako, masago, seared albacore and saba on a bed of field greens, cucumbers and daikon.  The sauce they used was pretty good, although I could always do without the imitation crab meat.  There might have been some other fish in there as well.\n\nThey have a bunch of other dishes that range from your basic sushi rolls to unique dishes (sea snails with kimchee sauce, bang bang chicken, simmered guts in miso) and ramen bowls (which we noticed other diners gorging on).  They have a lot of seating room, and a few tables in the back for sitting on pillows.\n\nLike other yelpers said, it's not a bad alternative to Ichiza.  They even sell Honey Toast for $6.50!  We definitely would like to go back and order a few other things off their menu.\n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "lnUXlYMh0UfrtVfnYo9mvw"}

For future reference, there are very cool romantic booths also available.\n\nWe went straight for their \"Made-Man Pastas.\"  The Big F chose \"Capo's Lasagna\" for $18.50.  It's \"lasagna pasta layered with Italian sausage, crushed meatballs, ricotta cheese and fresh herbs topped with Capo's special sugo and cheeses.\"  He also added a Homemade Italian Meatball for $6.  (Although it does say 'meatballs' on the menu, it's really one big meatball.)\n\nI chose the \"Tortellini Trafficante\" for $18.50, \"pasta rings stuffed with cheese served with proscuitto, peas and mushrooms in our creamy alfredo sauce.\"  I also paid $4 for the added Italian Sausage.\n\nBoth dinners are served with bread, butter, and a choice of Pasta Faggioli, Tony's Duck Soup, or their House Salad.  We both chose \"Tony's Duck Soup\" because the name sounded crazy enough.  They describe it as \"Italian egg drop soup with garlic, spinach, and a touch of crushed red pepper.\"\n\nThe soup was simple, but a bit too salty for my tastes.  Although the Big F enjoyed his lasagna, he thought it could be better.  He did finish it all up though.  My tortellini dish was good with its creamy sauce, but definitely very heavy.  (I had leftovers.)  The added Italian sausage wasn't particularly a favorite of mine either, perhaps my tastes aren't refined enough.\n\nAs a result, we never made it to dessert.  With names like \"Ma Barker's Cobbler,\" \"Leo's Lips Lava Cake,\" and \"Dillinger's Chocolate Covered Cannoli's,\" you're saddened you missed out. \n\nFor the ambiance, I'll give it a solid five stars.

Alright!  With a full hour to shop, we meandered through the aisles checking out their wares.  The store is pretty clean, including the seafood and meat section.  They have large aisles and they don't stack random things everywhere blocking the way.  \n\nThings are a bit more expensive than 99 Ranch and SF Supermarket, but it's not too overly priced.  The people working behind the seafood and meat section were a lot more pleasant than our experience with those at 99 Ranch, that's for sure.  IT looks like they have a greater variety of certain grocery items as well, a huge selection of fungi to choose from!  \n\nNonetheless, we were impressed.  If it's too late in the day, we'll be driving on over to Diho to get our fruits, veggies, meat and seafood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z_58BYHARPXTDr07VjBqbg"}

And the fab thing about this place, you can wear sneaks!  Nice!\n\nWith no line at all, I was skeptical thinking no one would be inside.  You pay by the window (try to get discount tickets or free passes if possible) and then you head down a few stairs.  First thing you see is the old Volkswagen and then the Brady Bunch squares.\n\nBathrooms are to the left with communal sinks for both men and women.  Quite a few stalls and there was hardly a line for them when I was in there.   \n\nWalking down the spacious hallway, you'll find this huge space with four rooms celebrating the 70s, 80s, 90s, and current hits.  Each room  has its own bar with its own VIP sections roped off.  They do a pretty good job keeping the music confined to its own respective room.  So, if you get bored of one room, hop on over to another.  And there's barely a line at the bar too.  (If you're in the 80s room and you get The Matrix, it's a two shot drink.  They make it so big though that it feels like a four shot drink.  It only costs 8 bucks and it tastes like shit.  But it'll definitely put you over right quick.)  Other drinks are pretty damn expensive though.  \n\nWe mostly hung out in the 80s and current hits room.  They also had Skip Martin, the lead singer of Kool & the Gang, performing near the 80s section.  \n\nOverall, Polly Esther's at The Stratosphere is a pretty cool place.  It's not uptight like some of the other clubs down the strip and it's kickback casual for people like me who hate dancing in heels.  Lines are non-existent for getting in, buying drinks, or using the restrooms.  So, that always scores a point with me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1zE2M99PGgMrnvXteHTKcA"}

Walking in, you'll notice a small assortment of single serving cakes.  We didn't know which cake to try, and the ever so personable and gracious owner and pastry chef, William Galdamez, brought out some samples for us!  \n\nWe tried the Creme Brulee Cheesecake ($3.75) and the Apple Tart.  The creme brulee had a delicious crust on the bottom, a layer of creme brulee, then  cheesecake, and the top is nicely crisped as traditional creme brulee is.  Yummy!  The apple tart was a lovely surprise too!  I'm not usually fond of the crust of tarts, but their version is unlike any other I had and was very enjoyable.  We bought home their Kahlua Chocolate Mousse Cake ($3.75), a lovely dome of soft and delicious chocolate. Again, the crust was oh-so nice and was just a joy to eat.  Other flavors available include Cheesecake and Lemon Mousse among others.\n\nHomemade cookies are available by the pound, $4.50.  They offer four varieties of cookies - Oatmeal, Chocolate Chip, Sugar, and Butter.  Cookies are very enjoyable as well and can create a very bad habit if you find a pound in front of you.\n\nWorld of Cakes does sell cupcakes, but this isn't their specialty.  You'll find their version of cupcakes unlike any other place.  Their visual appearance alone doesn't even resemble a cupcake.  I have yet to try theirs.\n\nThey also sell artisan breads for about $4 a loaf that include olives or raisins.  These crusty breads come from the owner's friend's bakery and is a nice treat from your boring regular bread from the supermarket.\n\nBigger cakes are also available made to order.  Cake flavors include Lemon Chiffon, White Chiffon, Carrot Cake, Chocolate Chiffon, Tiramisu, and Marble.  Cake fillings include Lemon Cream, Vanilla Bavarian, Chocolate Bavaria, Chocolate Mousse, White Chocolate Mousse, Cream Cheese, and Pineapple Cream.  Moving onto Icings, you can choose Whipped Cream, Buttercream, Chocolate Ganache, and Rolled Fondant.\n\nAs of now, they are open daily from 10 am to 7 pm, and closed on Sundays.  This may change once business picks up due to road construction right in front.\n\nWorld of Cakes is definitely worth a visit!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mI8qRS8DxFSsPm9eCCd7-A"}

I have the AIDS Walk the next day and I'm thinking a nice foot massage might do the trick.  \n\nThe BF and I are in search of a place that offers foot massages without the hidden extra perks of such establishments that have neon signs and are open 24 hours.\n\nFrom the street, I see a sign advertising \"Foot Massage and Reflexology.\"    We drive up to the establishment and I am concerned with the tinted windows.  (Is there a doorbell we have to ring to get buzzed in?  No.)  As we enter the doors, we see the prices for foot massage and reflexology treatments.  \n\nBasic Foot Spa and Massage: $35 for 30 minutes\nFoot spa, massage and reflexology: $50 for 60 minutes\nArms, ears, neck, shoulders, foot spa, massage, and reflexology: $70 for 90 minutes\n\nThey also offer memberships which ultimately means purchasing your massages in bulk.  \n\nWe both opt for the 30 minute massage and foot bath.  We're brought into the first room that has about four reclining seats.  Within the dimly lit room, there's a TV in the corner.  Mini bottles of water are handed to us as we take a seat and remove our shoes and socks.  Two ladies come in with a foot tub filled with our herbal foot bath.  Our feet soak in this hot bath for a few minutes.  They are then dried and the massage begins.  We're both tired and could easily fall asleep as our calves and feet are pressed and massaged with 'a special herbal balm'.  After the massage ends, our feet and calves are wiped down with a hot towel and our socks and shoes are put back on.  The half an hour ended too quickly.  \n\nOverall, May Sky does exactly what it advertises...foot massages.  I don't think we really got any 'reflexology' work done since we didn't get the longer treatment.  Nothing fancy about this place, but it serves its purpose.\n \nOpen daily from 11 am to 2 am.\n\nSide note: They offer a $5 off 1 hour visits with the brochure coupon you can pick up in the store.

This place has come highly rated by quite a few people and I was pretty excited.  \n\n* Pho Beef \"Combination of slices of rare beef, cooked brisket, & beef ball\" (Medium $6.50) - The first thing I noticed when the bowl was placed in front of me was how small it was.  The bowl was of average size, but it was the portion inside the bowl that looked a bit disappointing.  I looked at the Husband and he was thinking the same thing.  When I started to stir the noodles around, they were stuck together in one big clump.  Not good.  And it also took a bit longer for an order of pho to come out, and I have a feeling my noodles were sitting in the bowl too long before it was brought out to me.  The broth smelled great, but tasted average.  There wasn't that much meat in my order either.  Sure, it's a medium and they have the large and x-large family sizes available, but I'm usually pretty content with the smallest size offered at Vietnamese restaurants.\n\n* Grilled Chicken \"Marinated, then grilled.\" ($8.50) - The Husband couldn't decide between the Chicken with Basil Sauce or the Lemongrass Chicken.  (The Golden Baked Chicken was unavailable this evening.)  The table next door got the Grilled Chicken and the waiter (owner?) suggested that was a better choice over the three.  It came with a side salad, rice, and a dipping sauce.  The Husband said it tasted like he expected it too, and appreciated that it wasn't dry.\n\nOverall, I was a bit disappointed with my first experience with Bamboo Bistro.  Pho isn't what they are known for, so that was my mistake in ordering it.  Next time I'll have to try their Beef Carpaccio, House Specials, or the 7 Courses of Beef.\n\nWith what looked like a husband and wife team running the floor, they were efficient and friendly.

The waitress came by to ask if she could get us beverages and you gotta get Sweet Tea ($1.50)!  (Yum! Yum!)  \n\nPerusing through the menu, we decided to split an order since dinner was happening in a couple of hours.  We opted for the whole order of Shorts Ribs with gravy ($17.99), which is \"slowly cooked beef ribs, seasoned to perfection with gravy or BBQ.\"  The whole orders come with three sides and our choice was the collared greens, macaroni and cheese, and fried okra.  (Check out the picture!)  A half order was available for $12.99, but  I'm not sure how many sides you get with the half orders.\n\nThe wait wasn't too long for our order to come, despite the warning on the menu saying there's a 20 minute wait for fried items.\n\nThe short ribs were tender and came off the bone easily.  It was flavorful and went well with the gravy.  The macaroni and cheese was a bit bland for my tastes though, but the collared greens fared a bit better.  The BF said they could have cooked the greens a bit longer for what he likes.  We especially liked the fried okra though.  It was my first time having that and we wished we had two orders of it instead.  \n\nOther sides available included yams, black eyed peas, red beans and rice, potato salad, corn bread dressing, cabbage, string beans, and rice and gravy.  Entrees included oxtail, catfish, chitterlings, gumbo, meatloaf, fried chicken, and liver and onions.  Dessert choices were peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding.  \n\nService was good.  The waitress refilled our sweet tea before we had to ask and before we were even done with our first glass.  We definitely appreciate that.  She also brought out an extra plate for us so we could share our entree.  And she asked if we wanted any dessert before giving us the bill too.\n\nOverall, the sweet tea, ribs, and fried okra were good.  The other sides were just okay.  We felt that it was a bit pricey for what we got, and both expected a larger platter of ribs.  We wouldn't mind going back to try out what else they had to offer.\n\nSidenote: I'm not sure if it's intimidating or not seeing this very tall man  wiping down tables as his gun and badge bounce off his hip.     \n\nThere's an 18% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\nUpdate! 03/14/08 - The BF was craving their short ribs, so we ordered them up again.  This time they were  A  LOT more generous with their portions!  (It makes me wonder if we got shafted the last time - check it out and compare the pictures yourself!)  I wish we remembered not to get the mac n cheese, but we got black-eyed peas and fried okra this time too.\n\nI went for the Small Seafood Gumbo which had crab (hard to eat), chunky sausage, chicken, okra, and rice.  It's pretty generous for a small portion, but there's not all that much seafood in it.  It's super gooey from all the okra 'stuff' though.  \n\nThis time we got complimentary cornbread pancakes, two each and a side of butter.  What a nice treat while you peruse the menu.

He thought they were pretty loaded compared to what he gets from Roberto's Taco Shop.\n\nThe self service \"salad bar\" had fresh cucumbers and radishes to neutralize the heat from the chipotle sauce, green hot sauce, jalapeno peppers, carrots, and onions, and fresh green onions.\n\nThe gigantic horchata was pretty good too and is a must with all Mexican food.  \n\nOverall, Viva El Taco is another chain among the chains of Mexican food in Las Vegas.  It's definitely better and more authentic than a Del Taco or Taco Bell any day.  It's casual enough for a quick bite as well.\n\nSidenote:  They have coupons offering $0.99 bean burritos, three rolled tacos, beef tacos, and chicken tacos.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FcbmXlWUcbrYJeEDKBywEA"}

A tiny line with a roped off entrance with a guy checking ID to get in.  Why all the fuss?  \n\nEntering this dark and smoky atmosphere, make a quick left and get a nice stamp on your hand.  You'll hear music pumping through the speakers and see a small dance floor with a deejay spinning.  They even have a lighting system that makes you feel like you're at a dance club.  Take a quick tour and you'll see a bunch of areas for your group to lounge while enjoying some hookah.  (I tried the grape and watermelon one...although I could have sworn the watermelon one tasted more like peach!)  There are some semi-private areas too.\n\nWalk into the back and you'll notice another area to dance.  The BF was really digging this place as he's been to a few hookah lounges.  The servers were pretty nice and friendly, although you'll have to catch up with them when it gets busy and because the music is so loud.\n\nIt's on the other side of town for us, but it looks like we'll be making a return visit.  Cool atmosphere and cool crowd too.  You can shake your booty and burn off some calories here.\n\nSidenote:  There are two unisex bathrooms available.  If there's a line at one, keep on walking around and you'll find the other.\n\nUpdated: 05/29/07 - I heard they only play electronic music once a month.  So, that night we were there was a special event.  Supposedly on the regular days, it's more chill like your typical hookah lounge!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XMoicaCYrGRX0IT_1kkUlw"}

Unfortunately, the service is my biggest complaint about this place.  I'm not sure if it's because the waitress wasn't used to working our section (our table was the only one she had in this section), they were understaffed, or she just disappeared a lot.\n\nNot once, but twice, someone from our party had to go look for our waitress.  It took awhile for the food to come out, but then again, we noticed other tables hadn't gotten their food yet either and they arrived before us.\n\nOne of the girls mentioned that we still hadn't received any bread yet, and that almost caused an uproar.  (Did I mention there were ten hungry girls at my table?)  When the bread arrived, round rolls that reminded me of a soft pretzels and big fluffy rolls with whipped butter, were vacuumed up!\n\nOur foot arrived soon after, and maybe it's because we all stuffed ourselves silly with the bread, but pretty much no one finished their meal!  \n\nI ordered the \"Spit Roasted Free-Range Chicken (1/2 Chicken) for $19.99.  All entrees include vegetables, a choice of house rice pilaf, baked potato or mashed Yukon potatoes.\"  You can add a stuffed potato for $2.50 more.  I chose the Baked Potato and it was a huge spud!  Of course, my chicken was way too much for me to eat, but I devoured as much of it as I could.  There were parts of it that were dry, but that's a bit expected with roasted chicken, right?\n\nOther girls ordered the Broiled NY Steak Caesar Salad or the AAB&G Grilled New York Steak Salad for $11.99 and their portions were huge.  The steak doesn't come in strips, it's a piece of steak sitting on your salad leaves!  The French Onion Soup Gratinee for $5.99 was also generous too.  And the Buttermilk Battered Chicken Fingers ($8.99) remain untouched, only because the girl had stuffed herself already!  We saw the French Onion & Cheddar Cheese Loaf ($6.99) go by and it was huge!  Definitely something you want to share!\n\nOne thing we did appreciate was the waitress was able to change a last minute order of Oysters Rockefeller ($11.99) to Blue Point Oysters (12 each at $15.99) without a hitch.\n\nWhen I went to pay my bill, I wanted to pay separately so I could put it on the credit card. Unfortunately, the waitress made me wait until the rest of my party got their cash together before she took my card.  (Other restaurants have no problem running my card first, with the added gratuity, while the rest of the check is still being calculated!)  So that was a pain to have to wait even longer.\n  \nOverall, it's not a place that I would normally choose to eat at in a hotel on or near the strip. But it fit the budget we had and satisfied the meat desires of our group.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZCkh7L0HyZ8L9RclT7A_cw"}

It's so tasty, especially when you dip it in the accompanying fish sauce concoction.  I actually find myself craving it, and to me, that's a good sign!\n\nThey have Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) for $2.75, which is a steal! I have yet to try their version, but you'll probably find us here grabbing a couple to go the next time we have a flight out.\n\nThe BF loves their Ca Phe Sua Da $3.23 (Vietnamese Iced Coffee with Milk).  They don't have it brewing at your table though like other Vietnamese restaurants.  It'll come in a plastic to go container with shaved ice, but it's pretty creamy.  Apparently they do more than use that Cafe Du Monde coffee to make theirs.  (We asked!)\n\nTheir Guyabano Shake (with or without Pearls) $3.49 is pretty yummy too.\n\nThey do have your standard pho noodle soups and grilled pork chops, but also some unique things like pork blood in rice porridge or vermicelli noodles served with escargots.\n\nService is nothing to rave about.  It's pretty slow there.  The times we went, there was only one person manning the register, making beverages, cleaning the tables, and bringing the food out.

I'm not too picky with styles, so there's definitely some flexibility there should it not turn out too perfect.  The great thing about the hair services at Aveda is that it includes a stress relieving treatment, a hand and arm massage, make up touch up, and a mini facial.  (Although I have never been offered any kind of make up touch up whatsoever though.)\n\nMost recently, I returned for another haircut ($15) and a Botanical Hair Treatment ($20).  Much to my surprise, my haircut was free since I was donating it to Locks for Love!  Very cool!  (Looks like I may never have to pay for a haircut again then!)  This was obviously a newer service since I donated my hair the first time and they didn't know anything about it then.  Nice to see this new feature.\n\nSince I was using a Groupon, I needed to add a last minute service and was able to squeeze an Elemental Nature Pedicure ($25.50) while there.  The pedicure was just okay.  The girl who cut my hair also did the pedicure and I could tell she just didn't have a lot of experience with pedicures.  It's supposed \"to include grooming of nails, cuticles, exfoliation, massage, and treatment masque completed with polish.\" First off, the exfoliation part - the paddle that they use to help scrub the bottoms she also used to scrub the tops of my feet.  Uh, ouch.  Delicate skin there! That was a huge sign of the rest of my experience.  I then mentioned that she might want to trim my nails first.  She either didn't hear me or ignored me because she chose to lightly file them instead.  (I thought maybe there weren't allowed to cut nails?)  She cleaned up the excess polish and all, but there's no place or machines to help dry them.  Off you go with those cheap paper thin sandal things.  (The worst part was that the sandal broke walking through the parking lot to the car, so now my clean feet were dirty black!)  I allocated three hours for this visit and was out by two!  When I got home, I had to retouch a lot of it.\n\nAnd my most recent experience was with the Ultra Stress Relaxation Treatment ($50).  It's a lighter \"massage that includes upper body, complete hand and arm, leg and foot massage.\"  When I made the appointment, I specifically requested a female and they said sure.  When I go there, I was assigned to a male.  They were able to change that quite easily thank goodness.  They start you with a foot bath while you get your consultation.  I'm not sure if it's the Aveda way or my student's, but she started me facing upwards.  She had me flip twice - so I ended up facing upwards again.  A little too much flipping in my opinion.  One of the best things they do is end with this Peppermint Oil on your upper back that makes you feel lit.  \n\nOverall, the Aveda Institute is a hit or miss - just really depends on your student.  You have to be open to a little experimentation and have some free time on your hands.  The extra little bit of pampering they do does make it that much nicer.  I don't think I would go back for a manicure or pedicure, just doesn't seem like their specialty.\n\nKeep your eyes out - word is that they are going to be featured on Groupon again soon!  \n\n3.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "uRFN1CH9l9JVMkpq6Bai6A"}

When we walked in, we had our pick of tables and chose one in the far back.\n\nThe Husband chose the Cuban Sandwich \"with Roasted Pork, Ham, Mayonnaise, Mustard, Pickles & Swiss Cheese\" ($8.50).  He was quite impressed and thought it was better than some of the other Cuban sandwiches he's had from Cuban restaurants.  He particularly liked the sliced roasted ham pieces too.\n\nI chose the New York Steak Sandwich \"with Horseradish Mayonnaise topped with Fried Onions\" ($8.95).  I loved the thinly sliced fried onions and the hearty sandwich overall.  The steak came out just as I ordered it to be - medium rare.\n\nBoth sandwiches came with seasoned fries which were very good!  We'd order more fries as a side if we could!  \n\nService - the waitresses were friendly but not the most efficient.  Our waitress was very attentive in the beginning with getting our drink and food orders.  But someone else brought our food out and no one came to check on us.  It took a lot of waving to get our waitress back to ask for more condiments.  The Husband was practically done with his sandwich before I could get their attention.  (I also noticed other customers having to help themselves to the A1 sauce, ketchup, etc. since the staff weren't around.)  There were at least two waitresses on the day we went and they were both near the front and didn't look back our way.  \n\nThere was also a slight mix up with food delivery - A few minutes after we ordered, an appetizer appeared on our table.  We thought it was a complimentary item but realized that it was quite a generous appetizer and I remembered seeing it on the menu.  So we waved down the guy who brought it out to us and told him it wasn't ours and indeed, it was for another table.  So, they definitely have to pay more attention to the tickets and the tables.  \n\nAnother note, the busboy was a bit too anxious with wanting to clear our plates.  The Husband was still holding his sandwich when the busboy asked if he was done so he could take his plate.  (I was definitely still eating.)  I get the feeling like you're being rushed when plates are cleared too quickly.\n\nWe did appreciate the chef coming out to every table to see how the food was, and that was one thing that we didn't have any complaints about at all.\n\nOverall, the food was good and we purchased more groupons as a result.  Those slight service issues can be overlooked with a simple and tasty lunch menu offered.  There were no daily specials at the moment since the groupon special was running.  They also offer a free appetizer with a yelp review, so we'll see if they still honor that on our next visit.\n\n4.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3mrp7wim9_rCMTO3kRp3Rw"}

Armed with a few other experimental eaters, we ventured into Champion to see if it was anything to talk about.  We can definitely say we were pleasantly surprised!\n\nAfter you walk through the doors and past the little grocery section of ready to order foods and what not, you'll pass by the sauce making section on the way to your table.

Not sure on how to order, we started with four combos.  The waitress was quick to let us know that we were ordering too much food.  She suggested one or two combination of hot pot assortments and then adding additional meats and the sort.  We ended up with the seafood platter and lamb hot pot, and of course, the veggies and tofu that come with it. The seafood platter had shrimp, mussels, imitation crab, and squid.  The lamb had frozen slices of meat rolled onto the plate.\n\nA little gas stove was placed in the middle and a hot pot with a divider was placed on top.  There were two different broths in there - one spicy and one not.\n\nWe also made a visit to the sauce making bar where you can add sesame oil, chili oil, garlic, cilantro, green onions, sesame sauce, etc. to your own concoction.\n\nIn the end, we added more lamb and mushrooms to our hot pot order.

The waiter inquired about our beverage choices before telling us about the menu.  He soon returned with a cart that held examples of the cuts of beef available, the vegetables that accompanied it, and other various dining choices.  It can be a bit overwhelming as he goes over what the restaurant offers, but not to worry since it's all on the menu anyway.\n\nThey start you off with a large loaf of bread, and it doesn't matter if you're dining by yourself or with a group, you still get this loaf of onion bread.  (I did ask what they did with the leftover loaf, hoping that they might donate it or something.  No luck.  Into the trash it goes!)\n\nFor salads, we both chose the \"Morton's Salad with Morton's Blue Cheese Dressing, Chopped Egg, and Anchovies.\"  It's a combination of romaine and iceberg lettuce leaves.  It would help if they cut the leaves down a bit because it was a mess to eat.  The dressing was alright, nothing special about it being their own blue cheese dressing.  The anchovies added the perfect saltiness, but I'm sure the anchovies were not their own.\n\nWith our special dinner of a single cut of filet mignon comes a choice of an appetizer.  I went for the \"Broiled Sea Scallops Wrapped in Bacon with Apricot Chutney.\"  The Big F had the \"Jumbo Lump Crab Cake with Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce.\"  My scallops were good, and what isn't good with bacon?  The sweetness of the chutney added a nice contrast as well.  The crab cake was pretty good too, made with lots of crab and less filler.  They could do a lot better though with the presentation of our meal.  The Big F's plate looked like something was missing!  \n\nHowever, the real problem we both had was with the beef.  Although it was perfectly cooked to how we ordered it (rare), it was ultimately tasteless.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I had my share of filet mignons and I'm used to a smooth taste where the meat melts in your mouth and has you feeling like heaven landed in your mouth.  This wasn't the case here.  It wasn't just my opinion about this tasteless beef, the Big F was on the same page as well.  We ultimately had to ask for Worchestire sauce to douse it so it had some flavor.  (It does come with a side of Bearnaise Sauce, but I've had much better.)  Perhaps we should have said something to the staff about our entrees, and yes, that was our mistake.  It was my first time dining at Morton's and I figure this is how they do their filets. (The Big F usually gets their Cajun Ribeye Steak when he's there, so he had no previous experience with their filet mignons either.)\n\nOur choice side dishes were the \"Macaroni & Cheese with a Hint of Spice\" and \"Lyonnaise Potatoes.\"  The mac & cheese was alright.  I prefer it to have a smoother and creamier texture, but this had that graininess in it.  The Big F did like their choice of pasta for it though.  The potatoes were pretty tasty, cooked with lots of onions.\n\nFor dessert, the choices were either Chocolate Cake or Key Lime Pie.  Well, I wish I knew it was actually called \"Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake\" because it was really good.  It had a molten center that was oozed out so nicely when I cut into it.  It was probably the saving grace of the meal.  But because I had finished my tasteless piece of meat, I was too stuffed to finish my dessert and ice cream.  (In retrospect, I would have brought the meat home and recooked it instead.)  The Big F's Key Lime Pie was good too, not as good as the Chocolate Molten Cake though.  We probably would have finished that as well if we had put the meat to the side.\n\nService was good at some points.  Our beverage glasses were never empty due to the water boys constantly refilling our glasses.  Our waiter checked on us once during our meal, and that's when we asked for the Worchestire sauce.  But I don't recall him coming around much after that.\n\nOverall, my meal at Morton's Steakhouse was disappointing.  Perhaps my taste preferences just don't align with how Morton's does their filet mignons here.  They have raving reviews, so maybe it's just my bad luck that I got a tasteless piece of beef.  Anyway, I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon though.\n\nThey do have a happy hour and reverse happy hour.

Having recently discovered this lovely treat, the words \"stuffed french toast\" had me salivating.\n\nI was actually up early enough this past weekend to enjoy a nice brunch, so the BF and I headed to The Maple Tree.  Imagine my surprise when we pulled up into this tiny strip mall.  We pass by this area all the time and have never even noticed the place; it's definitely a hidden gem!\n\nWalking in around noon, there's a steady stream of customers with a few empty tables.  We're seated immediately and I'm in search of the stuffed French toast.  Our waitress, Karen, comes by to take our beverage orders and she soon learns that it's our first time.  She gave us a bunch of great recommendations from across the menu, which cemented our choice for brunch.  The BF already saw their version of the Monte Cristo and with Karen's suggestion, he was easily sold.  I was tempted with the stuffed French toast or one of their skillets, but Karen sold me on the crab cakes.\n\nWe were anxiously awaiting our orders and I noticed immediately that two of the diners next to us also got the crab cakes!  \"The New England Benny\" (Two crab cakes, served on English muffin halves, topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, served with country potatoes. $9.25) soon arrived as well as the BF's \"The Maple Tree Monte Cristo\" (A French Toast sandwich with thinly shaved ham, turkey, and Swiss cheese, deep fried to a golden brown, dusted with powdered sugar and served with pure maple syrup or raspberry puree. $8.95).\n\nSince the Monte Cristo comes with either maple syrup or raspberry puree, the BF paid the extra $1.25 to get both sauces.  It also came with a side of fresh fruit with is nice complement to this hearty meal.  He preferred the raspberry puree over the syrup in the end, and he ate it all.  It was a nice cross of sweet and salty at the same time for me, and the BF really appreciated that the ham they used was salty enough for the contrast.  He finished off his entire meal.\n\nI don't usually order Eggs Benedict or anything with hollandaise sauce for that matter, but the crab cakes was what got me!  And it was definitely delicious!  Karen told us the crab cakes are homemade and you definitely get the taste of crab, not a bunch of stuffing.  They also add spices that give it a nice kick.  My plate was licked clean!  The BF said the next time we eat here, he's going to get my dish because he liked it over his Monte Cristo!\n\nService was great too!  The waitresses are constantly walking around refilling coffee mugs and water glasses. You probably won't see them standing by the side gossiping because they really work!  And everyone is super-friendly too!  Other waitresses had heard the BF was getting the Monte Cristo and asked him what he thought of it.  We also overheard other waitresses with the other customers and they really try to make you feel at home, especially if it's your first time at The Maple Tree.  And dishes are cleared quickly too!  \n\nOverall, The Maple Tree is a great place for breakfast, brunch and lunch.  Not only will you see your staple breakfast items, but you'll find Fish N Chips, Tuna Melts, Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers, Roasted Chicken, Baked Ham, and other goodies on the menu.  They also offer a few things for the Juniors and the Seniors!\n\n(You can see pictures of our brunch in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "h4GmXUxM07MTOlMiGa0KuA"}

We've seen advertisements for a second location soon to open, and realized they were the sister restaurant of The Egg & I.\n\nWe walked in around 1:30 pm and the place was pretty full.  We were seated with only a minimal wait and newspaper menus were presented.  \n\nI was immediately drawn to the Corn Beef Hash (Corn beef hash grilled then topped with two eggs any style.  Served with Works potatoes and toast or a banana nut muffin. $9.25) although I also wanted a skillet too.\n\nThe BF was pretty set on getting their cincy chili, but I was able to convince him to get their Chili Skillet Works (Start with a layer of Work's potatoes, then pile on the ingredients, top with a mixture of cheddar and jack cheese and your choice of two eggs any style.  Served with a fruit garnish and a choice of toast or a banana nut muffin.  Your choice of Works chili or cincy chili and diced onion.) for $7.95 instead.  This combined the best of both worlds - a skillet and the ever famous cincy chili!\n\nHe also ordered one of their bottomless flavored coffees for $2.25.\n\nWhen our orders arrived, I was more than impressed.  They definitely give you hearty portions!  My corn beef looked like the whole can was under my two sunny side up eggs!  But the real winner of the day was the BF's chili skillet!  Oozing with cheese in all directions and full of flavor, I couldn't help but dig into his meal instead!  \n\nService was good - the waitresses were pleasant and friendly and the busboys are quick with cleanup.  They definitely have a system here and it works.  People work as a team and it definitely makes them more efficient.\n\nThey have a bunch of other typical breakfast items to choose from as well, and what looked like a huge tostada salad.

I tried a bit and found it 'interesting.'  The sandwich was decent as he finished it all, and the Works potatoes was a generous portion because he had a lot leftover.\n\nThe Husband was craving the Country Fried Steak \"A hand battered chicken fried steak, topped with Grandma's country gravy and served with two eggs, Works potatoes and a choice of toast or banana nut muffin.\"  He has his two eggs over easy with sourdough bread.  The country gravy was definitely creamy, but needed a bit more zip.\n\nI wanted a side of corn beef hash, and the waitress said they could definitely do that.  She asked if I wanted the homemade version or the canned, which I had never been asked before.  Apparently they just started doing the homemade version, but most people prefer the canned one instead.  Feeling the need to experiment, I went with the homemade version, knowing ahead that it was going to be more stringy-like.  And she also asked if I wanted it more well-done, which I took as \"crispier.\"  They also serve it as a small or large side order.  The homemade version is definitely a bit more stringier and something I've had quite often since most Filipinos eat their corned beef like that.  However, it definitely needed a bit more flavor - some heat and pepper took care of that!\n\nOverall, our breakfast experience this time was okay.

We were both pleasantly surprised with the food quality as well, especially for the price.  After finishing our meal, which was a fair amount, we were offered dessert.

Unfortunately, places like that are far and few between, and nearly impossible if you don't have the space or business.\n\nThe folks, the Husband, and I headed to Kan's Kitchen to check out their cheap eats menu of $1.80 for most of their items on the dim sum list. \n\nWith a handful of customers on a weekday, they asked if we were there for dim sum.  They then provided us with their dim sum menu and their secret menu of things listed only in Chinese.  (Now, many small mom and pop restaurants have this secret menu - sometimes they are posted on the wall and other times they are printed out.  They are only a 'secret' if you can't read Chinese, which is the case with me.  However, my dad can read it just fine and my mom has no shame in asking the wait staff to translate the menu for her...except that sometimes they can only translate it back in Chinese since they don't really know the English translation.  At that point, you need to understand Chinese or you're SOL.)\n\nAnyhow, getting back to the dim sum, we marked off what we wanted and sent it to the kitchen.  My mom immediately requested that they bring the food at a slower pace and not all at once.  All at once is good if you have a large party, not so good with a party of four.  You want the food to still be hot, otherwise you're stuck with dim sum that cools down as we rush to eat them.\n\nThese were among the things we ordered:\n\n* Shrimp Har Gow ($1.80)\n* Steamed Pork Shumai ($1.80)\n* Steamed Beef Ball ($1.80)\n* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce ($1.80)\n* Pork Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce ($1.80)\n* Duck Feet Roll ($1.80)\n* Fragrant Dumpling ($1.80)\n* Tofu Skin with Pork and Shrimp Roll ($1.80)\n* Plain Rice Noodle Roll ($1.80)\n* Pan Fried Dumpling with Chive, Shrimp & Pork ($1.80)\n\nWe also ordered Beef Brisket with Rice Noodle Soup.  My parents though the dim sum was good, and we had to agree.  It's definitely not bad for less than $2/plate.  Sure, there could be some improvements, but it'll do if you want a quick dim sum fix on the cheap.\n\nService was good - they were good about refilling our teapot and cleared our plates in a timely manner.  The waiter didn't mind explaining the Chinese-only menu on the wall, which was a good thing since that's were all the good stuff was (lunch specials of beef brisket noodle soup or won ton mein for $4.95).  At least we now know a place that offers good Chinese food for a fraction of the price than other other Chinese restaurants in town.\n\nFor those looking for late night dim sum, it's also available after 10 pm too.  \n\n3.5 stars\n\nUpdate! (05.09.10)\n\nA recent lunch visit and just wanted to add a few things...\n\nInstead of going for their dim sum menu - we went for their lunch specials.  They gave me a bunch of menus all written in Chinese, which was useless.  And then gave a few to the Husband in English - which is what we ended up using.  \n\n* Beef Chow Mein, Hong Kong-style ($4.95) - Chunky pieces of beef and veggies were part of this dish.  A standard size for the lunch special price.\n\n* Chicken Vegetable Chow Fun ($4.95) - I tried to change this to Vegetable Chow Fun, but it wouldn't be part of the lunch special price.  The waitress went over my lunch choice with me multiple times because she didn't want to get it wrong.  I even said it to her in Cantonese, but she didn't understand me.  When the Chicken Chow Mein arrived, I had to send it back since it was supposed to be thick rice noodles - which the waitress made a point of emphasizing (and still got it wrong).  It was a standard size for the lunch special price.  And although it says vegetables, I do realize that sometimes it can only mean onions, green onions, and bean sprouts.\n\nDespite the initial confusion over what we ordered (and I did hear the waitress speaking Cantonese and Mandarin), the food was fine for what we paid.  Nothing special this time around.  \n\n3 stars.\n\nThey do have hot chili oil on the tables readily available.

He did ask the waiter if it came as a entree option, but was told only as an app.  So, as a result the Husband was eating off my salad.  \n\nOur friend ordered the Panaca, Corned Beef Reuben Sandwich \"100% lean and trimmed corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and your choice of stone ground mustard or 1000 island on grilled marble rye bread.\" for $8.99.  It came with fries, potato salad, coleslaw or chips.  Since he didn't know what the Death Valley chips were, the waiter offered to bring him a sample so he could try it first. (I thought that was pretty nice of the waiter to do that.)  And as a result, he chose the Death Valley chips.\n\nService was a lot better this time!  Not only did our waiter check on us often, but the waitress who initially got us our drinks was following up on us as well.  There was no need to even worry about getting our beverages refilled since they were on top of it!  They are also in the Entertainment Book, which gives you a 15% discount every time you dine there after you use the coupon.\n\n3.5 stars overall.\n\nValue priced apps M-F 3-5 pm\n2 for 1 happy hour M-F 4-7 pm\n\nThey also have a Steiner's Pub card where you earn points when dining there.\n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "lzl3cfgVEGMtezF8oRqXDA"}

It came with a side salad, rice pilaf, and pita bread.  There were four pieces of meat skewered along with a side of tzatziki sauce.  First off, I think I was expecting something else.  I was expecting more of a souvlaki wrap, as this is how I used to have it.  So that part was different for me.  It was okay, nothing spectacular though.  (I soon learned that most souvlakis served here are with pita bread, and not wraps.  So I'll have to keep my eyes out for that.)\n\nThe Husband ordered the Moussaka \"Ground beef, eggplant, and potatoes layered and topped with Bechamel sauce\" ($8.99)  It did sound a lot more appetizing and once I read it off the menu, he was easily sold.  It was okay and he said he's had better.\n\nWe also downed it with a Greek soda - blue raspberry.\n\nOverall, Yassou Greek Grill Cafe was a decent Greek food experience.

After visiting two other sushi restaurants only to discover they were only doing a la carte, the BF and I decided to try out Sushi Hana.  \n\nWith its tinted front doors, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you open up.  Inside can appear daunting with his mint ice cream color paint and minimal decorations.  Upon entering, the sushi bar is laid out in front of you and to the left, while tables and chairs make up the right of the restaurant.  \n\nDinner buffet is $25.50/pp, while lunch is $19.95/pp.  Standard rules apply with no sharing among non-buffet eaters, no leftover rice, etc.  They limit you on your orders of Amaebi, Uni, and Toro, which most sushi buffets restaurants tend to do.  (It's a smart choice actually because we can easily eat a few hundred dollars worth of amaebi, uni, and toro.)  \n\nThe toro nigiri was so succulent!  It wasn't a grand piece in terms of size, but it was definitely good!  What a fabulous way to start our meal.  We were even surprised with our uni order, noting there was a bit more uni than we usually see at other restaurants.  The amaebi is standard, but I do love that sweet shrimp.  Don't forget to ask for the heads deep-fried too!  (Who doesn't love a little head?!)\n\nAmong the appetizer menu, we ordered some Agedashi Tofu, Soft-Shell Crab, and Seafood Poke.  The tofu came with four pieces and was lightly deep fried and how I like it.  The BF noted a strong ginger taste though, which I didn't seem to notice.  The crab came out in three pieces and was good too.  The BF was pleased that this restaurant offered it as an appetizer as other sushi buffets only offer it as a Spider Roll.  The poke was more like a seafood poke salad with the lettuce greens thrown in.  I could have passed on the salad greens, but I guess it kinda helps fill you up to.\n\nWe noticed on the \"Specials\" board a Kobe nigiri, which was also limited to one order per buffet diner.  Of course we had to get it.  It's a tender cut of beef that's rare.  The BF ate his all up and part of mine!  We also had Ikura, Hamachi nigiri, Hirame nigiri, and Negitoro.  The ikura and hamachi were standard, as well as the hirame.  (Hirame is just extraordinary in Peru for some odd reason, I can't quite find the same quality here!)  The negitoro came as a suggestion from the sushi chef, and it was a yummy piece.  We decided to pass on the rolls today, except for the lone Salmon Skin Roll the BF had to order.  It was generous roll with plenty of skin in it.  They also offered tempura, teriyaki, and other hot dishes.\n\nService was good, we didn't have to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  They actually came with a new glass of soda before the BF could finish his first, and he definitely appreciates this.  My water glass was filled too!  Dishes were cleared at a steady pace, often without me noticing.  \n\nIt was also nice to note that our sushi chef was Japanese as well as some of the waitresses.  Believe it or not, hearing dialogue in Japanese does give some creditability to the restaurant still.  \n\nAs our bellies got rounder, we decided to call for our check.  The waitress asked if we wanted any dessert, and we asked if it was included in the buffet and it was!  Yay!  (We had sadly noticed no dessert listed, so assumed there wasn't any.)  They had green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream, lychee sorbet, and plum sorbet.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with our experience there.  Sure, they don't have a ridiculously huge menu with a million rolls, but we were happy with the quality of sushi we got, and that's what mattered.\n\nThey are open late - until 2 am! \n\nThey also offer a frequent eater card - with ten visits, get one free!", "type": "review", "business_id": "jWfW-0nYJsyalTHDz0jrUQ"}

My last few attempts at Hawaiian food in Sin City haven't been the most favorable, so I was in doubt.  I shouldn't have been when it's coming from L & L, after all, they have an award winning \"Best Plate Lunch\", \"Hawaii's #1 Barbecue\", \"Best Chicken Katsu\", and \"Best Local Food\", and there's a reason they continue opening up more of these chain restaurants.\n\nThe BF was craving Hawaiian and it was getting closer to 10 pm on a Sunday night.  His only hope was for L & L, as we weren't interested in heading to Aloha Specialties.  We were told that our order was for to go only since it was so late, but we were fine with that.\n\nSearching for my pork lau lau (because that's what I always get), I quickly learned I could only get this order a la carte or with the Kahlua & Lau Lau Combo ($8.50 for regular which includes two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad).  So, a la carte, it costs $3.95.  I added a scoop of rice (60 cents) and a scoop of mac salad (89 cents).    The BF created a combo of his own with Chicken Katsu and the Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs.  With any regular order, you get a free soda fountain drink too.\n\nMy pork lau lau and scoop of rice was shoved into a little box.  It looked disappointing at first.  As I unraveled the ti leaves and revealed my succulent pork and taro leaves, it actually was a heartier portion than I had in mind.  I took a bite and was pleasantly surprised.  It was rather moist and not dry at all, as with many Hawaiian restaurants.  There were nice chunks of pork and its fatty goodness in this dish.  My only complaint was that it wasn't hot enough.  Even the BF was impressed too.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Katsu as well.  The batter was light and crispy and had a lot of taste.  I found myself reaching over to the BF's plate a lot as I enjoyed his dinner.  The Short Ribs were damn good too.  \n\nEven the mac salad struck a nice chord with me!  It wasn't overly mayonnaisy or too tangy, it was just right!  And the rice wasn't overly sticky or mashy as I've encountered before.  All in all, everything fit so well together in terms of what we ate.\n\nCounter service was okay.  The girl was on her cell phone when we walked in, so that's always tacky.  \n\nOverall, I was very impressed with L & L on South Maryland Parkway!  If I'm craving pork lau lau, chicken katsu, or beef short ribs, you'll find me at this Hawaiian joint!\n\nUpdate! 03/06/08 - I have since realized that this review was meant for the L & L Hawaiian Barbecue located at Mission Center, 4030 S. Maryland Parkway.  However, Yelp HQ can't move this review w/o having me delete it and repost it.  Oh well.

The free opera on the lake had us more intrigued, but the live music had us make a return after the opera performance.  This place was popping, mostly because a wedding party was celebrating their after party there.  \n\nThe band playing was giving up some pretty cool tunes, and we soon found out why.  They were were Acoustic Soul, \"...the first, fully live, by-request acoustic rock band in Vegas\" as noted on their myspace page.  And they were pretty good.

They were good and everyone was loving them.\n\nWe can't say too much about The Auld Dubliner except that they offer outdoor seating, which can be great on certain nights.

However, you need to turn into the parking lot before you drive past the club, otherwise you're stuck and have to make you u-turn somewhere.  \n\nA few people hanging out when we arrived on a Friday evening for dinner.  We chose a table by the right side and noticed how much more lighting there was at this restaurant (as opposed to the other two we've been to).  There was this annoying blue light though directly across from me, it was just a tad too neon.\n\nWe have our favorites and so this is what we ordered: \n\n* Vegetarian Combination \"A combination of alicha, collared greens and lentils.\" ($9.90) - I was concerned that there would be only three items in this combo, but  not so!  They had split lentils in red sauce (good, but a bit different from what we've had), green salad, carrots and string beans, steamed cabbage and potatoes, yellow bean thing (that we really liked here, better than the other places), beets and potatoes, yogurt, and collared greens.  So, there was definitely a nice array of things to choose from.\n\n* Kitfo \"Finely chopped, USDA choice lean beef with spiced butter and mitmita - hot pepper.\" ($8.90) - When we ordered this dish, we made a point of checking with the waitress to be sure it was going to be raw beef.  And we went over it a couple of times and she assured us it was raw.  I still had my doubts because I don't think she understood us.  Well, when the dish arrived, our kitfo looked like cooked ground beef.  The Husband and I asked the waitress again if this was the kitfo, the RAW beef, and she said it was!  I was in disbelief and knew my eyes were not fooling me.  Finally, another waitress came over and asked us if we wanted the raw beef, and we said yes.  So they took it back and changed out the beef.  It didn't seem to be a problem for them, I just don't think the waitress understood us at all.  The kitfo was good, not quite as spicy or buttery as Merkato's version, but still good.\n\nIt was the perfect amount of food for two people.\n\nService was fine - the waitress refilled our glasses without asking and brought out more injera (spongy flat sourdough bread) just as she saw we were needing it.  A few other people came in to dine during our visit there.  One gentleman asked if I wanted to join his party for coffee, but I passed.  (I think he was trying to pick me up despite the fact that I was with the Husband!)     \n\n3.5 stars\n\nCash only.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hb50dlqzhJ5WjkD2nwsqRQ"}

Pastrami \"Our famous Pastrami, mustard & pickles on a steak roll.\" (Large $8.99)  This is one super large sandwich and really should not be consumed by just one person.  They steamed the pastrami before giving it to us and therefore, the bread was a bit soggy from all the pastrami sitting on it.  It sat open faced and really is a crazy thing to get into your mouth.  The Husband really enjoyed the thin slices of beef, whereas I prefer the thicker grizzlier slices served elsewhere.  I also prefer my bread more on the crustier end than the soft side.\n\nWe also shared their signature fries - Garlic Romano (Med. $3.99).  We really enjoyed their fries, and I would be willing to drive there just for the fries.  They are thin, so much crispier based on the outer to inner ratio.

Although I do note this in the reservation, it's rarely and sometimes noticed and acknowledged.  In this case, the booth had two settings specifically set up side by side.

So tasty that we didn't even bother with our respective signature sauces that came with it.  Rather, we didn't even care for the sauces at all.  The meat was flavorful all on its own and that's what you call a good piece of beef!  Of course, half the fun is experimenting with their three salts and seeing which one goes best with your dish.\n\nThe garlic mashed potatoes were also good, and the roasted seasonal vegetables also had a good mix of veggies which surprised us.  Different kinds of squash, beets, and mushrooms were part of it.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food.

After experiencing the crawfish craze in the Westminster area of Southern California, imagine my delight when I saw the sign for \"Hot N Juicy Crawfish\" in Las Vegas.\n\nThe BF and I anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in Sin City and finally got to sit down to dinner the past Sunday.  Inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nWe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, and Hot n Juicy Combo.  At $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than SoCal prices but we were okay with it.  For every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  So, we made sure we got our corn pieces and potatoes and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (In the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  We also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  Depending on the season, they should be offering Dungeness crab, Blue crab, and shrimp.  You can also order oysters, fried shrimp or oyster baskets, Catfish Po-Boy Sandwich, or a Basket of fries.\n\nThey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  The heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  Of the four, I would say the Juicy Cajun had the least flavor while the Hot n Juicy Combo had the most.  We ordered four more pounds of the Hot n Juicy Combo in this sitting.  The sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  We also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  We're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  And I gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  They do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places I've experienced.\n\nBe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  You get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  This is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but I found myself not needing it that much.\n\nService was better too.  Upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  They also provide bibs too.  You can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  They asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (I would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, I only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nThey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  It didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nIn conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  It looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  Yay!\n\nSide note: There's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\n(You can check out my food photos up above!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "YrIfgzLj0DPStJ1ESAS_Qg"}

Started off with the back legs and moved up to the claws.  The meat was sweet and the crab was fresh.  Deciding on how to move about the body, broke the head off and it was crab head heaven.  Loads and loads of crab fat/head etc. and so bad for our cholesterol!  But it was so good, really good.  We were scooping that stuff up and dipping it into the sauce.  Yum yum! \n\nFinally moving onto the body, broke it in half and dug into the lump meat.  Really sweet meat and just good stuff.  Nice treat from having only crawfish.  They did a last call as we were chowing on the crab, which was fine for us at the time.\n\nCome to today, a few hours earlier, the Husband looks at me and says \"I want to go back for more crawfish.\"  I realize that because we ordered only two pounds the other day, we just teased ourselves.  (We're used to two pounds each.)  Then my brother calls and asks for the address of this place.  Is he in town...no, this weekend he will be with his boys.  Uh, if you're gonna go, we'll probably want to go with you too so let us know...\n\nYeah, we like it that much.  Our cholesterol numbers aren't looking too good at this point.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YrIfgzLj0DPStJ1ESAS_Qg"}

Our dishes also has a small side salad with our lunch dish too.\n\n* Pad Thai with Tofu Lunch Special \" Thai national noodle dish: rice noodles stir fried with bean sprouts, green onions, crushed peanuts and egg.\" ($6.95) - The MIL got this and per the Husband, he said hers was pretty good.\n\n* Red Curry Dish with Tofu Lunch Special \" Fresh red curry paste in coconut milk with bamboo shoot, zucchini and basil leaves.\" ($6.95) - Rich in color and taste, I ate it all up and it was good.  Yum.\n\n* Spicy Basil Dish with Ground Beef Lunch Special \" Sauteed with house special sauce, bell pepper, onion, zucchini and chili sauce.\" ($6.95) - The Husband said he forgot they were going to use ground meat, so he wished he got it with ground pork instead.  Nonetheless, he ate it all up, so I don't think there were any problems there.\n\nIn terms of lunch deals, they really make it all inclusive with the little extras they throw in.  However, portion size varies as our size of Pad Thai was only okay compared to another Thai place I went to recently that gave a huge lunch portion.  However, you can't beat the nicer ambiance at this branch.

There's even a mini duel right at the beginning to give you a visual of what's about to happen.\n\nThat evening, they played against the Arizona Roller Derby Tent City Terrors.  Sure, we lost but it was a very exciting game and you never really knew who was going to win!\n\nAdvanced tickets are $7 (although we tried purchasing such tickets the night before, but no luck), and $10 at the door.  Kids under 10 and EMTs are free!  This is definitely an athletic and family-friendly event, although a few of the players' names may be a bit suggestive.\n\nIt looks like they have two local teams - The Notorious VIPs and the Tommy Gun Terrors.

Their tuna salad has crunchy bits of celery and was to my liking.  French fries also came with my order.\n\nThe Husband saw their Specials board, which meant he was getting the Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich ($8.75).

(Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)\n\n* Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad \"Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing.\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.\n\n* Roasted Duck Noodle Soup \"Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth.\" ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.\n\n* Pad See-eu \"Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.\" ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.\n\n* Red Curry \"Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice.\" ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.

I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.\n\nService - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.\n\n3.5 stars\n\n(I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.

At that point, she asked if we wouldn't mind a booth and showed us to a lovely booth in the Swan's Court overlooking the swan pond.  This was actually nicer than sitting in the main dining room.\n\nWe knew we wanted to do one of their prix fixe menus, and they had two on this particular evening.  We decided on the Parallel Tasting Menu ($85 per person).  We didn't realize that this meant we would both get everything on the menu, which we actually found to our benefit.\n\nFirst Course:\n* Dungeness Crab and Ahi Tuna Mille Feuille, Coconut Kefir Lime Froth - Just as the waiter was about to present this to us, he realized that perhaps I could not eat the ahi tuna since I was preggos.  He immediately whisked it back to the kitchen and said he would take care of it.  We thought that was really sweet that he even remembered!  When it did arrive, only the Husband got it on his plate and I did not.  Nicely presented with a pretty foam, he wasn't as impressed with it as the crab cakes. \n* Seared Dungeness Crab Cake, Papaya Salsa, Yuzu Aioli - The Husband received only one of these while I received three (since I didn't get the crab and tuna mille feuille).  I thought it was so good, especially with the aioli.  The salsa added a nice sweetness and it was just licking it all up!\n\nSecond Course:\n*Olive Oil Poached Wild King Salmon, Citrus Braised Fennel, Sambal Buerre Blanc - I'm not the biggest fan of cooked fish, but the poached salmon was okay although not extraordinary.\n* House made Salmon Angelotti, Wilted Pea Tendrils, Olive Tomato Emulsion - The agnolotti pasta was a bit tough and doughy, and looked more like bone marrow covered in red sauce when it was presented.\n\nThird Course:\n* Japanese Pepper, Wagyu Beef Strip Loin, Grilled Abalone Mushroom, Sweet Potatoes Fries - My biggest fault in ordering this dish was having it medium well, which isn't exactly how I would usually have my beef (rare, please).  I think this played a factor as to why my meat was tough and not as enjoyable as it could have been.\n* Seared Diver Sea Scallop, Yukon Gold Morel Mushroom and Fava Beans, Potato Gnocchi - Who doesn't like a perfectly cooked diver sea scallop?  Yum yum yum.  And with mushrooms?  Even better! \n\nFourth Course: \n* Blueberry Meyer Lemon Financier \n* Lemon Mascarpone Semifreddo\n* Blueberry Lemon Verbena Sorbet\nAll the desserts, including the complimentary trio of sorbets, were just wonderful.  (I think the flavors were coconut, tangerine, and watermelon.)  We enjoyed every bit of our trio of desserts and could have kept on going.  They definitely do their sorbets very well here too.\n\nService was fabulous.  The waiter was attentive without being overbearing and our beverage glasses were refilled in almost a timely manner.  The one thing that isn't so great is the house photographer.  They offer to take your picture at the beginning of the meal and have you pose in certain ways too, and then show you various packages you can buy at the end.  It's pretty expensive for a few pictures and ultimately, you just don't want it.  It can put a damper on your evening when you just want to dine, and not worry about buying silly pictures.\n\nOverall, Aureole was a good experience.  It wasn't super fabulous and we weren't there to watch the Wine Fairies, but it was a good meal overall.  Of course, it helped that we had a restaurant.com coupon too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3w5gd4EuSc75UKYMJiNUPA"}

The host of the show, whose a comedian and magician, keeps the audience laughing and engaged in between acts.\n\nTerra Jole has all the moves and costumes of Britney Spears and Madonna, but it's her strong voice that carries through when she sings Alanis Morissette and Cher.  (The headset she wears for Britney and Madonna just doesn't carry her voice that well.)  I would have loved to hear more songs that really showed off her vocal talent.\n\nAlso performing were two brothers (not twins) that can dance like no other in their Michael Jackson and Milli Vanilli performances.  There were also two other performers, one playing the drums in the earlier set of the show and then another guy playing the role of Sonny later on.  However, I feel like I got the short end of the stick.  I thought there was going to be a mini-Tina Turner and a mini-Elvis Presley!  Was my 7 pm show an afterthought, so I didn't get the true full performance?\n\nNonetheless, the show is pretty entertaining and relies heavily and on audience participation.  With drinks being 2 for 1, it definitely helps when the audience is rowdy and engaging.  \n\nI hope that their full show does include Elvis and Tina.  Otherwise Terra can do the whole show herself with the guys working as backup dancers for her the whole time.    \n\nOverall rating: 3.5\n\nTry to catch this show on a busier night so the audience gets loud!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VNol2hxriDR5VCcNMWsG8A"}

Then because of Jeff P.'s recent visit and the free coupon we got in the mail, we decided to give it a go!\n\nThe BF had warned me that it was like Pinkberry's, which is the current rage is southern California.  He said it literally tastes like the kind of yogurt you buy from the store, so I should be warned.  It's a good thing he did tell me that.  (I had yet to experience Pinkberry's myself!)\n\nI've had my share of frozen yogurt from places like Golden Spoon.  To me, it's like ice cream that's smoother.  But as I said, it's LIKE ice cream...which is sweet.\n\nNot in this case, Cefiore serves up Italian non-fat frozen yogurt, and it's a different kind of frozen yogurt.  It's sour like regular yogurt and I was just not digging it!  They offered four flavors when I was there - original, green tea, raspberry pomegranate, and blackberry.\n\nThey sell their yogurt by the ounces, and they will weigh it out for you too.  Toppings are an additional 95 cents, which seems a bit costly for me.  But I guess they have to recoup their costs when their offering things like mochi, Capt. Crunch and Fruity Pebbles cereal, Oreo cookies, and fresh fruit chunks (mango, strawberries, raspberries, etc.).  \n\nYou can also have your frozen yogurt on shaved ice, aka Snow Ice, which is then topped with fresh fruits, sweet red bean, or green tea yogurt.  Or have it blended into a smoothie for people on the go!\n\nI guess they are expecting to do really well, they have 17 locations already, with two in Vegas alone.  And by the end of 2008, they expect to have an additional 30 more store open worldwide!  Ambitious, aren't they?\n\nThe girls working there are nice and will let you sample the flavors before you make your choice. I wish the one who had helped us offered a lid instead of sticking a couple of spoons in the yogurt.  We still had to drive home!

That's all I can really say.  My mistake was not reading all the other yelp reviews before trying this place, otherwise I would have just said no.\n\nLooks can be deceiving and this place is pretty busy with large parties taking over the tables.  Not only is there a regular menu, but if you look around, you'll see pictures with numbers posted on the wall.  Good luck trying to find out what they are because they are listed on the menu and there's no pricing.  When we asked a waitress about a particular picture on the wall, all she could really say about it was that it was fish.  (Uh, we could tell that it was fish, we wanted to know what kind of sauce or how it was cooked!)\n\nIn the beginning, the wait staff was on us to order but since we were taking so long, it's as if we were forgotten.  (How could they miss us with their bright yellow menus still in front of us?)\n\nAfter passing on their expensive pho ($6.99 to $7.99), I chose the Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam style chicken with seasoned rice) for $8.99.  Initially, I had seen an entr\u00e9e version of this dish and was going to inquire about it, but since I wanted the seasoned rice, I chose to go with this option.  The Big F is a big fan of Com Bo Kho (Beef stew with steamed rice) for $7.99, but usually sees it served with a French roll instead of rice.  \n\nAs we waited for our food to arrive, the wait staff at a nearby table was attracting my attention.  Although I couldn't hear what they were saying, their actions were speaking louder than their words.  They were talking about clearing a table and apparently the previous diners left their barely touched strawberry shake on the table.  I'm not sure what the busboy did with that shake, but he sure didn't toss it into the garbage right away like he should have.  What really bothered us was the plate of pho garnishes that were returned to the kitchen for further use.  (How do I know he did that?  Well, he had a cleaning cart with a garbage can attached to it and he dumped all the other garbage in there.  But he made a point of taking that plate of garnishes and bringing it back to the kitchen.  That looks suspicious to me.)\n\nWhen my plate of Hainamese chicken arrived, it looked awful.  (Check the photos out for yourself!)  First off, it looked like leftover chicken all thrown on a plate and covered with scallions, ginger, and cilantro so I couldn't see the banged up chicken underneath.  And there was no skin left on my chicken!  Part of the dish is the tasty skin, and it looked like they gave me the healthy version!  Once I got past how little chicken I got, I noticed something else was wrong.  Uh, where is my seasoned rice?  There's a huge ball of white steamed rice on my plate and the seasoned rice is half the dish!  When I asked the waiter about it, he said they ran out of the seasoned rice.  When I explained that was why I ordered the dish, he went to the back to the kitchen.  He came back reaffirming that they did indeed run out of seasoned rice and he would give me a discount on the dish.  I was hungry, so I ate what I had in front of me.  It was far from special.\n\nThe Big F's beef stew was just okay, and he's had a lot of the stew in other places.  He was initially turned off because it didn't have the same color that he was used to.  He pointed out that there was a lot of MSG in it too.  I also saw him pour soy sauce in it, so I knew that it was not hitting his taste buds.\n\nWhen we went up to pay, I noticed they didn't give me any discount.  I had to ask the waiter about it, and he took $2 off the total bill.  (At least he did that!)\n\nIn the end, bad food with average service and suspicious kitchen practices.  Although they offered a few unique family dinner options, you won't see us walking through these doors again any time soon.  Keep on driving, there are plenty of other better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain.\n\nCash only.\n\nUpdate: After posting this review, someone contacted me saying their wife worked here part-time.  He mentioned that they do not resell the smoothies, but they do reuse the pho condiments since they are a bit expensive.  The last I checked, bean sprouts and limes were not expensive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gCo--CY5aUoByxUAET2cTw"}

If your dining companions aren't into cooking their meal themselves, then this place won't work for them.  However, they can always stuff themselves on the appetizers like cod fish, salads, and beef misoyaki\n\nAll entrees come with a green salad, rice, selected veggies, tofu, noodles, and three dipping sauces.\n\nThe Big F went for the King #18 ( 1/2 Beef,  1/2 Shrimp, and  1/2 Scallop) for $25 and I went for the Jack #1 (Original Beef) for $18.\n\nAs the water, lightly seasoned with seaweed, heats up, a small green salad with yummy dressing starts you off.  Feel free to ask for more because they are more than happy to give it to you!\n\nThen your table gets set up with your rice, various raw veggies and food, and your three dipping sauce.  The first being a peanut sauce, then a ponzu one, and then a spicy ponzu-like one.\n\nThe pot is split so you don't have to worry about your dining companion stealing your food! When the water starts to boil, start adding the food.  I don't recommend adding all the food at once, but rather a little bit at a time.  I like to swish my beef around just to cook it a tad before dipping it into the various sauces.\n\nThe beef and shrimp were great choices, but the scallops got rubbery too quickly.  (Reading Steve X.'s review, I wish were given soy sauce and wasabi so we could have eaten the scallops raw as well.  Bummer!  At least we know for next time!)\n\nWhat makes Shabu Shabu Paradise a step up above Swish is that they also give you additional veggies without charging for it!  It seems a bit ridiculous to be charged for what is considered inexpensive veggies when you're cooking it yourself!  \n\nAnd to close it off, complimentary ice cream with fruit cocktail is offered!\n\nService is great - the waitresses are really sweet and friendly about bringing you additional things as requested or when they see you need it.  It can get a bit hectic when the restaurant fills up as it started to on the Saturday evening we went.\n\nThey have about three tables for four and one long table that seats about 10-12.

It's not the kind of sukiyaki where the plate is sizzling and the sauce is thick, rather it's the flavoring of the broth is now different.\n\nThe Husband ordered the Queen Half Pork and Half Beef Dinner, (You can easily substitute the meats for each other, chicken for pork or beef, etc.)  while I had the Jack Scallop Dinner.  When my plate arrived, we were both very surprised with how much scallop came out.  Laid out ever so nicely, the quality grade is definitely sashimi-style.  (After reading about Steve X.'s experience, I was certain to ask for some wasabi and soy sauce so I could it raw.)\n\nAs Calvin L. mentioned, the noodles given to you are tofu noodles and they are SO good!

Sometimes it can get a bit busy and you have to wait awhile longer, but the staff are so nice and friendly.

(Specifically, the evening waitress since we see her the most.)\n\nThis year, I haven't been able to indulge in their raw scallops, so we've been ordering their beef only.  (Pretty soon though, I'll be back on the raw scallop diet!  Yes, you can eat their scallops raw - ask for some soy sauce and wasabi.)  Sometimes I'll pick the mushroom option for a little change though.\n\nThey also have raw garlic paste which is nice to add to your ponzu sauce, be sure not to add it to your broth because it'll boil over and make a mess! \n\nWe love their salad and dressing - no iceberg lettuce here!  And we love the free refills on that!\n\nWe love their veggies and of course, can't get enough of their tofu noodles.  Yes, free refills on all of that too!\n\nMost recently, we did the whole split plate charge (courtesy of reading Bobby Y.'s review).  It says there on the menu that they'll charge you $6 for a split plate and here, it's so worth it!  We ordered one item from the Jack menu and paid the additional six.  This worked out well since I wasn't eating that much beef and the Husband could have it all to himself for the most part.  Meanwhile, I still get my fill on the salad, rice, veggies, tofu noodles, and dessert too!  Not a bad way to spend $6 in my opinion!\n\nAnd you can't help but love that they give coupons out every time you visit - it's hard getting there within the next 20 days though.

The Husband and I tried once before to check out this 'authentic' Chinese restaurant hidden away in the Spring Mountain area but arrived when it was closed.\n\nWe were on a mission and had a (small) crowd with us.  Taking no reservations, the five of us arrived around 6:30 pm on a Friday night.  With plenty of tables available, the waitress seemed conflicted as to where to put us.  In the end, a round table in the middle was where we ended up.\n\nOur menu: \n  \n* Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - Arriving in a large bowl, pretty tasty stuff that you need lots of white rice to eat with.  Lots of spice and oil, but pretty good and is amongst their specialties.\n\n* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) - Soft tofu with lots of flavor and gravy.  Another good choice!\n\n* Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($7.85) - Really good as well, although not the favorite of the bunch.  \n\n* Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) - At least that's what I think we ordered...it arrived with a fire going on beneath it.  Others really enjoyed it, but it was okay to me.\n\n* A pork or chicken dish with green bell peppers - It was a good dish, without the gravy.  It had hidden heat amongst the green bell peppers because green chilies were hiding in the dish.\n\nI had low expectations on service, and you really don't come here for service.  No one spoke or understood any English, which was a major problem.  Only Mandarin speaking only!  We thought they forgot about a dish because it took so long, and we think they really did.  It eventually came out at the end.\n\nOur second visit was a party of five again and this was our menu:\n\n* Boiled Fish and Beef in Szechuan Special Sauce ($10.25) - Any of their \"boiled\" things in Szechuan special sauce is a good choice.\n\n* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) \n\n* Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) \n\n* Potato ($7.85) - The Husband saw a lot of people ordering this on our first visit, so we had to get it.  It's potato that's been stir-fried without the spice.  It's a light dish and we liked it so much that it inspired us to make it at home.  (It comes out different at home, more like Chinese-style hash browns when I do it!)\n\n* Sauteed (Garlic Sauce) Seasonal Vegetable ($7.85) - The vegetable was snow pea shoots which are always good when cooked with garlic.\n\n* Pork Intestines - Stir-fried with lots of veggies.  It was good, but we just ordered too much food this time around.\n\nService was better the second time around, only because there was one waitress who spoke and understand English very well, AND she spoke Cantonese, which helped since my mom was there.  But everyone else who worked there just looked at us as if we were aliens whenever we tried to ask about anything.  I also had some problems getting my credit card receipt.  They gave me one to sign, but nothing to keep.  When I asked for it, it was a big deal to get a copy and I think it's because they really didn't understand that I just wanted my credit card receipt.\n\nGo with a large group so you can try more things.  One dish for every person should be an ample amount.  The food is pretty authentic and there's a definite heat in it.  Most diners are native Chinese and this place definitely fills up by 7:30 pm.  Just don't have any expectations with service or anyone speaking English.\n\n3.5 for really tasty and authentic Chinese food but negatives for crap service.\n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "HZjLErXWi1vZWMgsAjBEeQ"}

It's always been a winner, so why not go for it again.\n\n* Bean Curd Fish with Szechuan Special Spicy Sauce ($9.25) - We asked for a recommendation for fish, and the waiter suggested this one.  It has a very similar sauce as the beef dish, but it also has peanuts in it too.  Loads of spice again!\n\n* Home Style Potato ($7.85) - We wanted a potato dish and thought it was the same one we've ordered before where the potatoes are cut into strips and stir-fried.  This dish is different since the potatoes are sliced and boiled, it sits in a chicken broth with jalapenos.  It was good, especially against all the heat from the other dishes, but we wished we had gotten the other potato dish instead.\n\nWhen you eat at Yun Nan Garden, you have to be prepared for the heat.

It's good enough for about four people to have a small bowl each.  The waiter will come with a big bowl of about four to five rectangular pieces of rice crust.

(There's a Chinese version called sizzling rice soup, except that soup is more broth-like and the rice may not be in rectangles.)\n\nWe didn't get any kind of bowl to grind our own sesame seeds like lena d. or Mike C., so maybe that's only if you order the katsu, which we didn't.  And we also came for dinner which I think is a different experience too.\n\nI'd definitely want to return to try out their other Korean goodies, but I would prefer going with a larger group so you can order more stuff.  Their portions are meant to share, so it's hard when it's only the two of you.\n\nThe artwork in the bathrooms makes for interesting conversation (especially the men's room) and there's also a Luxury Music Studio in the back.  (Is that for karaoke?)  \n\nThere's also a little bell to buzz from your table should you need the staff, that way you don't have to wave them down or go looking for them yourself.\n\nThen swing by next door to Dessert Avenue to have some Fried Ice!  Yum!\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MfQWzjADewehBJaK4oGj3g"}

But when you're living in Vegas, the only way to go is to do AYCE, right?  After getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.\n\nAll-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.\n\nLike Ned M. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  Perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.\n\nWe ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  As one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  Maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  I'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.  \n\nThey do offer a wider selection of side items like Asian style skirt steak, ribeye steak teriyaki, etc.  And for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other AYCE places.  I do like their version of agadashi tofu though.\n\nLimitations on their menu include:\n* one order of uni and amaebi per person\n* limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person\n* limit one order on desserts of creme brulee, mochi ice cream, berry parfait or green tea tiramisu (regular ice cream is AYCE though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)\n\nSitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  The manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  We thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  He continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  There was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.\n\nI can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  The staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  They have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  Overall, we found Oyshi Sushi to be an average place for AYCE sushi.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lPh02W25cOrAz57UbTpbFQ"}

(Lunch is $20.99/pp.)  \n\nWhen you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.\n\nAfter being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.  \n\nAppetizers: \n* Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty!\n* Ahi Poki - Pretty good!\n* Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff!\n* Edamame\n* Garlic Chicken\n* Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person)\n* Pork Gyoza\n* Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person)\n* Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)\n\nNigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing.

So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.\n\nI wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.\n\nThey are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.   \n\nYou are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.\n\nService was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.\n\nThey also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.\n\nWhat makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.

When we separated them, we realized they were still frozen!  Yikes!  I waved the waitress down and showed her the fish.  She apologized and took it away immediately.  A new order came out later on, with a new piece of fish and the previous one refried.  \n\nWhen the bill arrived, the fish and chips were automatically taken off without us saying anything.  \n\nAlthough there is a separate dining area from the bar, there's not much that keeps the smoke from entering the eating area.

Not only is it a place that talks about desert landscaping, but there are plenty of galleries and exhibits that reflect the natural history of this town.

There's a cute gift shop that was worth checking out (and apparently is under going reconstruction since our last visit), and the Wolfgang Puck Cafe on site.\n\nOne thing that's confusing is that it's actually free to visit the trails and gardens, but there is a charge for the exhibits and galleries.  You still need to go to the ticket window to get a pass to let you in, but you just have to tell them you want to visit only the garden and trails and it's free.  The first time I went, I noticed a lot of visitors confused about this and ending up paying for what they thought and hoped was going to be a free visit.\n\nPrices can be a bit steep though, in my opinion.  But currently they are running a promotion for January where adults can get in for the price of a child.  I think there's also discounts for locals too.  Memberships are probably the best value since they offer discounted tickets to special events.\n\nSpecial events are probably the best thing about Springs Preserve - some are free, and some aren't.

I was skeptical since I was in sneakers and didn't want to pay a cover just to check it out.  I guess it was slow that Saturday night because we walked right on in.  (I think they usually have a dress code and probably charge.)  Walking to the back, you'll pass the bar with go-go dancers shaking their thing behind the bar.  The dance floor is along the back, along with some sectioned off areas.  \n\nIf you walk to the front that faces Fremont Street, you'll see an open air patio that provides a nice relief when it gets too hot in there.

They need more TVs or projectors so everyone can see these videos make an appearance.\n\nAnd yes, the clientele is definitely 'different,' I would say they are the downtown-type.  This can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you're expecting.  For that night, it worked and provided us an entertaining evening.  I had plenty of room to dance my butt off  without bumping into people left and right.  Everyone was super-friendly and was just there to have a good time, not the pretentious type at all.  Our guy friend was dancing his butt off and he was giving such a good show that everyone wanted to dance with him!

We arrived shortly after 6 pm on a weekday and grabbed a coveted table outside on the patio.  \n\nAll their specialty martinis and wines are half-priced, as well as everything on the menu!  (Desserts included!)  What a steal!\n\nThe BF ordered the Down & Dirty (Ketel One Vodka and Olive Juice served with Three Large Olives) and I had the Bellini (Ketel One Vodka, Peach Schnapps, House Champagne, and a splash of Orange juice).  They bring the shaker to you and pour it tableside, which I think is great.  Not only does the waitress not have to worry about balancing the delicate martini glass, but you don't have to worry about trying to drink from a very full glass.  They average about to $7-$8 each during HH.\n\nWe started off with the St. Louis Style Spinach & Artichoke Dip (Spinach & Artichokes Mixed with a St. Louis Provel Cheese Sauce, Topped with Parmesan and Served Hot with Toasted Pita Triangles).  Like Mr N. mentioned, the pita chips are rock hard.  I'm not sure if they are intentionally supposed to be this hard, but they could soften them up a bit!  A pretty decent order for the price you're paying and pretty good too.\n\nI had the Chicken Quattro Formaggi (8oz. Lightly Breaded Seasoned Chicken Breast Stuffed with Four Cheeses (Asiago, Parmesan, Mozzarella, & Provolone) served with Seasoned Rice, Marinated Artichoke Hearts Accompanied by a Roasted Red Pepper Sauce), which is odd since I don't usually like to order chicken breast.  I think the whole 'stuffed with four cheeses' got my attention and that's what sold me.  I had to ask for more sauce so the chicken had more flavor.  The accompanying artichoke hearts and greens lightened up the meal.  The BF enjoyed my dish.\n\nThe BF scored a winner with the Miniature Martini Lamb Chops (8oz. of Mint Marinated Rack of Lamb served with Seasoned Rice).  They were so moist and tasty, not gamey at all!  We had to ask for more of the green sauce because it tasted so good!  I wish I ordered this instead!  We'd definitely go back for this dish alone!\n\nIt's pretty chill hanging out there in the evenings.  It gets super packed though, so good luck trying to score a table if you come with a large party.  You can always grab seating inside, but it's pretty dark in there in my opinion.  And yes, there are a lot of fake tans, pretty boys in their shades and 'roids.  An amusing place to people watch if anything.\n\nI have to agree with Myke R. about the restrooms being way too far.  Coming from the patio, it's a trek to meander yourself around the tables and crowds just to pee and wash up.  (I did see Allison J. though on my way to the loo!)\n\nOverall, Blue Martini is a pretty cool place to hang out during happy hour.  I don't think I'd want to fight the crowds though during weekends and nights since this place fills up.  They do check ID, so no kiddies in here at all.  \n\nUpdate! 05/31/08 - Went back for HH on a Friday night and this place is PACKED!  \n\n* Seared Tuna (Sushi grade ahi tuna resting on a nest of asian seaweed and calamari salad, served with asian sesame dressing and wasabi.)  I'm not a big fan of seared tuna, but the seaweed, ginger, and calamari combo definitely added a nice contrast.\n\n* Bruschetta (Fresh Diced Roma Tomatoes Marinated with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic and Basil Served on Toasted Sliced Bread Rounds Topped with Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese)  Nothing special, pretty basic that anyone could make at home.\n\nI also tried a couple of their flatbreads.  By the time I got to it, It had been sitting out for awhile, so they were not hot as they should be.  Probably tastes a lot better when you eat them right away.\n\n* Mango Madness (Finlandia Mango Vodka, Mango Schnapps, a splash of Pineapple juice) So so good!  A bunch of people from our group was drinking this and we all loved it!  A definite fave of the house, even for guys! \n\n(You can find pics of our happy hour experience in the business profile.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "84bLhe1aibxNmogtqSO4rA"}

After checking out Merkato, a waiter elsewhere mentioned this restaurant.\n\nIt was pretty empty on a Saturday night with only one party having dinner.  Two TVs in the corner with the sports channel on.  A few stragglers came in to dine and for to-go orders.  It's also pretty dark in this restaurant.\n\nWe knew we wanted something standard that we could compare our previous experience to, but we couldn't quite find these items on the menu.  We knew we wanted veggies and beef.  This is what we got:\n\n* Vegetarian Combo ($14) - Since the vegetarian items were sold a la carte, we asked if we could have a veggie combo, and they came up with one.  (I'm sure it exists, but we didn't see it on the menu.  It has six different items on it.  Our favorites were the split lentils - one in green sauce and the other in red - really tasty and we're just loving our lentils.  Then the yellow bean thing, the steamed cabbage and carrots , the collared greens, and the green salad.  Of course, it's all laid out on a piece of injera, the spongy  sourdough flatbread used to pick up your food with.  \n\n* #22. Raw Beef \"A beef served with chilies with injera.\" ($12) - We initially wanted to order #26. Kitifo Special \"Finely chopped lean beef with spiced Ethiopia butter, collard greens, homemade cottage cheese, mitmite (spiced hot chilies).\" ($11) but when the waitress asked us if we wanted it medium or well, we figured we ordered the wrong thing.  We wanted raw beef, so quickly chose #22.  The waitress was surprised that we wanted raw beef, but we were hoping that it would be similar to the raw beef we had at Merkato Ethiopian Restaurant.  Boy, were we wrong!  Out came five chunks of raw beef, and I do mean fist size pieces!  (Check the pics!)  We weren't sure if it was a joke, but the waitress placed it down before us with two knives and a bowl of hot chili paste.  The Husband just looked at me and gave it a go.  He attempted to slice off pieces of beef, but both knives were very dull and he was struggling.  It was a very sad attempt.  Even with the fork we requested, it didn't help much.  At one point I thought I could be a barbaric animal and pick up my piece of meat and give it a tear by the mouth.  Unfortunately, that didn't work either.  Eventually, we were able to finally cut through two chunks of the beef.  We ended up taking the rest home.  The meat was fresh, and the spicy chili sauce is really what makes this dish.  It was just something we definitely weren't expecting and a bit too much effort.  (When we packed the three chunks of beef home, we made sure to ask for more of that chili paste.)\n\nAt one point, we were certain another waitress could see us struggling but didn't really do anything about it.  We even asked the guy sitting at the bar if we were doing it right and he said we were doing fine.  (If only the knives were sharper!)  At the end of the meal, the guy at the bar said that most people start off with gored gored, which is cubed beef filet rolled in spices, similar to kitfo (which we know we like already).  So it was pretty impressive that we started with raw chunks of beef with no spices or marination.  \n\nService was okay. We wish the waitress told us it was chunks of solid beef because we probably would have ordered something else. She did come by with more injera before we had to ask.  But after we got our to go box, we waited awhile for our check and nothing came.  We had to remind her, although there were only a few people dining.\n\nOverall, the food is good, but the menu is limited.  It looks like the left side of the menu is for lunch, and the right side is for dinner.  In retrospect, we should have asked if we could have ordered from the left side because the dish we really wanted was on it! (# 7 Kitfo \"Finally chopped, lean beef with spiced Ethiopian butter, homemade cottage cheese, and mitmita (spiced hot chilies) and served with injera.\"  Or perhaps we could have ordered #26 with raw/rear beef, but the waitress assumed we wanted it medium or well, and that's why she asked?  Also, our bill didn't quite reflect what we ordered, so double check your bill when it comes. \n\n3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6Oh_zSwy3ec-ThAqHqGj9A"}

You get soup or salad to start, 10 oz. slice of prime rib, a baked potato, and string beans.

Located next to Ming's Table, the long line is easily misleading.\n\nThe 24 hour cafe serves up your standard fare.  They have a special breakfast menu from 6 am to 11 am, and then an all day menu.  Posters advertising their lunch specials for $7.77 are what brought us in yesterday morning.  (And I'm sure it brought many others in, as well.)  \n\nWhen we finally got seated, the breakfast menu was brought out and we asked about their lunch specials.  There were only three options to choose from and they looked far from special.  (I wish the waiter had offered the all day menu to peruse as well.)  There was a steak special that started at 2 pm, and our waiter was quick to tell us he didn't recommend it.  (We appreciated his honesty at least!)\n\nI ended up with the Corned Beef Hash breakfast ($10.99).  It comes with two eggs your way, hash browns, and choice of toast, bagel, or English muffin.  Yes, the corned beef hash was salty and basic.  I was a bit disappointed.\n\nMy aunt ordered the Bone-In Ham and Eggs Breakfast ($14.99) and it was a hearty chunk of ham.  She had leftovers.\n\nMy other aunt  ordered the Lox and Bagel ($10.99) and it was accompanied by an herb spread, capers, a hard-boiled egg, red onions, and tomato slices.  \n\nThe breakfasts took a little while to arrive, which was surprising when our neighbors got their food way before we did.  Our water glasses were rarely refilled, we actually helped ourselves to their makeshift water/OJ station right next to our table. \n\nWe didn't appreciate the extra $1.99 charge for salsa that appeared on our bill.  (Uh, don't they usually tell you when things cost extra?)\n\nOverall, it's expensive and not worth the price.

I even gave them a four stars that first time.  However, things have since changed...\n\nTheir regular pork lau lau order came with two scoops of rice, a scoop of mac salad and two pork lau laus for $8.50  There was nothing special about it this time.  It was rather dry and just not enough fatty goodness to make it good.  I actually had leftovers this time, and when it's good stuff...I eat it all!

Tapas.  With our intimate group of six, we got a chance to try a variety of their tapas.\n\nStarting off with two pitchers of their sangria, we chose:\n\n* R.E. Sangria ($24): \"Spanish Rioja, citrus fruits and juices, and a few other special ingredients.\" - Pretty typical of your red sangria, lots of ice though.  Pretty light on the alcohol though.\n\n* Peach Raspberry Sangria ($24): \"White Rioja, peach nectar, sliced peaches, fresh raspberries, and peach schnapps.\" - A lighter fare of sangria, enjoyed by the girls in our party than the guys.  Again, light on the alcohol.\n\nTapas we chose: \n\n* Empanadas ($5): \"Stuffed with seasoned ground beef, avocado cr\u00e8me fraiche.\" - A favorite amongst the group.  It was only one empanada cut into two pieces, so that was a bit disappointing.  Pretty simple when you think about it.\n\n* R.E. Corn Dogs ($6): \"House made chorizo sausage, honey cilantro-corn meal battered, chipotle mustard.\" - The Big F really enjoyed these corn dogs, the spiciness from the sausage and the mustard gave it the necessary bite to make it stand out from you average corn dog.  Came with three dogs.\n\n* Shrimp and Scallop Ceviche ($7):  \"Lightly poached scallops and shrimp, marinated with citrus red onion, peppers, and cilantro.\" - Uneventful, although nicely presented.  We requested some sort of bread or chips, and all they could provide were what they called 'pita chips.'  In actuality, it was just plain pita bread. \n\n* Albondigas ($6): \"House made, parmesan and fresh herb meatballs, baked in tomato cream sauce.\" - Three meatballs in a nice sauce.\n\n* Baked Brie ($8): \"Diced Spanish Chorizo, green onions, and fresh herbs, wrapped in puff pastry and baked golden.\" - I don't remember any chorizo in the brie.  I was too focused on requesting bread or crackers to put my brie on.  They were able to provide garlic bread, but it took awhile for it to come out.  It also came with a side of leafy greens.\n\n* Colorado Lamb Chops ($12): \"Marinated and grilled, served with agria dulce.\" - Came with two chops and two dipping sauces.  I didn't get a chance to taste it though.\n\n* Blackened Salmon Tacos ($7): \"Confetti-cabbage slaw and chipotle aioli.\" - Three soft tacos with more cabbage slaw than salmon.\n\n* Feta Fries ($7): \"Smothered with crumbled feta and spinach cream sauce.\" - The one thing that our whole group could easily share without having to cut things up.  Tasty stuff because who doesn't like melted cheese on fries?\n\n* Rolled Eggplant ($8): \"Three cheeses and herbs wrapped in pan fried eggplant, baked in red sauce.\" - Looked like lasagna, not easy to share or consume.\n\n* Mini-Herb Roasted Chicken ($9): \"Herb infused olive oil and cracked pepper.\" - The worst of the dishes.  Half a chicken that looked blah on the plate and tasted even more blah if that's possible. Do not order.\n\n* Lobster Ravioli ($7): \"Maine lobster, tarragon, brown butter and lemon.\" - Three raviolis that held promise.  The one I got was cold, so the skin was hard.  However, the person who ate the one in the middle liked hers.\n\nMoving onto dessert, the Big F wanted to try their Grilled Apricots ($6), but they were out!  In the end, we had these two:\n\n* Three Ganache Chocolate Terrine ($5.50): \"Fresh berries, cherry crackle.\" - Very cute presentation with a mix of flavors.\n\n* Caramel Flan ($6): \"Desiccated coconut, citrus plantain chip.\" - Recommended by our waitress, good overall.  Plantain chip could be done a lot better.\n\nFood-wise, we were a bit disappointed by the serving size.  Perhaps we're used to being able to share our tapas with a group of people.  I would think there'd be at least 3-4 servings in each tapa, not two.  It would have helped if the waitress told us how many pieces were in each dish as well, so we would know how many orders to get to suit our party. \n\nService-wise, we were not too impressed either.  Sure, the waitress was great about getting the candles on the dessert and surprising the birthday boy.  But she never cleared the dishes fast enough or at all.  By the time dessert shows up, you'd think all empty plates and pitchers would be cleared.  Not here unfortunately.  And as a result, our table was always so cluttered.  It was hard to find space for our dishes as they arrived, especially with the bigger than average-size plates.\n\nOverall, R.E. Tapas was an okay experience.  They were some hits, but more misses.  It wasn't too busy when we went on Saturday night, which is nice change from Firefly on Paradise.  However, they are still in its infancy so they can only get better.  Add more alcohol to the sangria!\n\n(Pics of our dining are posted)", "type": "review", "business_id": "vEXLYkNgmD922ClQ1YDXKQ"}

Located in the Pacific Asian Plaza on the 2nd floor in the corner, Dessert Avenue reminds me of a Hong Kong-style cafe with snacks for your sweet and savory teeth.\n\nWe've been meaning to try this place out for awhile, but with them closing at 2 am, it makes it a bit tricky.  We finally made it over tonight after dining next door at Bazic.  \n\nWe skipped over their savory items like fish balls, noodle soups, green onion pancakes, and rice dishes and went straight for the dessert menu.  \n\nThey have desserts that include bird nests, harsmar (go look up this one on the internet and you'll laugh your ass off!), sago, tofu custard, jelly, and fresh fruit juices.  It was their 'Fried Ice Series' that piqued our interest and one of the employees asks us if we have any questions.  We ask for an explanation of the fried ice and it definitely sounds pretty good.\n\nThe BF went for the Sago with Grapefruit, Coconut Juice & Mango Fried Ice ($4.25), while I had the Mango Pudding with Mango Fried Ice ($5.25).  I would describe the fried ice as mango juice being poured over an icy surface and then shaved off to resemble ice cream.  As a result, you get this icy cold and creamy concoction that's smooth and yummy!  \n\nWe were both very impressed with our choices and left with happy bellies.  You'll definitely find us back here again for Fried Ice!  I only wish they had longer business hours!\n\nSide note: Minimum charge is $3.00/pp.\n\nUpdate! 03/20/08 - I told you I'd be back for more Fried Ice!  Yum!  My aunt ordered their mango juice and it came in a huge generous glass.  So tasty!

I was pretty set on getting my favorite - Mango Pudding with Mango Fried Ice ($5.25), but the waitress said she preferred the Mango Fried Ice with Sticky Rice instead, so I got that! \n\n* Mango Fried Ice with Sticky Rice ($4.25) - I was expecting the sticky rice to be more like the Thai-style, forgetting that black sticky rice could be an option.  The black sticky rice gives it a more nuttier taste, a slight contrast from the sweetness of the mango fried ice.\n\n* Sea Coconut Fried Ice - My friend said she really enjoyed thee coconut fried ice part of it.\n\n* Sesame and Coconut Fried Ice - The sesame is the black kind that's a bit gritty and it's a slight contrast to the sweet coconut fried ice.\n\n* Papaya Juice with Milk and Sago - I really enjoyed the sago texture of this drink.  The BF expected a stronger taste from the papaya, so he was a bit disappointed.  Whereas the overall effect created a very subtle flavor.  (So, I guess it all depends on what you're hoping for with this drink.)  I think with would be really good with mango though!\n\nWe came in around 10 pm and there was one waitress working, and one guy in the back.  That was fine for us, but could be a bit chaotic if you came with a large party and you ordered a bunch of things.

The polenta is a minimal amount the covers the bottom of the dish, but a nice touch.  The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!\n\n* Beef Carpaccio \"Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\" - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.\n\n* Margherita Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil.\" - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.\n\n* Sliced Steak Bruschetta \"With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing.\" - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.\n\nUnfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)  \n\nThe bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.\n\nUpdate! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.\n\n* Brio Burger \"A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips.\" - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!\n\n* Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant \"Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce.\" - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.\n\n* Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce.\" - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.\n\n* Shrimptini \"Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon.\"  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.\n\n* Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta \"With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle.\" - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.\n\nThis time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.

With it being Vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!\n\nWalking in on a Saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.  Call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!  If you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.  They say they do offer the \"World's Largest Selection of Draft Beer.\"  You can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!  But if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.  It's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.\n\nThe best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.  The tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.\n\nWe went for a variety of appetizers to share:\n\n* Grilled Jamaican Wings: \"tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce\" $10.25 - A generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.  Full of flavor though and tasty!\n\n* Firecracker Wings: \"tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze\" $10.25 - Favored over the Jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.\n\n* Grilled Hearts of Romaine: \"topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette\" $8.95 - Good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.  Even the guys in our group were fighting over it!\n\n* Baby Leaf Spinach: \"portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette\" $7.95 - Not enough portabella mushrooms, but I like the Gouda.\n\n* Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip: \"main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a four cheese blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread\" $11.45 - Good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.\n\n* Barnaise Sliders: \"four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - The fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.  Even the thin fries taste good!\n\n* Classic Sliders: \"four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle\" $9.95 - Only okay after you try the Barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.  \n\n* Fresh Baked Brownie: \"topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream\" $7.95 - Takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.\n\n* Draft Beer Float: \"Lindeman's Framboise with vanilla ice cream\" $6.50 - Like a root beer float, but with Lindeman's.\n\nThey do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.  There's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.  The noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.  (Not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.  But a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.  We ran into quite a few people we knew that Saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)\n\nSince I'm still not a beer drinker, I like the Yard House because they serve up Lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and Wyder's.  I can drink something I enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.\n\nThey do offer Happy Hours: Monday through Friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; Sunday through Wednesday, 11 pm to close. Select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.  After 11 pm on Friday and Saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.  The crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.  There's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.\n\nThis place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their \"Kids Klub.\"  But you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.\n\nUpdate! 05/31/08 - This time tried their (Mac & Cheese)2 \"roasted chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil.\"  Next time, I'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.

We had a large party, about 14 people at the table.

It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.\n\nMy concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake \"mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm\".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.\n\nThe other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)

Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.\n\n* Maverick (red) for $11 \"Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava\" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.\n\nBites to eat:\n* Shishito Peppers ($2) \"grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon\" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn't really care for more.\n\n* Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.

I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.\n\n* Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I'm sad I didn't order more.\n\n* Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) \"cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain\" - Our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.

It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.\n\n* Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) \"shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce\" \u00e2\" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!\n\n* Rosca ($9) \"homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce\" \u00e2\" Recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.\n\nWe spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  So, the girl making our drinks also served us.  She was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\nOverall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nThey also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(Pics posted, of course!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "NsnZ5GhagXBKrCOelxVQxw"}

We thought we had missed the hotel since we were driving along for awhile.\n\nLoews Las Vegas is a hidden gem of a resort and I'm glad we found ourselves there.  \n\nTheir Restaurant Week menu offered you a choice among two starters, two entrees, and two desserts.  Luckily, the Big F and I agree on one really important thing, and that's food.  We easily decided to try the whole menu.  Just as we were about to put in our order, our waiter came by and told us they were out of hamachi.  That definitely put a damper on things and we looked over what we could substitute with hamachi.  As we perused over all the different rolls and sushi, the waiter came back and said they found more!  Yay!  \n\nService continued being a little quirky when steak knives soon appeared and an entr\u00e9e consisting of beef arrived in front of me.  When a second steak showed up in front of the Big F, we knew something was wrong.  We motioned to a waiter (not our original one), and told him we didn't think these were our entrees.  Our waiter swiftly took them away (as they were $100 pieces of steak)!  Then the Big F noticed some discussion going on at a nearby table and had a feeling that they received our starters.  Indeed, that is what happened!  All was sorted out and we finally got our meal! \n\nStarters, choice of:\n\n* Sashimi Trio \"cajun seared albacore, garlic ponzu sauce; togarashi seared tuna yuzu miso sauce; and yellowtail asian pico del gallo\" - Two pieces of sashimi each and what makes this fish different is their unique and complementing sauces.  They had us scooping up all the sauce we could!\n\nor\n\n* Sushi Sampler \"4 pieces hamachi verde: (yellowtail, scallions, Thai chilis topped with cilantro, and thinly sliced limes) and 2 pieces temari scallop (slices of tuna around spicy sea scallops with wasabi flying fish roe and wasabi aioli).\" - The hamachi verde is a refreshing sushi roll with the lime slices, but it's the temari scallop roll that was the real winner.  We really enjoyed the scallop and wasabi aioli, it had us wanting more!\n\nEntrees, choice of:\n\n* Miso Braised Kobe Short Rib \"shiitake mushrooms, grilled asparagus, crisp maui onions\" - One of their most popular dishes, and you can easily see why.  The morsels of meat were gently braised and quite delicious.  The buttery mashed potatoes were just fattening and oh-so good!  A heavy dish indeed!\n\nor \n\n* Opakapaka Lau Lau \"coconut ginger cream, kobocha squash and banana chutney.\" - Beautifully presented where they 'release' the banana leaves to showcase the hidden secrets that lay within.  I'm not one for cooked fish, but this was extraordinary.  Not dry at all, and the sweetness from the banana chutney adds a completely new dimension to it.  I would go back and order this again for sure!\n\nDesserts, choice of:\n\n* Chocolate Lava Cake - A molten center with lovely sauces and fresh berries that come with it.\n\n or \n\n*Asian Pear Tart - Oh my gawd delicious.  So good that it's not worth sharing.  The tart is flaky and light, and the asian pears are sweet and just perfect.  And the sauces that come with it only add to the happy hum in your mouth.  Worth driving out this way just for a slice of heaven.  It's definitely one of my favorite desserts ever.  You probably saw me licking the plate!\n\nOur waiter forgot that we ordered the sake flight, a sampling of four sakes ($19).  And when we told him midway through our meal that he could just forget about it, he decided instead to give it to us complimentary!  The four samples included \"shirakaberuga junmai, dewazakura \"oka\", hoyo \"fair maiden\", and creme de sake.\"  \n\nWe did notice that it was hard to find our waiter and it looked understaffed.  When we had a chance to chat with the waiter later on, he did confirm that it was understaffed that night, which definitely explains the mix-up with all the food.\n\nDespite all the weird service, I'd give Marssa a 4.5.  (I'm sure it would be a solid 5 during our return visit.  We're told we have to try their Dinner for Two Sushi Platters created by Master Sushi Chef Osama \"Fuji\" Fujita!)  Master Fuji was actually on hand when we left so we got to say hi too!  With him being the ONLY master sushi chef in Nevada, how can you resist not sitting in front of him?\n\nBut if we don't go for sushi, I'd definitely return for their other entrees instead.  This is one of my top choices for a nice date restaurant!\n\n(And you know pics are posted of this fabulous dinner!)\n\nUpdate! 12/08 - Returned for another fabulous visit.  This time we sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed wonderful food and fabulous service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bfvWK_R9eEsKqoJUy-BYEw"}

At first I thought they seemed a bit expensive, but once I got a look at these buggers I realized they were big ones!  The waiter brings a soy sauce dish with sliced ginger and we poured a bit of the black vinegar to mix with the ginger.  We attempted to pick up each dumpling without breaking them, but it proved fruitless.  Every single one broke as their skin stuck to the paper lining.  No hot juicy goodness inside at all, but rather all over the plate instead!  They were indeed meaty, but that's all they were, just meaty.  I wouldn't say they had a whole lot of taste, and the skins were dried out on top.  I've had better XLBs elsewhere, so they weren't a big winner for me.  \n \n* P29 Beef Roll ($6.99) - We had to order this because it was mentioned in the Las Vegas Weekly review and sounded interesting enough.  It's definitely unique and something we've never seen or tasted before, and probably the favorite dish of the night.  It's rolled into a big pinwheel, and pretty good.\n\n* H50 Chicken with Pickle Chili Sauce ($13.95) - The allure of 'pickle' was what prompted us to order this dish.  But there was no pickling in sight.  Just a spicy chicken dish with large pieces of red bell peppers.  Good, but not what we were expecting.\n\n* H98 Eggplant & Basil Prep. in Hot Pot ($8.95) - Looking for some vegetables, we chose this one.  It came in a pot with a flame going on underneath.  Pretty tasty, but not spectacular.\n\n* H108 Stir Fried Shredded Potato ($7.95) - Similar to a dish we've ordered at Yun Nan Garden, but this one lacked some much needed seasoning.\n\nService was good - tea was brought over promptly along with two menus.  The staff speaks English and asked if we needed water.  \n\nLeftovers of the chicken and eggplant tasted even better the next day!\n\nOverall, I came with high expectations of the XLBs, and it fell short.  The Beef Roll was the big surprise hit though.  The other dishes were good or average, but nothing to have me craving more.  The Husband enjoyed the service here much better than other Chinese restaurants we've encountered in Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g"}

It appears they kept the original inside dcor and the running water above and below creates a serene atmosphere.\n\nDescribing their food as 'sushi & gourmet fusion', you see a range of Asian techniques in their cooking.  \n\n* Boca Park Roll (Deep fried yellowtail topped with spicy tuna and scallions, served with eel sauce and spicy aioli.) - My favorite of those offered - eat it while it's hot!\n\n* Cucumber Wrap (A riceless sushi adventure with tuna, salmon, albacore, crab, avocado, and kaiware wrapped with cucumber.) - It's refreshing and light, and a nice contrast against other rolls with heavy sauces.\n\n* 9th Isle (Spicy tuna roll with spicy shrimp tempura, cucumber and kaiware sprouts served with sweet glazed unagi.) - Eel lovers and those scared off by the raw will enjoy this roll.\n\n* TNT (California roll topped with baked rock shrimp, shitake mushroom, and scallop with creamy aioli and sweet onion sauce.) - The mushroom topping dominates.\n\n* Baja Roll (California roll topped with marinated tuna, tomato, flying fish roe and green onion.) - One again, the toppings are coming off, but refreshing with the tomatoes.\n\n* Sea Stone Rainbow (A riceless sushi delight made with ahi tuna, salmon, snapper, and crab mix, rolled in soybean paper and served with balsamic-mango reduction.) - Reminds me of a spring roll and enjoyable for those watching their carb intake.\n\nDim sum offerings included the shrimp puff, which came with a mayo dipping sauce.  It was loaded with shrimp and yummy when eaten hot.  I also tried the steamed pork and vegetable purse, aka siu mai or pork dumpling.  These were standard with other dim sum restaurants.\n\nOne of my favorites was the Peanut Crusted Hibachi Satays (Grilled chicken thighs with cilantro, Fresno chiles, lemongrass, coconut, and soy peanut vinaigrette.).  It was full of flavor and the sauce was delicious!  The Beef Negimayaki (Tender and juicy teriyaki beef skewers with scallion kimchi filling, garlic and a light tomato relish.) was okay, the beef was rolled around the scallion and skewered, didn't taste as exception as it sounded.  The Stuffed Ahi Carpaccio (Thinly sliced ahi rolled around crab ceviche with jalapeno, salsa, baby greens and a ponzu glaze.) had a bit of caviar on top that made it decadent.\n\nA nice twist was the Haricot Vert & Asparagus Salad (Tomato concassee, frisee, chevre cheese and glazed walnuts with mustard vinaigrette.) which can be heavy with the goat cheese.  The nuts provide a sweet and crunchy texture to the softness of the cheese.\n\nOf the entre samples, my favorite was the Baked Miso Yaki Butterfish (Shiro miso, sake, mirin and ginger, served with braised coconut rice.).  The fish was soft and silky and the rice was like butter, so good!  The Grilled Black Angus Strip (Roasted garlic herb butter, served with cured tomatoes and roasted sweet potatoes.) wasn't as tender as I had hoped, but the potatoes were a lovely treat!  I heard great things about the Potato-Crusted Salmon (Served with stir-fried vegetables and a ginger lime butter sauce.), but it didn't live up to the excitement.  The potatoes were shoe-string and would come off in one piece and the salmon was standard.  The stir-fried veggies were julienne-cut, so the flavors were muddled together.  The Braised Tofu with Spicy Tomato Black Bean Sauce (Soft tofu coated in potato starch and fried in vegetable oil, braised in vegetable stock, soy and chili sauce and served with tomato concassee and black beans.) is typical of what I find at Chinese restaurants.  However, the tomato added a slight contrast that made it unique and possibly, a vegetarian's dream.  \n\nWith all the heavy eating, I was pleased with their dessert offerings.  They had two sweets to choose from - the Chocolate Zen and the White Chocolate Bliss.  I preferred the chocolate with its flourless, ganache-glazed dark chocolate cake over the white chocolate and coconut sponge cake.\n\nNot only did Sea Stone go all out on the food, they provided ample wine and sake tasting.  They had an extensive wine list, but their sake list is what kept me happy.  Not only do they offer traditional sake, but those who enjoy the sweeter side of life will enjoy Hana's fruit-based ones (Fuji Apple, Raspberry, and Lychee) and the Star Rabbit \"Blueberry Infused\" sparkling sake.  I'm a big fan of the sweet stuff, but the new discovery of the blueberry sparkling one was a fab find!\n\nOverall, Sea Stone is another Asian fusion restaurant in the Vegas scene.  Their market is different being off strip though and based in Boca Park.  They have a nice outdoor lounge area that would be great for after work dinner drinks and eats.  They offer some typical Asian fare and sushi, and some unique concoctions as well.  I'd be back to sample their other creative inventions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3_daLjiWHmTYr1PTtBFbrg"}

Wow!  A handful of my guy friends mentioned such an idea to me, and imagine their disappointment when I told them someone else beat them to the punch!\n\nWe see this place all the time as we dine next door at Swish.  We decided to grab an order to go to see what the fuss was all about.\n\nTaking advantage of their $8.08 special, it included a spam musubi, mac salad, two choices of entree and rice.  From the pics, it looks like we got the Krispy Chicken Krunch (chicken rolled in a seasoned battered, fried and topped with a special glazed sauce) and the Samoan Sami (seasoned corned beef and spinach, baked in coconut milk).  We weren't exactly sure how the order was going to come out, and hoped that it would be easy to eat later on.  \n\nWhen the order arrived to go, it was quite a few boxes and we realized this would not make it into the theater as we had hoped.  Bringing it home, some of the Samoan Sami had already come out of the box and was making a mess in the plastic bag.  The presentation of the food was alright.  I guess when you finally assemble it altogether, it looks a lot more appetizing.\n\nWhen it came down to it, it was more of a bento box dinner with Hawaiian influences.  I guess we were confused with it being a musubi place and thought the chicken and beef would be incorporated into a musubi of some kind.\n\nThe spam musubi did taste good, and the Samoan Sami had a nice taste to it too. The chicken wasn't crunchy by the time we got home, so it was okay.\n\nOverall, we just had different expectations from we actually got.\n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "XHr1GB8iQTLj4Q2kF229Xg"}

That's the first thing we noticed is how clean and orderly everything looked.\n\nWe stood at the counter for awhile as we decided what to order.  The guy working the register was friendly and super helpful.  He suggested we go for the \"4 Pc. Fish Dinner with 2 Sides\" ($10.99), so we did.  Our choice of sides were okra and greens.  (Other sides include french fries, cole slaw, baked beans, and potato salad.)  We were also intrigued by the Mac & Cheese Bites for $3.75.\n\nWe chose a booth to sit at as we waited for our order.  It was soon to arrive and we dug right in.  The catfish had a great coating that had lots of flavor and stayed crispy, keeping the fish moist inside.  It wasn't greasy at all, just like B.K. said.  The hush puppies that came with it too were pretty good as well.  I was really impressed with the Mac & Cheese Bites though.  It was the first time I had these and they were such a nice treat.  (I'm sure every kid would love these deep-fried macaroni and cheese goodies!)\n\nWe were also lucky to try out their Fried Green Beans and Corn Nuggets.  The deep-fried string beans were tasty too, with a good crunch.  The Big F loved the Corn Nuggets though.  It's like cream of corn that's been deep-fried, almost like a dessert.  \n\nThe Big F was craving for more fish, so he ordered another two!  ($2/each extra pc. fish)\n\nI would recommend eating in because things always taste better right when they come out of the fryer!\n\nThey do serve individual size bottles of wine if you're feeling fancy!\n\nSidenote:  The ladies' restroom only had hot water in there...and I do mean scalding hot water.

What most diners in the area don't know is that Cheeburger Cheeburger is actually a chain with over 50 locations!  \n\nWalking in, newbies will be surprised by the 50s-inspired diner atmosphere.  Their menu definitely takes some time to navigate, but you'll get the hang of it.\n\nBurgers - their main focus and what everyone really comes for.  You can have your meat cooked to your liking (medium, medium well, well) and in various sizes (5.5 oz, 7 oz, 10 oz, 14 oz).  Apparently, they have their own farm where the beef comes from.  What makes them over the top is the number of toppings available.  Things like sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, and artichoke hearts are only a sample of their 25 plus topping selection.  The Husband went for The Semi-Serious (7 oz) for $6.99.  With nine types of cheeses to choose from, he went for the Pepper Jack Cheese and a fair amount of toppings.  Melissa G. went for The Classic (5.5 oz) Wrap for $6.79.  She also added a few toppings too.\n\nIf it's not meat you crave, portabello mushroom and veggie burgers and wraps are also available.  Salads are also hearty on the toppings with over 25 choices to choose from.  I went for the Portabello Wrap for $7.99.  They offer white or whole wheat wraps and you get a signature sauce to dip your wrap in.  My wrap was okay, perhaps there's so much stuff going on that it's hard to enjoy the actual taste of the wrap itself.\n\nWe couldn't resist their \"Famous Fries & Rings\" and wanted to go for the \"Best of Both\" Basket, Regular order ($5.89), but the waitress dissuaded us by saying it was huge and we should really get a Half ($4.69).  Apparently, she underestimated our craving for fried foods, and we ended up ordering up another basket of fries (Small $2.59 / Medium $3.59 / Large $4.59).  We weren't too fond of the onion rings, but we did like the fries.  They also offer five signature sauces, so we did the Adventurous Flight of Three ($2.49).  Since two of us ordered wraps, we ended up trying all five - Creamy Cheese, Zesty Horseradish, Creamy Jalapeno, Sweet Pepper, and Garden Vegetable.  We overdid it with the sauces and maybe should have just chosen one for our fries.  They weren't anything special unfortunately.  \n\nBut the real winner is their milkshake selection.  With over 378,00 possible combinations, you can build any kind of milkshake you want.  The waitress did point out that once you get past the three topping combination, there's an excess of syrup as most of the toppings are syrup-based. (So, be sure to ask the staff what toppings are concrete versus syrup.)  I went for the Oreo Green Mint, Cookie Dough, and Heath Bar combination and it was REALLY good.  The Husband went for the Pina Colada and Berry Berry combo and his was pretty good too!  Melissa G. has Chocolate Banana Peanut Butter with Reese's Pieces.  They serve them up in two sizes - Half $3.59 or Regular $4.99.  \n\nService was okay, the waitresses were super friendly in the beginning but slacked off a bit as more business arrived and our section was left empty.  (We were seated in the back section, although they ended up closing it off and seating everyone else in the front.)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, we paid over $50 for dinner and that was not including tip.  Pretty expensive meal for a party of three at a diner.  For those who know what toppings to pick, you can get a better bang for your buck.  But if you prefer the no frills on your burgers, this place is not for you.  We'd go back for the shakes and fries, but not for the rings, burgers or wraps.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Qher1XRFuU8GnhA4BH7wog"}

So, we figure with Hurricane Grill & Wings advertising like mad about their 31 flavors, why not give it a try?\n\nWe walk in just as the game is starting and take a look at the menu.  The hard part really is deciding what flavors you want - we went for their Hurricane Wing Flavor Sample for $17.99.  It comes with 24 pieces of their jumbo wings or boneless wings, tossed with four sauces of your choice, celery, and ranch or bleu cheese dressing.\n\nIt took about half an hour for our order to go to finally come out.  We weren't the only one waiting though.  A bunch of people had called in their orders, and they weren't particularly pleased with the wait either.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm watching the dynamics of this place - they're trying to train a new girl, but I don't think they are doing a very good job of it.  The bar is REALLY close to where the tables are.  Therefore, if you plan on bringing your kids to this place, watch out for the foul- mouth drunks hanging out at the bar.  Dropping the F bomb every other second can be described as a not family-friendly environment.\n\nThe good thing about taking it to go is that they label each box with what flavor you got.  The bad thing is that they don't bother asking if you want ranch or bleu cheese, they just give you the ranch.  And the celery includes four pieces.  Also, we saw someone else get hot sauce for their to go order, so we were sure to ask for some of that too.\n\nOur flavor choices: \n\n* Sea Salt & Vinegar - We really couldn't taste the whole salt and vinegar concept, just tasted like deep-fried wings. Lacking in overall taste.\n\n* Ancho Chile Lime Sauce - Good flavor with a nice heat as well.\n\n* Habanero Lime Toss - A dry rub - nice heat as well, with a fresh squeeze of lime on top.\n\n* Hurricane's Garlic & Parmesan - Pretty good flavor with the cheese adding the funky smell and taste.\n\nWith wings, the BF loves Wing Stop.  My complaint with them is that their wings are too small, good flavor though.  Here - the wings are bigger with more meat and good flavors, if you choose the right ones.  I was dipping my wings in the ranch, bleu cheese, and hot sauce, so maybe there wasn't enough flavor for me.  Sometimes they don't have all the flavors available though as we heard they were out of a few. \n\nOverall, we'd go back.  But the wait alone sucked and I don't about dining in since the service seemed lacking.

As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).

Interesting choice. \n\nI went for the Yellow Curry Lunch Special with Tofu \"Thai yellow curry and Thai herbs served with Jasmine rice.\" ($6.95).   Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up! \n\nThe Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special \"Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice.\" ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.\n\nOverall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.

(Beer $3, Martinis $7)  We only stuck to the drink menu this time around.\n\nI started off with: \n\n* Coconut Cloud Martini \"Tommy Bahama White Sand Rum, Stoli Vanil vodka, Cruzan Coconut rum, cream of coconut, shaken, strained and sprinkled with toasted coconut.\" - A smooth drink of coconut goodness that has you transporting to the islands soon!  Their touch of toasted coconut on top really brings the drink together and gives it a nice crunch and aftertaste.  \n\nNext up: \n\n* Kohala Coladas \"Bacardi Superior rum and cream of coconut added to your favorite flavor - Mango, Key Lime and Pina Colada - blended with ice and topped with a dark rum float.\"  I went with mango for mine and you really can't go wrong with a colada here.  A piece of pineapple and an umbrella tops it off.\n\nThe Husband isn't usually one for 'fruity' drinks, but the lure of banana and coconut had him downing a few of these babies:\n\n* The BBC \"Bailey's and Emmet's Irish Cremes, fresh banana and cream of coconut, blended with ice.\" - What can I say but damn, this is good. It tastes like a coconut and banana smoothie.  At first you can't even taste the alcohol, which of course has you wondering if there's really any in it.  But once you get up, you'll feel it.  There's good stuff in there!\n\nIt wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon, compared to the other neighboring restaurants running happy hour.  I think it's because their bar is all inside and you do have a \"Tommy Bahama\" type crowd if that makes any sense.  Our bartenders were pleasant and drinks arrived quickly, so we had no problems with service here at all.  And there's live music too - someone playing a few cover songs is an added bonus.\n\nOverall, Tommy Bahama's is a more laid back place to be when you want to sip some umbrella drinks, feel like you're on vacation, and not get mixed up in the dress to impress crowd.  And plus, their drinks are yummy good and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0mPrp8m_caTxdSGfIxNtTw"}

It's a Japanese restaurant that specializes more in yakitori and street food.  (As other have mentioned, they do offer some sashimi, but that's not why you come here.)\n\nWith a party of four, we got to try a bunch of different things:\n\n* Raku's Tofu ($4) - Highly recommended by our waiter since he said they are the only one in Vegas that makes their own.  It's uniquely presented as a homemade tofu and comes with sides of grated ginger, scallions, and bonito shavings.  The texture and taste can be a bit surprising at first as it's definitely not your commercial tofu. But once you add a bit of the sides, and a little soy, it tastes pretty good actually.\n\n* Sea Urchin and Seaweed with Soup ($4) - Presented in an individual bowl, two coils of uni rest on a bed of seaweed in a light broth.  The uni was good, and a bit different because of the warmth of the broth.  I enjoyed this dish and would get it again.\n\n* Daikon Radish and Soft Fish Cake Oden ($1.50/pp) - Their Oden menu consists of ordering individual pieces and they are all placed together as they have been stewing.  The daikon was less than memorable, something I wouldn't have ordered on my own nor again.  The fish cake was good though, although not something I particularly crave.  The side of hot wasabi mustard adds some much needed heat and taste to this dish.  Definitely use it.\n\n* Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi ($9/pp) - Expensive, but good.  Depending on how the wasabi hits your mouth, it can be a shot up your nose or an enjoyable piece of meat.\n\n* Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic ($6) - The crispy slices of fried garlic is what makes this beef really good.  I think it's actually tastier than the Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi.\n\n* Chicken Breast wrapped with Chicken Skin ($2.50/pp) - Chicken breast is always boring to me, but what makes this enjoyable would probably be the fatty chicken skin.  The Big F enjoyed this, but it's not something I would order again.\n\n* Chicken Wing ($1.50) - I personally didn't get a taste, but the guys in my party enjoyed it.\n\n* Grilled Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce ($4) - The duck was very tasty and had a nice sauce to it.  Cooked well and enjoyable.\n\n* Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon ($2/pp) - Mushroom and bacon, need I say more? Good stuff.\n\n* Kurobuta Pork Cheeks ($2.50) - This is really good stuff, really fatty bad for you stuff I'm sure, but really good!  Eat it when it's hot!\n\n* Enoki Mushroom Wrapped in Bacon ($2.50) - The enoki adds a slightly different taste and texture that makes it really enjoyable to eat.  Both the bottom and top of the mushroom are texturally different as well.\n\n* Ground Chicken Portabella ($3.50) - Grilled portabellas are always good, add some chicken and seasonings and you can't go wrong.\n \n* Lamb Chop ($5) - The waiter claimed their lamb chops were fabulous and had people returning just for them. And I do admit, they were really good.  Nicely cooked to a medium rare and juicy!\n\n* Grilled Rice Ball ($5 for two) - The soy sauce grilled rice ball is tastier than the rice ball wrapped in the green leaf, so we ordered just this one.  \n\nWe tried ordering the Potato with Corn ($2.50), but they just ran out, same for the Foie Gras ($12).  They have daily specials that sound interesting, but be sure to ask about the price.\n\nService was okay.  With about three wait staff people, I had to ask for my tea to be refilled almost every single time.  (They should have just left the pot for me after my fourth refill.)  They also never bothered refilling our water.  With all the sodium, liquids were necessary!\n\nThe menu is simple, but can be a bit overwhelming your first time there.  We found the whole Oden (Dashi Broth Pot) menu to be a bit daunting with the per piece charge and probably wouldn't have ordered anything from here if it were just the Big F and I.  The Robata Grill menu is where it's all out.  However, since they charge per skewers, you'll end up ordering the $28 Kobe Beef Steak and not realize it!  Their Rice/Noodle/Soup menu sounds good, but worries me when I read \"Bite Size Salmon Roe Bowl\" for $10.  Is it really bite-size?\n\nIn regards to the bathroom, I didn't see what the big deal was.  Sure, it's aesthetically pleasing with bird sounds and fake flowers.   But nothing worth making a special visit out of it.  It's a new restaurant and a new bathroom, therefore it's clean!\n\nAs recommended, make reservations.  It wasn't really necessary last Friday evening when we went, but it does fill up and people do take their time.  So I would definitely try to make reservations if my party is more than two.  \n\nOverall, we did enjoy our experience here, but found it to be quite expensive.  $150 for 4, including tip and tax, with no alcohol seems a bit costly.  (None of us were 'full' since we headed over to Luv-It's for dessert!)\n\n3.5 stars.\n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

Our most recent visit was only last week as the Husband and I celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.\n\nWe attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  We did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  Sweet!  But yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.\n\nThe thing to look out for is the Specials Board.  They usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  The weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  During our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  The waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (For example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  They were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  They had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  So, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing Specials Board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  We do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!\n\nThese days we skip the Robata Grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  \n\nOne of our most favorite items is the Crispy Asparagus Okaki ($5).  It's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  I don't know why it's so good but it just is.  And when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  I just love it.\n\nAnother item we had on this last visit include the Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard ($10).  There's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  The foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  \n\nPoached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  You break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  It's a tasty nonetheless.  \n\nThe Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  The Husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  And it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.\n\nI always enjoy homemade tofu and Raku's Tofu (Whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  They server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.\n\nThe four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  Yum!\n\nSince they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  First off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on Spring Mountain! \n\nService on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  The waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.\n\nMy only real gripe was this: Although I usually love sitting at the counter so I can watch the chefs at work, I also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  One of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  I was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  It wasn't too long after when the Husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  When I inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  Yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  Yuck.\n\nNonetheless, we still do love Raku and would continue recommending it.  But alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!  \n\n4.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

They also offer a kids' menu for 12 and under.\n\nThe BF went for the \"Cactus Jack Omelet, made with nopalitos, chorizo, salsa, and monterrey jack cheese\" for $8.29.  It also came with hash browns or home potatoes.  It was a decent size order, but he thought it would be bigger.\n\nI went for one of their breakfast wraps, \"Chorizo, eggs, green chiles, potatoes, and cheese, made with two scrambled eggs in a flour tortilla and served with sliced tomatoes or cottage cheese for $6.99.  With a little hot sauce, it's your breakfast burrito.  It needed a bit more green action inside though.\n\nOverall, our breakfast items were okay.  They satisfied our breakfast cravings, and it was nice to try out a new neighborhood restaurant.  Service was okay, they could learn to work better as a team instead.  (We noticed other orders sitting in the window ready to be brought out to the customers, but the other waitresses didn't help with those.)  They do offer some cool jams and jellies for your bread, like apple jelly and peach jam.  \n\n(Pics of our brunch are in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZRHDA3fLcwQsrBqUEo8KIg"}

We knew right away it was best to get a combo - so #2 Honey Pig Combo for $59.99 it was.  It's meant for about three to four people, so we figured we could add more later on.  It comes with Korean Pork, Beef Prime, Neck Flesh of Pork, Hot Baby Octopus, Seafood Bean Paste Soup, Fried Rice, and either 1 bottle of Soju or Korean Beer.\n\nAfter putting in our order, the waiter came back with iced Korean tea.  This was actually the first time I have ever seen the tea served on ice and it was very refreshing.  Something so nice needs to be served in tall glasses instead of small regular tea cups.\n\nAbout nine different banchan was brought over, which included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, cucumber kim chee, green onion salad, fish cake, tiny fish, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, pickled daikon, a bean dipping paste, and my favorite - sesame oil with Korean salt.  He only brought over one dish of each, so we were soon requesting refills on just about everything.\n\nThe raw foods were soon to arrive and the waiter laid out the beef and pork onto the hot wok-like grill in the center.  He also added some bean sprouts and cabbage to the middle.  As we waited for our meat to cook, we dove into the banchan.  We also asked about the rice, which he then brought over five bowls of steamed white rice ($2/each).\n\nAs we devoured our meat and our grill became empty, we sat around wondering about our octopus.  It was sitting in a bowl on the next table, but we weren't sure what to do next since they had shut our fire off.  When we finally got their attention, they asked if we wanted our bill.  We asked about the octopus, and only then did he realize that it was still sitting raw on the next table.  So, he turned on the grill and cooked the octopus.  The BF asked about the soup, and only then did the waiter ask if we wanted our fried rice.  (Uh...yeah!)  We were quite bothered by this since they were already asking us if we wanted to pay and we hadn't received half of our meal still!  The fried rice was also added to the grill and we got two bowls of the soup to share amongst us.\n\nWe really enjoyed the food - it was tasty, great flavor, and just a good meal overall.  4 stars for food.\n\nThe service on the other hand is what makes me frustrated.  We were forgotten about, and I'm not sure if it's because we were in the corner or what.  We always had to ask about getting our tea refilled, and when we asked if we could just have the pitcher, they said no. (They only had one pitcher!)  I asked for more napkins, which never arrived until I asked again.  The different waiters would come by and shut the heat off before our food was cooked and it was just so hard to get their attention.  (One waiter finally mentioned that they were understaffed with only three waiters that night.  They just looked unorganized.)  We finally said we were ready for the check, which also took forever to come!  (Did they want us to pay or not?)  2 stars for the service.\n\nI'm used to getting shikhye at the end of the meal, but they didn't have it here either!  Argh!\n\nI definitely want to go back, but I can only hope the service will be a lot better the next time!  (And I'm sure we're going to bring a larger party the next time we come too!)\n\nSidenote: They offer a 20% from 10 pm to 8 am.  Are they open 24 hours then?  I'm not sure! \n\n(You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "cQJM8VpY21O3HVu7j_b7Vw"}

Well, this location is a dump!  It's super packed in here, and not necessarily with people, but with boxes and cans in the aisles.  \n\nCustomer service is practically non-existent at this location.  When I needed assistance, they were less than helpful.  One night, they were hollering at us to go to the registers and pay for our groceries as they were closing.  (I looked at my phone and it was only 8:45 pm!)  The manager practically blocked us off and said we had to pay for our stuff now because they were closed.  They also covered up all the vegetables before closing so you couldn't even look at their produce.  When we went to the meat department. the guy working back there was too lazy to cut a piece of meat for us.  He said we had to buy it as is!  (We think it's because he didn't want to rewash his knife and stuff again.)  I asked him to weigh some ground pork first so I could determine if I wanted more, and he said what he hand in his hand was half a pound.

Ugh! \r\n\r\nWell, the girls in our group had those \"Ladies Free\" passes, so we knew we weren't going to have to pay.  Now, where do we get these passes?  There are usually some random guys standing near the entrances of the Mirage scoping out the ladies and handing the passes out to them.  \r\n\r\nThe guys in our group, now that was another story.  We heard the cover was $20 for them, but some guy was meandering his way through the line selling those \"Guys Free\" passes for $10.  Of course, we knew he was making total profit.  But do we care?  Or course not!  We're saving $10!  I have no idea where they were giving these passes out, but this guy had a grip of them and he was making his way through the line selling them.

The 2008 version has three coupons for Siena Bistro and we've been meaning to check out their menu.  Last night provided the perfect opportunity.\n\nIt's a bit tricky getting there, thank goodness for the Magellan!  But when you do finally drive up to this place, you'll feel so far away from the busy lifestyle of Las Vegas because after all, it is located on a golf course.\n\nWe did a quick check of the menu to make sure there was something we both liked and immediately found a few choices that stood out.  The waiter told us to sit wherever we liked, and the Big F was immediately drawn outside to the fireplace.  After initially seating at one of the inside tables, the waitress asked if we wanted to sit outside since she noticed the Big F had taken a peek.  \n\nAs we chose our table closest to the fireplace, the waitress quickly set up our table and brought a candle out.  We almost had the outside seating all to ourselves this evening, which was nice.  (The other couple that did sit outside were so engrossed in themselves that it still felt like it was just us!)\n\nThe menu had  a nice variety of choices, without being overly expensive either.  After we made our choices, the waitress asked if we wanted any bread and butter, which we immediately said yes to.\n\nThe bread took awhile, and we were starving.  But it came out warm - crusty cheese bread rolls with melted Parmesan that were pretty grub.  We each had two and asked for more!\n\nOur entrees were soon to arrive.  We shared: \n\n* Peppered New York Steak ($19) \"12 oz 5 blended peppercorn marinated bone-in New York steak, caramelized onions,  melted bleu cheese crumble, Garlic whipped potatoes, chef's vegetables, and drizzled with a delicate demi-glace.\"  This dish not only looked great, but had so many complementing flavors going on.  The crispiness of the fried onions, the sweetness from the caramelized red onions, the bold taste of the melted bleu cheese, the creaminess of the mashed potatoes, and a pretty tasty piece of beef with peppercorns hidden throughout the meal.  The asparagus and carrots also added to this dish.  I was pretty impressed with this order.\n\n* T-Bone Lamb Chops ($18) \"2 pan seared 4 oz T-bone lamb chops served with an herb roasted tomato, and white beans.\"  I think I was so focused on the lamb chops part that I missed the 't-bone' part on the menu.  (They also have Lollipop Lamb Chops on the menu too.)  So, I was a bit more surprised when my order came out.  Two chops sat on a bed of white beans with two herb-stuffed Roma tomatoes resting alongside.  The chops were good, but missed something.  It helped with the sweetness of the tomatoes, but I think the white bean concoction drowned out the dish.  It reminded me more of a cassoulet because of the white beans.  I thought the beans were going to be more of a side dish than resting on the whole plate. \n\nService was decent, considering they were quite busy and we sat outside.  A lot of older people dine here, perhaps because of its location?  We wondered what it would be like during the day so you could check out the view which I'm sure would be gorgeous.\n\nOverall, we were surprisingly pleased.  We saw a few other dishes on our way out and it looked pretty good.  We're still trying to find a way to squeeze in another meal there before our coupon expires.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\n(Pics of our dinner are posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "2ZSX80pEmSfeH2h2Bb-Muw"}

Blue Fin Sushi definitely impressed up with the quality of their fish.\n\nFirst off, Blue Fin is a small restaurant - more like a mom and pop's place.  It's almost better to keep this place on the down low because I would hate to have to wait for a seat here.\n\nOur party of three plus toddler went for the AYCE dinner option at $25.95/pp.  \n\nFirst off - uni, limit one order per person and dinner only.  Because of the weather in California, they did not get their shipment.  Oh.  Would they be willing to give us an extra order of amaebi then?  Yes.  Sweet!  And when it arrived, it looked just fabulous and tasted good too!\n\nWe went to work ordering a bunch of nigiri and was pleasantly surprised with how they came out.  More often than not, AYCE sushi places just shove as many pieces on a plate as they can.  But they actually presented it quite nicely for us, which we appreciated.  We were especially impressed with their super white tuna, which I am certain was escolar.  (Super white tuna usually means albacore, so escolar is definitely a highlight!)  \n\nTheir version of ikura was a bit different - it actually seemed like they made it themselves since the eggs didn't separate and were still within the sac, if that makes any sense.\n\nAnother highlight was their spicy rolls - I'm not a fan of the Sriracha-based kind and this was mayo-based.  Yum!\n\nWe also really enjoyed their Soft Shell Crab Tempura (limit one order per person, dinner only).  It had a nice batter and was definitely tasty!\n\nThe Husband ordered the Grilled Yellowtail Collar (limit one order per person, dinner only), but hoped they had forgotten since he was getting full.  When it did arrive, it was a huge piece!  It looked like the equivalent of two collars usually served at other restaurants!\n\nAnother highlight - unlimited dessert! Green tea and red bean ice cream, mochi ice cream, and tempura ice cream are available.  The tempura ice cream is a huge scoop and we were surprised with how generous it was.\n\nService did take a bit long, and we were there for a good while, more than the hour time limit.  But there was only the only waitress and the restaurant definitely was filled to the max while we were there.  In this case, we didn't mind - but if it was just the two of us, we might have gotten a bit anxious.\n\nOverall, Blue Fin Sushi is a place I would recommend for good quality sushi.  I can't comment on their fancy rolls, but we liked what we ate and would definitely go back!\n\nThere are outdoor tables, but I'm not sure it they open them up when the weather gets better or not.\n\nLunch (11:00 am to 3:00 pm) $21.95/pp\nDinner (3:00 pm to 11:00 pm) $25.95/pp\n60 minute limit\n\nUpdate! (05.12.10)\n\nWent back for a return visit and we were both pleased with our experience there.\n\nOnly a handful of customers sitting at the sushi bar, and that's where we chose to sit as well.  Ordered a bunch of nigiri and they had uni this time as well.  The soft shell crab was served up on a nice bed of salad greens with a sauce on it this time, which wasn't a problem since we asked for no sauce the next time.  Overall, we took our time and was out within an hour.  They didn't disappoint on quality at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2vQoWGEcSSBIJtUiGRKi5g"}

Growing up in San Francisco, I used to watch the tourists enjoy the theatrics at the famous Benihana restaurant in Japantown.\n\nIt all looked like fried rice to me and I always wondered how the food got properly divided when you have multiple parties at your table.\n\nAfter watching a teppanyaki competition on the Food Network, I realized there was a bit more to just cooking on a propane-heated flat surface grill.\n\nFirst off, it helped that the Husband and I had the teppanyaki chef all to ourselves.  Sure, it's not likely you'll get that experience, but it definitely contributes to a good or bad evening.  Chefs with a good personality will give a good show and everyone will have a good time.\n\nI chose the Chicken and Scallop Combination Dinner ($24.95), while the Husband chose the New York Steak and Chicken Combination Dinner ($26.95).  They both came with miso soup, ginger salad, steam rice, shrimp and seasoned vegetables.  \n\nThe waitress was a smart one - she offered edamame to start when she got our beverage orders.  And suggested the fried rice option when we put our food orders in.  We declined and she offered one order so we could share it.  For $2.95 more, we upgraded one of our steamed rices to a fried rice.\n\nWhen it came down to it, our chef was entertaining and engaging.  He did a few tricks that we didn't see during the competition, and that had us a bit surprised.  He was friendly and personable, and it did make for an enjoyable eating experience.\n\nFood-wise, we were both pretty full surprisingly.  Was it worth the $50?  Not really.  (It helped that we had a BOGO free entree with the Entertainment card.)  It was definitely something to experience at least once.\n\nNot only do they have teppanyaki tables, but regular tables and a small sushi bar.  Most diners were enjoying the teppanyaki experience here though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LTyUyGdEvDsdpvxszrTZDw"}

I'm addicted to foot massages, or rather, what comes along with the foot massages.  (Thank goodness the Big F has the same problem.)

On this occasion, Tan had my feet sitting in a hot water bath as he worked on my shoulders, head, and neck.  At this point, I really could care less if he got to my feet.  But after spending a few minutes on my arms, he reclines my chair back as he gets working on my feet.  In our semi-private room, the Big F is seated next to me in his own reclining chair having May work on his tired feet as well.

They asked if we could wait five minutes and we took a seat.  The first things I noticed was how dark it was, creating a more relaxed atmosphere than other places.  As other employees were finishing up, they came out to the front and greeted us.  Their hushed tones added to the quietness of this place, and we both appreciated how friendly everyone was.  And they asked if we wanted anything to drink before our treatments.\n\nWe were seated shortly in our semi-private room for two.  They brought out a hot herbal bath for our feet to soak in and came around behind us to start working.  (Yay - no wasted time here!)  As they start working on our neck and shoulders, they ask how long we would like.  We tell them we want 45 minutes, and they do try to persuade us for the 60 minute one, but we're okay right now.  For the next 15-20 minutes, the girls are working on our head, face, and neck.  My girl (Rosa) was scratching my scalp like no tomorrow and it was definitely getting me in the zone.  Aww...this is the perfect way to start - head first as your feet soak and then move down your body!\n\nWhen they come around to the front of us, they push our shoulders and arms for a bit before taking our feet out of the bath.  They also push your seat back so it reclines entirely.  After my feet are dried, she quickly dumps out the hot water bath and returns to get working.  She rubs some sort of ointment on my right foot before wrapping it up and then starts working on my left foot.  I am super relaxed now and I can hear the Husband breathing steadily next to me.  (Yes, he has fallen asleep, this is definitely a good sign!  May was working on him.)  I can feel myself wanting to fall asleep too because I am feeling pretty good.  Eventually, I do zone in and out of sleep, but just for a second.    \n\nThey do move to my right foot eventually and I'm practically sleeping, so it all feels good.  After the massage, they wipe your calves and feet down with a hot towel.  They then roll down your pants legs and push on your legs and thighs a bit.  You sense the closing movements of your massage and are sad to know the time has come.  And they also offer us something to drink afterward instead of waiting around for a tip (like a few other places).\n\nThey do a good job here, it's thorough and professional and there really are no complaints. (I would complain more about the other guests who talk very loudly because they are inconsiderate and do not realize we can hear everything of their conversation.  So please hush your voices when you enter!)  Also, when our girls did speak to each other, it was in hushed tones as well.\n\nThey are busy and had a steady stream of customers coming in and out, which can be distracting.  The Husband says he prefers to go late at night when there's less foot traffic, and I will have to agree.\n\nThey do accept VISA or MasterCard, but their credit card machine runs very slowly and is a bit of pain.  So, they prefer cash if possible.  They also have you sign your name in after the treatment as to keep track of their clients, which we find quite professional.\n\nWe'll return here often, recommend others here, and probably go for the 60 minute one the next time we come.\n\n$28 for 45 minutes\n$38 for 60 minutes\n$48 for 75 minutes\n$55 for 90 minutes", "type": "review", "business_id": "VMvjtu59HJEuJwmzXI9Mmg"}

Finally, a sushi place in our neck of the woods and an all-you-can-eat one too, no less!  (Even better, the Husband was more than familiar with their first location after being a regular there.)\n\nJoining us was Melissa G. and another friend from SoCal who never gets AYCE sushi ever.  The dinner menu is $23.95, which is cheaper than some of the other sushi restaurants around.\n\nIt was pretty empty on a Saturday night, but we figured it was because of the location more so.\n\nThe menu selection is pretty standard with appetizers, nigiri, sushi rolls, and ice cream included in the AYCE.\n\nAppetizers: \n\n* Age Tofu (Deep Fried Tofu With Tempura Sauce) - Not quite like other restaurants where it sits in broth with bonito flakes.  Rather it's slices of soft tofu, lightly deep-fried, and tempura dipping sauce.\n\n* Shrimp Tempura - Standard, nothing special.\n\n* Green Mussels (Baked Mussels with Special Mayonnaise) - When we ordered this, we thought it was just regular baked green mussels.  It's more like \"Dynamite\" because of the mayo sauce and served in a scallop shell.\n\n* Yakitori (Grilled Chicken on Skewers with Teriyaki Sauce) - The Husband ate all of them, so I guess it was okay.\n\n* Seafood Ragoon (Deep-Fried Mixed Fish and Cream Cheese Wrapped in Wonton Skin) - It had a stronger salmon taste, and a dipping sauce would have been a good complement to it.\n\n* Miso Soup\n\n* Cucumber Salad (Sliced Cucumber with Sesame Dressing) \n\nNigiri:\n\n* Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) - Limit of one order of two per person.  It wasn't exactly what I called amaebi, the raw sweet shrimp.  It's a fake and bad substitute of two pieces of cooked shrimp sitting on rice.\n\n* Albacore (White Tuna)\n\n* Cajun Albacore\n\n* Hamachi\n\n* Garlic Tuna\n\n* Ikura (Salmon Roe)\n\n* Saba (Mackerel)\n\n* Sake (Salmon)\n\n* Hotate (Scallop) - Before ordering this one, we asked if the scallops were small ones mixed up with stuff or the larger variety.  The waitress confirmed it was the larger variety sliced in half and laid over the rice.  Well, when she brought it over, it was the former variety and not what we wanted.  It's a good thing we only requested one order since we ended up not eating it.  The waitress said it was because she was new and didn't know.\n\n* Uni (Sea Urchin) - Limit of one order of two per person.\n\nFrom the first bite of sushi, we knew that we weren't going to be happy.  The sushi rice was mushy and lacked the vinegar that makes it sushi rice.  Over and over again, I was getting less than impressed with their rice.  Blah.\n\nSushi Rolls:\n\n* Salmon Skin Handroll\n\n* Spider Roll (Soft Shell Crab, Crab Salad, Masago & Eel Sauce) - Melissa G. wasn't too impressed with their version as they use a different batter so it comes out a lot darker and not as tasty.  It was alright.\n\n* Something Wrong Roll (Deep Fried Assorted Dish Fish Roll with Spicy Sauce) - It's tasty because it's deep fried and sits in a bed of mayonnaise spicy sauce.\n\n* Catepillar Roll (Fresh Water Eel, Cucumber & Topped with Avocado and Eel Sauce)\n\n* Kiss The Ass (Spicy Spider Topped with Spicy Crab) - I didn't even realize there was a soft shell crab inside because the crab concoction dominates the roll.\n\nBefore we started ordering any of the rolls, I asked the waitress if they used Sriracha to make the hot sauce.  After much confusion, she finally went to the sushi chef to ask.  They were making a big deal out of it as if I was asking for the secret recipe to their spicy sauce when all I wanted to know is if they use it at all.  The final answer, yes.  I'm not a big fan of the stuff in my sushi.\n\nDessert:\n\n* Green Tea, Plum, and Mango Ice Cream - Pretty good ice cream, and we all had our share.  Good stuff!\n\nService could use some improvement.  With only two parties present, our waitress was too busy socializing than getting our order or refilling our tea and water.  Some orders were forgotten and needed some reminding.  The other waitress was a bit pushy about rushing me to clear a plate off as she waited so she could take it away.\n\nOverall, we were less than impressed and won't be going back.  It was just disappointing and screwing up the basic sushi rice is a bad sign.", "type": "review", "business_id": "w2laxcyc6QS28DLbXnfAMg"}

He initially chose \"Hot\" for their heat level and I reminded him that others have commented on how extra hot their heat was here.  So, he changed it to Medium.

I also went for Medium too, but did wish it was spicier after we got it.  I also appreciated the mix of veggies in there - string beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, carrots, bell peppers and cucumbers.\n\nAnother incentive was that they were now offering all day lunch specials and a free brown rice upgrade.  Well, this wasn't the case anymore when we went.  (Although they still had the lunch special signage outside even though it was clearly dinner time.)  Brown rice now costs $.50 more.

Well, that happened to me last night as I gorged and gorged on an endless supply of meat at Texas de Brazil.  And boy, was I paying for it afterwards.  I was drunk...on food.  I was delirious from overeating, my eyes were glossy, and I could barely walk straight.  I had eaten myself to oblivion.\n\nAfter our waiter (Adam) gave us the whole introduction of how it worked here, we helped ourselves to the salad bar.  I was pleasantly surprised with their offerings and loaded up on marinated artichoke hearts, cooked mushrooms, quinoa, au gratin potatoes, marinated garlic gloves, shrimp, their soup of the day (lobster bisque), and all their other good stuff.\n\nThe Big F was taking a bit too long to turn his little card over to green, so I started without him.  Meanwhile, the sides were soon to arrive.\n\n* Garlic Mashed Potatoes - I was too busy enjoying the creaminess of the au gratin potatoes to give much attention to the mashed version.\n\n* Sweet Fried Bananas - This is probably what put me over the edge.  It was so sweet and sugary good and I ate a lot of it, and I do mean a lot.  The cinnamon on these bananas just had me wanting more and more.  And I probably did take a bite of the banana in between every bite of meat, I just couldn't help it.  It was that good.  And the Big F was having more than his share too!\n\n* Brazilian Cheese Bread - It was good, but I had better.  Just as well since I didn't need that for an additional filler.  The Big F finished off the bread basket on his own!\n\nThey usually offer around 8-15 kinds of meat in one day, among the meats that I tried: \n\n* Cordeiro - Young leg of lamb that is tender and full of flavor.  Definitely a good one!\n\n* Costela de Carneiro - My favorite out of the bunch, the lamb chop.  It was one of the first meats I tried and it was the last thing I ate.  It was so tender, juicy, and just good.\n\n* Signature Garlic Picanha - The crispiness outside edge of the rump cover was so good and tender.  One of our favorites!\n\n* Filet Mignon Wrapped in Bacon - It started off tender, but ended up okay in the end.  Stick to the picanha instead!\n\nThey did have chicken and pork roaming around, but I chose to pass on them this time.  I was too preoccupied with the beef and lamb choices.  I did try a few other meats, but they were less memorable.  There's a couple of dipping sauces for the meats, including the mint one for lamb and something else humming of garlic.  (I got a bit of it on my sleeve and was smelling it the rest of the night!)\n\nService was good and attentive.  They really make an attempt to please you and make sure you leave happy and satisfied.  I don't know how one manages to make it to dessert after you ate so much meat.  The carrot cake alone is a huge three-layer slice!\n\nIt's definitely the kind of place for hardcore meat lovers ($45/pp) and even vegetarians would do all right if they stuck with the salad bar ($30/pp or so).  Children 6 and under eat free, but 7-12 are half price. \n\nRESERVATIONS highly recommended!  You can do that through OpenTable.com too!\n\nWhen you sign up for their eClub, you get a 25% discount (up to a party of 8) if you dine their within the next month!  That's a pretty good deal, especially when celebrating an event.  \n\nWe'll be back once I recover!\n\n4.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "ryvMJK6AlbU35HKrlFT61w"}

The menu at Cafe Deia caught our attention, along with a few other specials they were offering.\n\nStarting off with their White Sangria ($20 pitcher), I found it to be a bit strong and not sweet enough.  I had to ask for some simple syrup so I could enjoy it morel.  Like Amy S. mentioned, they could really use some real fruit in there.  I like my sangria loaded with fruit and it's mostly lemon slices in there.\n\nA pretty large menu to choose from, but we decided to go with tapas all the way.\n\n* Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese \"Thinly sliced imported Serrano ham served with Manchego and a French baguette\" ($9) - Highly recommended by our waiter, Chris.  Warm baguette arrived with a few slices of cheese and salty ham. Yes, it's good and very rustic.  Reminds me of the kind of food you grab for a picnic when you're overseas.  They give you more bread if you need it too!\n\n* Tuna Tartar \"Diced ahi tuna mixed in wasabi, soy sauce and Asian chili paste served with avocado and green onions\" ($8) - The avocado and tomatoes are served in a crispy shell with the tuna mixture and hard-boiled egg bits on the side.  Good, but needs some assembling if you want to get all the tastes in your mouth at once.\n\n* Shrimp Ceviche \"Tiger shrimp cooked in lime and lemon juice, mixed with avocado, cucumber, red onions and chili pepper\" ($9) - Generous on the shrimp and tasty!  It was good on its own and presented in a nice manner too.\n\n* Bacon Wrapped Figs \"Fresh figs wrapped in bacon and pan seared\" ($7) - My absoluter favorite dish of the evening.  A total flavor explosion in your mouth!  The balsamic vinegar sauce adds a nice acidity and sweetness, and is just delicious!  \n\n* Stuffed Mushrooms \"Stuffed Chorizo mushrooms, and baked to perfection.\" ($4) - Yummy little buggers as well, along with the balsamic vinegar sauce drizzled on the bottom.  Good stuff! \n\n* Black Mediterranean Mussels in Garlic White Wine Sauce \"Sauteed in garlic and white wine\" ($9) - Came with bread which is needed to sop up all that wine and garlic sauce laying beneath the mussels.  Yum.\n\n* Mallorcan Soup \"the only soup you can eat with a fork! pork, vegetables and bread slowly cooked in olive oil and natural juices\" ($5) - It's 'interesting' if anything.  More stew-like, and not one of my favorites although the Husband enjoyed it.\n\nDessert menus are delivered in a letter.\n\n* Fruit Beignet $3 - Pretty disappointing.  Nothing to rave about.  The batter had hints of all the other savory foods that it was fried with.\n\n* Chocolate Banana Crepe ($5) - Highly recommended by our waiter, especially since I wasn't impressed with the beignet.  The crepes were okay, a bit too thick for my liking.  Reminded me of pancakes, which I'm more of a waffle kind of girl.  Simple crepes, folded over, then slices of banana, chocolate sauce, and powdered sugar go on top.  \n\nI think the Spanish Creme Brulee ($7) or Chocolate Lave Cake ($7) would have fared better.\n\nWe did try ordering:\n\n* Sausage Platter \"Assorted imported Spanish sausages served with a French baguette\" ($8) - Our waiter wasn't too fond of this and pushed the Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese dish on us instead.\n\n* Albondigas \"Ground beef meatballs served in a spicy tomato sauce\" ($5) - Again, we wanted to order this, but was discouraged to do so.  Just as well from reading all the other reviews about this dish.\n\nOverall, service was good.  Chris was attentive as well as the other staff that helped along.  The food came out a bit too fast for the two of us, so we had to make room quickly at our table.  The chef came by at one point to check on our meal, which I definitely appreciated that personal touch.  (The Husband also noticed the chef helping out with front room duties too.)  We also saw salads made table side, which is totally unnecessary but a nice presentational effect.\n\nThey have a lot of promise.  An outdoor eating area with firepit and happy hour specials can definitely pull in the crowds.  We went during their Mardi Gras specials.  The tapas we ordered are perfect for two to three sharing, maybe even four.  They also serve up salads, paellas, burgers, and pizza if you want something more for just yourself too. \n\n(Pics posted!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "z5rCzrAgc91fHt006tjRjw"}

She was surprised that we wanted it, but yes, they definitely did have it!  When she brought it out, she did say it wasn't that cold yet since they were just making it.

With the recent opening of Jenni Pho, it satisfies your basic pho desires.\n\nJenni Pho is a clean restaurant with an open kitchen viewable through the glass window, something you don't see often in Vietnamese establishments.\n\nTheir menu is quite limited (versus others), focusing on a handful of pho bowls, broken rice dishes, stir fried noodles, and cold noodle bowls.  They also offer boba and slushed ice drinks.  And yes, it's a bit more expensive than Spring Mountain restaurants.\n\nI've been here a few times, sticking to the pho dishes.  Most recently I ordered the \"Create Your Own Bowl\" for $6.95.  You can choose  up to five items among 8 for your own combo.  I went for the fatty flank, steak, meat balls, crunchy flank, and tripe.  (The other three are brisket, tendon, and flank.)  They only have one size available, which is a cross between the small and large in other restaurants. \n\nThe Husband ordered the Bo Kho (Beef Stew Noodle Soup) for $7.50.  He asked for egg noodles, which costs a dollar more.  When we actually got the bowl, regular rice noodles were there.  We told the waitress and she offered to take it back and change out the noodles but we were hungry and didn't want to wait.  We just wanted to be sure we weren't charged for the noodle change that didn't happen.\n\nThey do offer a decent amount of noodles and meat in their version.  \n\nOverall, Jenni Pho has had a steady stream of customers when we visit.

The waffle iron fries could be seasoned too.  The mac n cheese was very creamy though.\n\n* The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Spicy Hot Links and Fall Off the Bone Pork Ribs, Fried Onion Tanglers, Baked Potato Casserole - The spicy hot links weren't all that spicy or impressive, sadly enough.  And the pork ribs were just okay.  We were expecting something different from the baked potato casserole when all it ended up being was mashed potatoes with some fixings.

Windmill Lane, we couldn't ignore the \"izakaya\" sign.  Spectacular reviews on yelp gave us the final push to check out this restaurant we've been so curious about. \n\nWeekday evening and happy hour has just ended (5 pm to 7 pm), so we're seeing an 'interesting' mix of people hanging out at the sushi bar.\n\nUpon seating, it's hard to ignore the menu because there is just so much to go through.  There's the Sushi and Sashimi menu, the \"You Pick\" Menu that includes Side Orders, the regular a la carte menu, the dinner combination menu, the Vegetarian menu, and the beverage menus.\n\nAfter some careful perusing, we decided to go with items from the You \"Pick\" Menu, Pick 3 - $15.95; Pick 4 - $19.95; Pick 5 - $24.95.  The waiter suggested we do the Pick 4 since we planned on ordering other things as well.\n\n* Wafu Yakiniku \"Tender sliced beef with Miko's special sauce.\" - Steaming plate of tender and juicy pieces of beef.  Pretty good.\n\n* Shishamo \"Grilled roe capelin\" - Four pieces of smelt in this order.\n\n* Sashimi \"Chef's choice of sliced raw fish\" - A nice selection of raw fish, about five large slices.\n\n* Oyako-Don \"Topped with simmered chicken and egg\" - This dish arrived last.  It was a steaming bowl of chicken, onions, and scrambled egg on rice with sauce.  We were too full to enjoy this, so we packed it for home.\n\n* Tonkotsu Ramen \"Ramen noodles and pork flavored soup.  Served with Miko's Gyoza\" ($9.50) - Looking quite pretty with it's hard-boiled egg, fish cake, and vegetable greens floating on top, the soup looked pretty authentic.  However, the tonkatsu wasn't quite what we expected.  We're used to pork cutlet that's been breaded and fried, and this wasn't the case.  There was pork in the soup, but not what we know as tonkatsu.  (Maybe they got the order wrong?)  The gyoza was also a bit different - it's completely deep-fried and looks more like a flattened eggroll than a gyoza. (Update!  Candace C. was so nice to point out that tonkotsu ramen is actually a pork bone broth ramen, so that was our mistake that we were expecting tonkatsu - the deep fried pork cutlets!  See how one letter can change what you're expecting! At least now we know!)\n\n* Agedashi Tofu \"Fried tofu in special broth\" ($3) - The lone block of tofu was more fried than I hoped, and there wasn't much of a broth.  It was more like a light sauce on the bottom.\n\nBeyond the food, we couldn't help but notice the dynamics of the staff.  Sure, it definitely seemed like it was bit understaffed as the owner's husband was the waiter and busboy for the evening.  We also noticed one lone sushi chef and a prep cook behind the sushi bar.  The latter two were not the most professional using language like \"asshole\", etc. from behind the sushi bar and hollering up to the front.  I also found it weird that the girl who was hanging out at the sushi bar when we arrived eventually went behind the sushi bar to help out.  (Maybe she works there?  Her purse and phone were still by her seat.)\n\nService was a bit slacking, only because Miko's husband was responsible for front of the house and he was alone.  We did have to ask for plates, refills, etc.  He did bring us complimentary miso soup though before our meal, which was a nice touch.  Before we left though, he chatted with us a bit and told us more about his wife's restaurant.  Having opened in September of 2008, they were doing quite well.  Then with the struggling economy, they have since expanded their menu to accommodate more diners and their various likings. A 65 year old Japanese chef overseas the kitchen and the recipes are authentic Japanese ones.  However, with the younger staff up front, they do maintain a different image for the younger crowd and dominates this restaurant and has pretty much taken over the sushi bar.\n\nI'm torn, I want to like this place for what it stands for and where it came from.  But I was turned off by the antics of the kitchen staff.  When I'm looking for more authentic Japanese home cooked food, this place would be a good consideration.  I think they need to work on getting the food out at the proper times too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5AKTjYSVTT4z_yWmTMrEXA"}

And the pork lau lau was ono delicious!  \n\nYou can't go wrong at Island Flavor, we're glad it's in our neighborhood and definitely hope they stick around.\n\nTheir only downfall - they are closed on Sundays and Mondays!

(1/2 pan size kalbi short ribs = $80) Imagine my disappointment when several of the short ribs were blackened, as in burned. They sat on the bottom of the tray and went unnoticed for awhile. We were wondering why our guests weren't eating them and that's when we saw the unsightly pieces. My mom went to the restaurant later on that week to let them know. They took down our phone number and said they would call us to talk about it. No one called. A few months later, my mom returned and went in to talk to them and again was told someone would call us to talk about it. We were told that usually the owner would have checked out our order before it went out, but on that particular day, she came in after we picked up the order. Therefore, she never saw the order go out.  Again, no call from them.\n\nBecause I was so disappointed with that experience, the food and the lack of customer service, I decided to just not eat there anymore.\n\nAfter almost a year of protesting, we finally decided to order food from there again. I initially tried ordering Pork Lau Lau on a Friday, but was told they didn't have any. I ended up with the combo Kalbi short ribs and furikake shrimp. My short ribs were blackened again! However, the Husband's order of short ribs were just fine. Also, the shrimp just didn't taste that great anymore. My Mom always orders the oxtail soup and always comments on how fatty their version is. You can see chunks of fat on theirs that probably should have been trimmed a little. (I'm all down for a little fat, but theirs is just too much.)\n\nTheir tuna poke salad, both raw or cooked, was pretty damn good...especially the dressing. But it's since doubled in price and not really worth it anymore. \n\nOverall, I'm pretty sad that Island Flavor isn't in our repertoire of food choices these days. Quality and service had just gone down since they first opened and I get a sour taste in my mouth when I think of them now. With their current 4.5 star rating on Yelp, they won't be hurting for business I'm sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VkPzsY09S4zO0XqhA1mc6Q"}

Two dipping sauces accompany this dinner, the first being a ponzu and the other possibly being of a sesame variety.  After cooking your meat and veggies in the hot broth, dip your food into both sauces before consuming.  Its all the flavor you'll ever want!  For $14.95, you can have the Prime Rib Eye Sukiyaki dinner, which also comes with a platter of veggies, udon noodles, and a raw egg.  Their sukiyaki sauce has quite a bit of flavor and the BF was impressed with their concoction.  They pour this stuff into a hot pan and start cooking your food in this sauce.  All dinners come with a bowl of rice and a couple of side dishes of kim chee and pickled goodies.  Be sure to add the garlic, radish, and green onions to your shabu shabu or sukiyaki, it adds a lot more flavor overall.\n\nFeel free to ask for more rice, kim chee, and pickled stuff since there's no additional charge for it.  (Double check though!)  The BF and I left pretty full, and it appears they offer a bit more veggies than Swish does.\n\nBusiness is still slow at this location since there's not too much traffic yet around here.  We were the only ones there at 7 pm, but by the time we left, three other parties had joined us.  Employees were helpful in cooking practically all our food for us, and I wasn't sure if this was standard practice or because they were so slow.  (I can't imagine how they could cook everyone's stuff for them if they were packed.)  It can feel a bit rushed when they do all the cooking for you, so feel free to tell them you can take over at any time.  It can get messy with them picking out all your food for you, but depending on your chopsticks skill, maybe you do want them to do it for you.\n\nThey also offer plenty of tables for those not interested in cooking up their own food.  It's a pretty small and straightforward menu at Little Geisha.  Let's see if they can last longer than Nina's did!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VS5fjHl3mtfaaOHI74UoYw"}

Definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two people!\n* Korean Seafood Pancake - Loaded with lots of seafood, and really good.\n* Spicy Sashimi - Generous portion, but perhaps a bit too much. \n* Something Wrong Roll - Whatever was in there, it was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece.\nOur waitress was super helpful and we didn't know what else to order beyond the seafood pancake.  She made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with her suggestions.    \n\nSecond visit: \nNew addition to the menu is AYCE sushi for $22.95 (until midnight).  Beyond the standard nigiri, rolls, and appetizers, we also had:\n* Bulgogi (steamed beef) - Generous for one, so go with one order first to see if it's something you like.\n* Skewers: bacon & shrimp, gingko, garlic, chicken gizzard, shrimp, beef\nCame for a small party and they were very accommodating for our group.  Even brought out a special dessert for the birthday boy and didn't complain with all the splitting of the checks.  Our waiter, Sunny, took care of us and really made sure we were having a good time.\n\nThird visit: \nAYCE sushi again!\n* Steamed black mussel\n* Ahi poki\n* Fried jabchae\n* Spicy Korean ramen\n* Skewers: bacon & scallop, mushroom\n\nService was a bit slower this time, but they apologized and threw in a bottle of free beer.  We didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our meal more. \n\nTheir nigiri is pretty good.  Generous slices of fish and not a whole lot of rice.  That's pretty much what had us coming back the second time for AYCE.  Skewers as part of the AYCE menu is also what we enjoyed - especially the chicken gizzards, the garlic, bacon & scallop, shrimp, beef, etc.  Their steamed black mussels came with a creamy sauce that was good.  Soft shell crab appetizers are also available, including tempura.  Noodle dishes included are udon and ramen.  Rice dishes include fried rice, teriyaki chicken and beef bowls.\n\nDessert is limited to vanilla, strawberry or green tea ice cream, limit one.\n\nFor a relatively new restaurant, they are busy!  We even saw Mr. Lee's son the last two times we went! (From Lee's Liquor)  \n\nAYCE sushi with some Korean thrown in there?

It was a last minute decision to check out Rhythm Kitchen on a Friday night, especially since we drive by it all the time and have to wonder what it's like.\n\nWe walked in to an elegant foyer and for a moment, I felt a bit under dressed.  There were two hostesses manning the front, one of whom I had the impression was the owner or manager.  With no reservations, we were easily seated at a table right by the pianist.  (They just added the pianist on a regular basis.)  It was really nice inside the dining room, and rather busy.  Despite the upscale feeling, there's a very casual crowd inside which works out great.  You can have a nice dinner out without the stuffiness.  \n\nSince we were on a time limit, we ordered only entrees and waited for them to arrive.  In the meantime, a basket of hush puppies and one bread roll with sweet butter arrived at our table.  (We are a party of two, only one bread roll?)  Nonetheless, we enjoyed the piping hot hush puppies and the warm bread. \n\nThere was a bit of lag time as we waited for our food and I was under the impression that it felt like it was a bit understaffed.  It looked like there were three waiters, which had me concerned with how long it would take our food to come out since the wait staff definitely took their time with each customer (getting drink orders, getting apps started, explaining items on the menu, etc.).  It gave us a chance to enjoy the lovely music though.  \n\nOur food did arrive by someone else and the Husband chose Seafeast Platter \"Combination of catfish fillets, oysters, fried shrimp and cold boiled shrimp.\" ($17.79) It came with one side, and he chose a Baked Potato with his.  He appreciated that it was loaded with butter, sour cream, green onions, and cheese.  The deep fried catfish and oysters were pretty good, and not overly oily or fatty.  It had a good batter on it.  His platter also came with their chow chow relish.\n\nI chose the Grilled Cajun Scallops \"With andouille sausage.\" ($17.99)  It came with two sides, and I chose the Baked Potato and Sauteed Mushrooms.  The scallops were on a kabob stick (about 9 large scallops), along with sausage, bell peppers, and onions.  Rice and gravy sat underneath my protein.  The scallops were pretty good, not overcooked at all.  More on the rare side, which I prefer.  And the mushrooms were cooked very nicely too.  I pretty much devoured my dinner (as a customer noted from a nearby table).  This same customer also commented on how delicious her crab chowder and deep fried alligator was.  She even offered some to us!\n\nSince we were in a rush, I quickly asked our waiter for our check and let him know we had a baby waiting.  He seemed like he understood our urgency, but took the time to clear our table first.  (Yes, I know he was doing his job, but I think he missed the point that we needed to go and now!)\n\nThe manager/owner took the time to talk to us and let us know about the bar/lounge connected next door and their happy hour.  She also mentioned that they have banquet facilities upstairs and there's a live band that will be coming on a regular basis as well.  (I think there's a cover charge.)  She also mentioned joining their email list so we could find out what entertainment was going on.\n\nOverall, we both were pleasantly surprised and delighted with our experience at Rhythm Kitchen.  One would have a better experience if you can enjoy a leisurely dinner instead.  Yes, it might be a bit pricey depending on what you get, so it helps that they are in the Entertainment Book.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SqpICnZPgxUraMDNqu-YwA"}

We figure it was a bit of gamble, but was confident we'd be satisfied.  After putting in our order, the waitress asked us how we wanted our spice level and we chose medium.\n\n* Spicy Wild Mushroom Hot Pot ($11.95) - The first dish to arrive and it comes sizzling with a flame below it.

So they do have a steady following.\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with Hunan food.  It's just so full of flavor, spice, and kick.  Their food is far from bland.\n\nOur only downfall was not making this a group thing.  The more the merrier, and in this case that means more dishes to try and share!

Pastrami on Decatur, we were told that we need to visit the one on Tropicana.  Of course, this didn't take any persuading for the Husband who had his dinner planned out before he saw me.\n\nThis location is a bit bigger with a few tables inside the walk up counter, tables outside, and of course, their drive through.  Two people worked here when we went - one working the back and the other working the front.\n\nSticking with what they know best - pastrami, the Husband went for the Pastrami Burger \"A 1/4 lb burger topped with Sammy's famous pastrami, mustard, pickle & provolone.\" ($7.59)  He was also convinced to add a fried egg on top as well (99 cents)!  Since having their pastrami sandwich only a week ago, this burger is big but not quite as big as the sandwich.  But then again, it's loaded with hamburger meat, pastrami, and now a fried egg.  So, it's a serious burger.  He was digging it and ate it all up himself!\n\nI was sticking with their signature fries and again went for the Garlic Romano, this time a large for $4.99.  Their large size is HUGE compared to the medium at the other location. I have no idea why!  We easily finished the medium before, but we didn't stand a chance with the large here.  Yikes!\n\nWe also shared a large Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade ($3.99).  Originally I asked for a frozen lemonade, but the guy working the counter suggested the regular one would be better.\n\nAfter we put in our order, we took a seat outside to enjoy the spring evening and our food soon arrived.  The counter guy also came by to ask how we liked the food and even gave us refills on the lemonade.  Sweet!  He was definitely a friendly one and he knew more about when the place was going to be featured on the Food Network too.\n\nOf course, we didn't finish the fries but the Husband brought them home.  He said they tasted even better the next day after a few minutes in the toaster oven.  Lucky! \n\nThey also have gift certificates available at restaurant.com for this location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j3xNAQtY6nFLeE6p4TpJoQ"}

I crave the spice factor, the flavors that only Ethiopian food can give.  And this week I gave into that craving.\n\nWe've tried quite a few Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas, and decided to try a new one this time - Blue Nile.\n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was empty.  We weren't deterred because most Ethiopian restaurants are always empty when we choose to dine.  It's the timing!\n\nYou definitely have to pay attention when you're looking for this restaurant.  The outside is nothing to rave about, but it's surprisingly nice inside.  We had our choice of tables and the waiter asked if we were okay with the basketball game on.  We were and once he realized that the Husband was paying attention to the game, he asked if we wanted to move closer to the TV.  We declined but appreciated his offer.  (Note: No language barriers here!)\n\nWe now know what we want these days without needing to look at the menu.  Their menu is pretty short - only 13 items on there!\n\nWe chose the Vegetarian Combo \"A combination dish of pureed split lentil cooked with onion and hot pepper in zesty spicy sauce, green pepper, collared green sauteed with garlic and cooked cured cabbage, potato, and carrots.\" ($9.99) and Kitfo \"Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice...raw, medium, or well-done.\" ($10.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-nile-ethiopian-restaurant-las-vegas?select=u5U9roXHFQ1IWpfU1UGZJw#BSv57_OeogGrShN-lmwVMw\n\nThe Vegetarian Combo arrived first and we were starving, so we just dove right in.  We couldn't wait for the Kitfo to arrive although it did shortly after.  (It did seem like we had to wait a little longer than usual for our food...not sure if it's because we were famished or it actually took longer.)  The Husband commented that it looked like we got less food in the combo than other places and looking back at some of the other places we've eaten, I do have to agree.  However, the amount of kitfo we got was quite generous.  We had leftovers!\n\nThe waiter explained everything we got - which was actually Yellow Lentils, Chickpeas, Collared Greens, Red Lentils, Fresh Salad, Cured Cabbage, and String Beans.  (No potato or carrots as mentioned in the menu description.)  Each item was good, but I do believe that the lentils have been a bit more flavorful at other places.  The kitfo was super flavorful though!  We did ask for it to be medium and it was more medium rare, which we still ate.  It also came with a homemade spinach and cheese concoction to help with the heat.  I didn't really notice that much heat coming from any of the food, except when we chose to add the much needed hot red pepper seasoning.\n\nWe needed more water and injera bread, and did have to wait to be noticed first about needing those as opposed to it arriving before we were out.\n\nOverall, it was good.  There were some things better here than others and vice versa, but we'd come back. We usually never have leftovers, so that was a first.  I think I might be craving it again next week...where to next?\n\n3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RSBdMDQF1nYBj7NTUCdxHw"}

Sweet!\n\nThe Husband orders their Signature Item - the Classic Barbecue Baby Back Ribs (Half Rack) \"Our half-rack slow-cooked for hours then covered with our tangy barbecue sauce.\" It comes with two Signature sides - he chose the Baked Potato and Baked Mac 'n Cheese ($1 extra).

Generous portion! \n\nAnd of course, our nephew ordered from the Kids Menu (10 and under) -  Kids' Mac 'n Cheese Pasta, which came with your choice of beverage.  Being the great kid he is, he asked for milk with it!  The best part was when his order arrived, he asked if he could extra cheese.  I asked him from where and he mentioned that he saw shredded cheese over at the salad bar.  We asked the waitress and she brought over a little container of cheese for him and he was just so pleased!  As he devoured his favorite meal - he finished up his milk and asked for another!

(Didn't hurt that they had a gift certificate on restaurant.com either.)  We definitely were surprised with what we got.\n\nFirst off - Volcano Grill is a fast food Japanese restaurant.  Walking in, there's the counter and register right in front of you.  You put your order in and pay first, then grab your condiments and take a seat.  Our food was brought to us in to go containers despite the fact that we were 'dining in'.\n\n\"The Plate\" options include your choice of protein (filet mignon, shrimp, wild alaskan salmon, shredded crab, chicken breast, or vegetarian); choice of white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or lo mein; choice of cucumber salad or ginger dressing salad; and choice of grilled vegetables or 3 chicken gyozas.  Your price is determined by the protein choice.\n\nFor the two of us, we choice three plate options.\n\n* Filet Mignon Plate with Brown Rice, Grilled Vegetables, and Ginger Dressing Salad ($9.85) - The beef was tasty and the grilled veggies mostly consisted of napa cabbage.  \n\n* Shrimp Plate with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Generous with the shrimp and tasty too!  The gyozas were enjoyable as well.  The cucumber salad is a pickled salad.\n\n* Wild Alaskan Salmon with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Although it wasn't bad, the salmon was our least favorite.\n\nThey did get the orders mixed up a bit (wrong side or wrong salad with our protein choice) but we did get everything we wanted.  (Not a big deal since we were sharing, more of a concern if you're picking up for a bunch of different people.)  Although the price says $9.85, I think he may have rang us up for a higher price.  So double check.\n\nI also ordered two regular soft drinks ($1.49) but he rang us up for two large ones ($1.79).  Which wasn't a big deal since we were dining in and they have the cool iced tea machine and soda fountain to help yourself to.  \n\nIn the condiments section, they have a bunch of different 'special' sauce that you can help yourself to.  Ultimately, you don't need them, but they are nice to have.  (Hot Lava, Yum Yum, Ginger, Teriyaki, Spicy Teriyaki, Hot Magma, Sweet Garlic, Sweet Onion Chili, Japanese Salsa, and Spicy Miso)\n\nThey pride themselves on a menu that has nothing over ten dollars, which is true.  They also offer a cheaper \"The Bowl\" option, which comes with white rice and grilled vegetables. \n\nOverall, the food was good.  It's more of a lunch option, not some place you'd go out for dinner though.  As long as you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed.  This is far from a teppanyaki experience though! \n\n3.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "pPDVpf3daNYrV15_qiUKQA"}

And of course, we can't ignore the gigantic bowl for $30 (if you can't finish it in the allocated time).  At a first glance, I would say it's a bit pricier here for standard pho.  The better value is to go for the large pho portions, and then it's not as expensive.  (I think it's probably a better value for two people to share a large, but the waitress strongly discourages sharing pho since it changes the temperature of the soup, etc. etc.)\n\nThe Husband went for the $10 large bowl of oxtail soup pho.  It's a pretty big bowl with lots of oxtail meat present, so I think he definitely got his bang for his buck.  Whereas I went for one of the regular pho bowls, size small for $7, and it was just okay.  The meat portions are on the smaller end. I'm used to seeing larger cuts of rare beef, but that wasn't the case here.  Also, my soup was just warm and the Husband concurred the same about his broth.\n\nI also got to try two variations of their spring rolls - the shrimp and pork ones.  I liked the shrimp ones better since they grilled the shrimp prior to putting it in the wrapper.  The pork ones were just okay.\n\nThe waitress was a bit anxious with trying to figure out how many people were going to compete, and it was pretty early on when we told her it was going to be four.  She said the cook needed to know how much meat to cut up.  Everyone wanted rare beef only in their pho, and she checked with the kitchen to make sure they could do this and they said yes.  I did ask her if she could serve the competitors first since they had 87 minutes to eat, and the rest of us could get our food last.  In the end, everyone else got their food and finished it long before the four competitors even saw their bowl of pho.  This was definitely not an efficient use of time at all and I think it also affected those who were competing. \n\nWhen the challenge bowls of pho did arrive, it definitely looked like it was more noodles than beef.  It's supposed to be 1.5 pounds of beef, 1.5 pounds of noodles, and broth.  The broth isn't such a high priority to finish since she said that by the end, there's usually not that much broth left anyway.  It was super hot when it arrived too.  (Guess that's where all the hot broth went!)  James A. came really close to finishing and he even brought his leftovers home (and finished them).  Word is that him and Robert R. might go for round two!   \n\nPho 87 is a pretty large restaurant from the other Vietnamese restaurants in town, and a bit fancier.  There's a whole set up in the back that makes you wonder if they offer some kind of lunch buffet since they have those self service hot stations.\n\nService definitely makes for an 'interesting' and 'entertaining' experience.  The waitress assigned to us definitely has comments coming from left field that probably are not the most politically correct.  She spent a lot of time discouraging us from participating in the challenge in the beginning, then she encouraged the females in our group to 'give a show' to encourage our male friends who were competing...comments about flashing and fake boobs were included.\n\nIf you do complete the Pho 87 Challenge, your bowl of pho is free, as well as the bowl.  And she said they'll put your face on a billboard!  She said no one in Las Vegas has completed their challenge yet, but a few from Los Angeles has at their other location.  (Apparently she really wants a \" white boy\" on the billboard!)\n\nIt's hard opening yet another pho restaurant in Las Vegas.  Props to them for creating a hook that will bring the customers in.

They really don't like giving out water.  On more than one occasion, I had to ask more than once for a glass of water.

Thank you Yelp for sending me their way!\n\nBelly Bliss is a combination of things - a boutique store for mamas-to-be (and future dads), a spa, and offers classes and groups that are related to pregnancy and babies.\n\nRecently, I went specifically to experience their spa services.  Taking advantage of their seasonal specials, I got the Joyful Package for $170.  It consisted of a 60 minute \"Girls Getaway\" massage and a 90 minute signature \"Body in Balance\" facial treatment.  Joann M. was my massage therapist and Margo S. was my aesthetician.  Because this place specializes in working with pregnant woman, they make every attempt to make sure that you are comfortable during all your treatments.  Tables easily adjust for the head and body and plenty of pillows and supports are available for your comfort.  Both were professional and friendly and you get the feeling they both really enjoy working with all their pregnant clients. (Margo told me to come back again and bring the baby!)  Sure, there are plenty of spas in town that offer prenatal massage, but you end up paying an upcharge to use their facilities.  When in actuality, most pregnant women are discouraged from using the jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc.  So you end up feeling a bit short changed when all you wanted was some personal body work done.  Belly Bliss gives you just that without all the frills.  They only have a few treatments rooms available, so it shouldn't be crowded when you go.\n\nOnce your treatment is done, you can help yourself to their little snack bar where you can fill a take out box full of pretzels, goldfish crackers, lollipops, and raisins.  Plenty of spa water and apples are available too.\n\nGetting treatments done on Tuesdays also gives you 10% off your spa services!  Sweet!  Apparently, free eyebrow waxes and foot massages are available on Tuesdays as well.  Call ahead to confirm and make reservations! \n\nYou can't help but take a look through their store on your way out.  So many cool and useful items are available for you to check out and purchase.  It can be a bit dangerous actually!\n\nBelly Bliss is located on the 2nd floor of the Desert Perinatal Associates office, so doctors are only a few steps away if you're really concerned about anything.\n\nClasses include Breastfeeding, Yoga (Pre and Postnatal), Newborn Care and Immunization, Baby Massage, How to Select a Childcare Facility, and Childbirth Education.  Medela breast pumps are available for rental too! They also have party rental space if you want to plan a baby shower or private party at their facility.\n\nGift certificates are available and any pregnant girl would be happy to receive a service from Belly Bliss!  Husbands, boyfriends, fathers, partners, friends - check this place out and give a great gift for a future mama! \n\nI've been looking over their other spa services and can't wait to book another!", "type": "review", "business_id": "7L1lpw6r0BXPOKRb90WlaQ"}

The staff were very welcoming as we entered after parking in the private lot in the back.  (This way you don't have to walk through the casino and hotel to get here.)\n\nArriving early, we both settled in at our respective lounge areas, reading a magazine and grabbing a cup of tea.  When the attendants came for us, they brought us to the couples room for our treatments.  The room was on the same level as the pool, but hidden away.  It was a very nice size room and I only wish we had more treatments that would have allowed us to use the bathtub and outdoor shower.\n\nWe both had the Stone Massage \"This light-pressure therapy combines traditional Swedish massage with use of warm, polished basalt stones strategically  placed on the body to promote circulation, boost the immune system and soften skin.\" for 80 minutes of pure bliss.  It was just lovely.  Our two therapists had slightly different techniques, but we both left very pleased with our treatments.\n\nWe had initially wanted their Shirodhara Hot Stone Massage and Shirodhara Scalp Experience, but were told when booking that they are still training the therapists in these types of techniques.  We were a bit bummed about that.\n\nAfter our treatments were finished, we sat outside by the spa pool and lazed around on a cabana.  We also ordered lunch (portabello mushroom burger and mini chili cheese hot dogs) along with some pricey alcoholic drinks.  We swam in the lap pool, sat in the steam room, jacuzzied, and eventually headed back downstairs to the spa.\n\nWe then spent time in the co-ed areas, which included a lounge room, an outdoor area, and a jacuzzi.  This is one of the best things about The Spa at Green Valley Ranch Resort - their coed areas.  Yes, some people could care less about this stuff, but for us, we were looking for areas where we could spend time together and this spa offered those spaces.\n\nThere is a co-ed fitness center available if you're so inclined too.\n\nBack in our own locker rooms, I enjoyed the jacuzzi, the steam room, and the lounge. I even tried out this machine that vibrated my body that targeted different regions.\n\nWhen we were done, we felt quite relaxed.  It was a good day for us.  Yes, it can get a bit pricey, so check out their website for rotating promotions going on.  When we went, it was Buy One, Get One Free.  So that was a nice perk.  \n\nNevada residents get 30% treatments right now too.\n\n4.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "iDVVyTPcZq1UCJSw_xpeWQ"}

We sat down a little after 7 pm and each took a look at the spread before us.\n\nThere seemed to be a good amount of banchan to choose from, including white rice and purple rice.  Quite a selection of meats to choose from as well.  Their cooked items were okay - ranging from dumplings, fish, and tempura.  Their dessert selection though is something to cry about - jello, canned peaches, fresh watermelon and honeydew, old sesame balls, and deep-fried pineapple chunks.\n\nPrice for adults on weekends: $19.95\n\nI do have to agree with other comments regarding the staff hounding you.  The managers would come by our table all the time (we were seated close to the register), and take a survey of the restaurant.  It made me wonder if they were watching how much we were eating.  At one point, the waitress put the bill on our table and I was a bit shocked.  I said \"Is there a time limit?\" under my breath, but she then told us to take our time.  (Take our time eating or take our time paying the bill?)  Either way, getting your bill during our meal is a bad sign.  Don't do it.  And yes, we also experience the older Korean owner too.  I guess I said something out loud about not having any lettuce, and a little green salad showed up at my table.  Weird.  \n\nService is okay - drinks come immediately, and they also help with cooking your meat too.

(This was going to be a bit tricky since I'm on an egg-free diet.)  Nonetheless, our Groupon allowed us some flexibility with our choices in dinner which helped a lot.\n\nAfter we put in our order, we started munching on the Parmesan cheese crisps and could not get enough of them!  They were really yummy!\n\nWe started off with the Beignet of Calamari \"Tempura Fried, Pickled Peppers & Tartar Sauce\"  ($12).  Usually calamari is pretty average and not much can set it apart from the rest.  But for some reason, their version is pretty good!  The accompanying pickles were a nice contrast and the tartar dipping sauce had a little extra that made it stand out.  We were pleasantly surprised!\n\nI went with the Seared Scallops \"Roasted Heirloom Potato, House Cured Lardons, Onion Confit & Arugula Salad with Smoked Corn Cream\" ($27) because I just love a good scallop - raw or seared!  They were three super tasty pieces of shellfish although I thought the arugula sald was going to be raw.  (It's more of a cooked salad.)  I did request that the corn cream not be included in my dish, but unfortunately it was.  So they had to remake the dish.  (It took me awhile to flag down our waiter to tell him the error.)\n\nThe Husband ordered the Bone In Ribeye Steak 'Bearnaise Sauce\" ($44) and sadly, this fell short in a big way.  First off, he requested rare and it came out more medium.  Plus, it was missing a major flavor component.   I'm not sure if they don't season the beef because it comes with a bearnaise sauce, but it just was very bland.  We didn't send it back since it took so long for me to wave down the waiter the first time and the Husband was starving at this point!\n\nDessert is where I lost the most - everything had some form of egg in it except the  Homemade Sorbets ($9).  They were out of coconut, which was a real bummer.  So we ended up with a scoop of mango, peach, and mixed berry.  The mango was the best one of the bunch.\n\nThe service was just okay, they were nice and professional but just not as attentive as we had hoped or expected.  Perhaps it's because they seated us in the corner of the dining room, so we didn't get a lot of staff passing by.  I felt ridiculous waving my arms and saying \"Excuse Me!\" to catch the staff's attention. \n\nOverall, Garfield's Restaurant was just an okay experience for us.

But leave it to an advertisement selling their newest addition to the menu \"AYCE Korean BBQ\" to have us coming through their doors.\n\nOnce you get passed the boring facade, you walk into a large restaurant establishment with a bar to the right, sushi bar in the middle, tables to the left, and bbq tables on the further left\n\nThe Husband wanted AYCE Korean BBQ, and there's only one way he can get it - if I order it with him.  (It's offered to parties of two or more doing AYCE only.)\n\nAdult prices: $19.95\nKid prices: 8 years old and younger: $12.95\n\nA little banchan starts your Korean meal - Korean pancake, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, and potato. Not much here.\n\nAs the waitress was getting our table set up, I asked her if I'm supposed to go ahead and tell her what I want.  She mentioned something about them usually bringing everything out, unless I have a preference.  We definitely did have a preference because we didn't quite want it all!\n\nThere are about seven different appetizers to choose from, we went with:\n\n* Garlic Edamame \"Soy bean with spicy garlic sauce)\n* Gyoza (Deep fried dumpling)\n* Chicken Wing (Spicy marinated)\n\nThe kitchen list has about six items, and we got:\n\n* Tonkatsu (Deep fried breaded pork)\n* Vegetable Tempura (Assorted vegetable deep fried)\n* Kake Udon (Thick noodles soup with fried tofu, fish cake, seaweed)\n* Fried Rice (Vegetable)\n\nFrom the Korean BBQ list of four items:\n\n* Galbi (Angus marinated BBQ beef ribs)\n* Samgyubsal (Pork belly)\n(Our waitress did all the cooking for us here, so that was nice.)\n\nFrom the Classic Rolls list of seven items:\n\n* Salmon Skin Roll (grilled salmon skin)\n* Spicy Tuna Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber)\n\nFor dessert, you get only one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream.\n\nThe staff really didn't want our fellow diners to not do AYCE with us, but we told them otherwise.  The MIL and her companion chose to order off their regular Japanese menu.  They both had the Combination Dinner Special which includes salad, rice, miso soup, gyoza, and two items from their list for $13.50.  (It's $15.50 if you want three items.)  She went for the tonkatsu and miso saba, while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura.  However, we think he got the short end of the stick because there were only two pieces of shrimp and the rest were veggies.  (In retrospect, he would have done the Shrimp Tempura Entree dinner for $12.90 and gotten 6 pieces of shrimp instead.)  What a bummer!  They also got what looked like a half order of a CA roll with their meal.\n\nService was good for the latter part.  Our initial waitress was a bit spacey, until we moved into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier.  \n\nIt was only a Tuesday night, but they had a steady stream of customers - some sitting at the tables, another sitting at the AYCE bbq section, and more sitting at the sushi bar.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the sushi menu is pretty long.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad for AYCE.  Sure, we've had a better selection for a fraction of the price, but it'll have to do for the southwest area for now.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off over on Spring Mountain.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DUDX6e_9RPEdyvyJ88w4sA"}

The red-yellow-green signage illuminates the restaurant's name and it's cuisine.\n\nWalking in, this was probably one of the nicest Ethiopian restaurants in town.  The modern furniture immediately sets the tone, along with a bar on the right and a small stage area in the back.\n\nOn a Saturday night, we were the only customers.  We weren't concerned though because our previous experiences at other Ethiopian restaurants have always left us in the minority.\n\nQueen of Sheba's menu is very limited - with only 15 items.  Of course, we knew exactly what we wanted and they definitely had it.\n\n#4. Kitfo \"Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice.\" ($8.99)  We made a point of saying we wanted it raw, and again, the eyebrows were raised.  And when it arrived, it was slightly warmed and tasted just divine.  The portion was quite generous and we agreed, this was probably the best kitfo we've had so far! \n\n#13. Vegetarian Combo \"A combination of split lentil peas, cabbage and potatoes/carrots and fresh salad.\" ($8.99)  It arrived with green and red lentils, yellow beans, steamed cabbage, and string beans.  The waitress asked if we wanted cheese, which we definitely did, and we also asked for the red chili powder.  There wasn't any 'fresh salad', but we could care less because their red and green lentils were so good here.  They had good spices mixed in, and we were loving it. The yellow beans were really good too.  The string beans and steamed cabbage are okay, as they were the same as the other restaurants.  We agreed that they do their legumes really well here, and probably would just order a plate of the red lentils on its own, or even the green lentils or yellow beans.\n\nService was fine - one waitress who took care of us the whole time.  She was pleasant, but we had some language barriers about ordering water which eventually worked itself out.  She came by to check on us and brought out more injera when she saw we were getting low.  The bathrooms could use a bit of a cleanup, the men's room smelled like urine and the women's room had graffiti and lacked toilet paper and paper towels.  \n\nOverall, Queen of Sheba is one of our fave Ethiopian restaurants of the five we tried.  With their limited menu, it may be challenging for newbies.  But they offer the staples we like, and we'll probably return when we crave raw beef!\n\nPer their website, they offer live reggae on Friday nights.", "type": "review", "business_id": "75n7FVIObWM3iMf95duQOw"}

There aren't that many options for tapas in Las Vegas beyond the two Firefly locations.\n\nBarcelona Tapas and Bar gives us one other place to consider when you're craving small bites.\n\nLocated in a busy strip mall where locals frequent, this restaurant had a few customers by the bar and dining when we walked in on a weekday night.\n\nI had a few things in mind immediately based on previous yelpers, so we got to ordering.  We munched on complimentary bread and spreads while we waited for our orders to arrive.\n\n* Beef Carpaccio \"Thin sliced of tender tails drizzle with balsamic vinaigrette, truffle oil, tapenade, and fried onions\" ($8) - I love beef carpaccio...when it's done right.  Yelpers raved about their version and sadly, we couldn't quite see why.  It's more like cured beef than raw beef, which is what we were expecting.  Not quite like beef jerky, but not delicate like what we're familiar with.  It was also covered with large shavings of cheese, which was not mentioned.   Not sure if this was to cover up the beef or enhance the taste.\n\n* Pastelillos de pollo (Chicken Cakes) \"Chopped chicken, green and red onions, red pepper, chopped cilantro, black bean and corn salsa molded together and grilled served with gribiche.\" ($5.50) - Something a bit unusual that you don't see on every menu.  It's a bit misleading in its description since we were expecting all the ingredients to be 'molded together' to create a corn cake.  In actuality, the black bean and corn salsa are on the side of the corn cake.  Nonetheless, it was quite tasty with the accompanying egg sauce.  And it is only one corn cake.\n\n* Merguez Lamb Sausage \"Served with couscous, and roasted pepper tomato sauce and a Merlot wine reduction sauce.\" ($7.50) - There was a distinctive lamb taste to it, and what I'm sure was some liver blended into the mixture.  The Husband isn't a fan of most livers so he was very aware of the funny taste to it.  Comes two in an order.\n\n* Pan Fried Dates \"Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles.\" ($5.50) - Anything wrapped in bacon usually can't go wrong, and dates mix perfectly with bacon in this case too.  Comes five in an order.\n\n* Boquerones (White Anchovies) \"Toasted French bread with a spicy aioli topped with sweet white anchovies and balsamic reduction sauce.\" ($5.50) - Anchovies were something we enjoyed everyday when we were in Spain, but we didn't know what took so long for this one order to come out.  The bread could have been toasted just a bit longer.  \n\n* Lomo a la parrilla (Petite Filet) \"Mashed potato, mushroom and Merlot sauce.\" ($8.50) - Our final order, which we put in at the last minute.  It took a bit too long, and the waiter did come by to say it was coming out soon.  (It still took longer after that.  I can only assume that our order got stuck behind the larger parties that had come in after us.)  Another one of those dishes I ordered based on raving reviews, and sadly, it did disappoint.  We ordered it rare and although the center was pink, the outside was grilled a bit too long and thus hard.  \n\nWe were impressed by how busy it got for a weekday night - and Barcelona Tapas & Bar does cater to families with plenty of large tables, high chairs, and a diaper changing station in the restroom.  Right now they are offering an introductory and temporary offer where kids eat free on Sundays through Tuesdays from 4 pm to 8 pm, for those 10 and under only and with a purchase of an adult entree.\n\nService was okay - we asked our waitress for another set of silverware and she completely forgot about it.  (Immediately after we asked her, she went to sit a  party that arrived and never came back.)  We also had to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  The man who sat us did ask us how we had heard about them.  We also noticed the chef come by our table four different times to look at what we were eating, but never actually said anything to us.  \n\nSpecials include:\nMondays: Half off bottles of wine.\nTuesdays: Half off their homemade Sangria.\nWednesdays: Half off Martinis.\nThursdays: Half off Mojitos.\nFridays: Half off all their tapas from 4 pm to 6 pm\nSaturdays: Ladies Night with Half off all House drinks, wines and beer from 10 pm to 12 am.  Live music.\nKaraoke everyday (except Fridays and Saturdays) and tapas are half off after 10 pm.\n\nAccording to their website, they are open for lunch now - but their opening hours are still posted as opening at 4 pm.\n\nThere are coupons everywhere for them - restaurant.com, local newspaper, and online.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw"}

Apparently, they opened up this week and Philip T. was so kind to remind us that it had finally opened.\n\nIt's what I would call Korean barbecue meets the finer end of Japanese quality meat.  Yakiniku means \"grilling meat\" and it's hard to separate the two from just regular good ole fashion Korean BBQ.\n\nI was pretty excited when I walked in the restaurant - clean lines, large tables with exhaust chimneys for grilling, and a thermometer announcing the beer was 29 degrees.\n\nHowever, when I saw the menu, I was disappointed.  It was very simple and basic.  I was a bit turned off.  But since we were there already, I just had to try it.  The waitresses also gave us two dipping sauces - a Japanese soy sauce with mirin and another one I can't remember.\n\n* Pork Toro ($6.75) - Twelve pieces of fatty pork sprinkled with salt and pepper.  We threw them on the grill and yes, they were amazingly delicious and fatty.\n\n* Prime Beef Tongue ($9.25) - Seven pieces of fresh beef tongue and went quite nicely with the lemon juice and sesame oil/salt concoction.\n\n* Ribeye ($7.75) - Six or seven pieces of beef, along with three pieces of veggies.  Also, very tasty and fresh.\n\nInitially, the prices don't seem too bad.  But I knew we were hungry and if were going to stick around, the bill would have been costly.  I thought we would be able to enjoy a nice meaty dinner, but seeing the direction of the costs, it looked like it would be a pricey meat dinner.  I don't really like how everything is a la carte - kimchee, garlic, lettuce, rice, etc.  With all the Korean restaurants in town, you get used to getting all that other stuff included.\n\nAnd like john h.'s friend, our friend thought some of the waitresses were cute, but that's his fever.\n\nService was good, a bit over efficient this first week of business.  We had at least three different girls ask if we were ready to order, and we were not.  I think they are just trying to be out there, but it can get suffocating.\n\nThe exhaust doesn't work that great because tears were welling up from all the smoke coming from our grill. \n\nOverall, I think it would be good for a snack or light meal, but not for a hearty meal with friends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pzj5ow6I8eQI2iGnFziGLw"}

As we park the car, we notice there aren't too many other cars parked out front.  Hmmm...As we open the door, what a shock to see!  The place was packed full of Indians!  This was a great sign! \n\nI wasn't sure if there was a wait with all the people standing around of if there was a private party.  With no one to greet us at the front, the Husband goes in search of an empty table.  He finds one last table at the far back and after checking with a waiter, I get the affirmative wave.  I tell him to start first on the buffet line.  Meanwhile, I ask a waiter for some utensils.\n\nWhen the waiter brings over our water, he apologizes as a tour group had just arrived, which explains all the craziness.  Nonetheless, an Indian tour group stops at Namaste in Commercial Center, of all places, for their lunch en route is still a good sign!\n\nMy turn at the buffet line!  Now, I'm no expert on Indian buffets as I've been to only a couple.  But I think the spread was pretty good for $8.99!\n\nMy favorite was the Vegetable Korma \"Vegetable cooked in creamy cashew nut gravy finished with almond and garnished with coriander and cream.\"  This was good on rice or the hot naan \"unleavened white bread\" they provided.  I also liked the sauce from the Chicken Tikka Masala \"Tender pieces of chicken breast roasted in homemade creamy tomato,\" however, we both found the chicken pieces itself to be dry.  I also liked the Allo Jerra, which were ultimately potatoes.\n\nThe Husband was loving the Saag Paneer \"Spinach cooked with homemade cheese\" and the Goat Curry.  \n\nOther items on the buffet line were Pakara, a fried veggie, Cholle Masala, a dish with chickpeas; and a Cabbage Masala.  Something that was both new to us was the Uttapam, a thick pancake with a sour-like taste that was topped with a bit of tomato and onion.  Traditionally it's made from rice that has been fermented, which explains it's tangy taste.\n\nFinishing off the meal was the Kheer, \"Traditional Indian rice pudding with nuts, flavored with cardamon and rose.\"\n\nAt one point, I helped myself to the water pitcher.  (I wasn't sure if this was self serve since there were about four water pitchers right next to where we were sitting and the place was so crowded.  They did end up refilling my glass the next 4-5 times though.)  The waiters were pretty friendly to us once the crowd got settled in more and started clearing out.  They were quick to clear out our dirty dishes and refill the water glasses.\n\nNamaste also has a simple, but pleasant decor with its mango painted walls, which I'm sure makes one crave a mango lassi.\n\nOverall, definitely not a bad choice for an Indian buffet.  I was so stuffed from that meal that I didn't eat again until 10 pm that night! I don't know if it's always this busy on Sundays though, so keep that in mind!", "type": "review", "business_id": "dwJKxmnu0jZ2tQDuqJ_Zsw"}

Sure, they were large, but they were also dried out.  There was no head juice to suck out at all.  When you break the head off, you can tell there's something wrong immediately.  And the sauce in the bottom of the bowl is this watered down concoction of something or other.  I don't think it's as fresh as they say it is, the ones in the tank are just for show I think!    \n\nThe staff were friendly, and really anxious to refill our beverages.

The creamy sauce was flavorful and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly.  The fresh greens on top also brightened the dish, although it does get a bit heavy with the noodles resting on the bottom.  Nonetheless, I was scooping up the sauce and putting it on my rice!\n\n* Spaghetti \"TARAKO\" ($10.75) - This was described as \"Japanese No. 1 Traditional Pasta\", so I figured it would be a good representation of what they served.  Again, the spaghetti was cooked perfectly and a nice array of things in it.  If you look up 'tarako' online, it means \"salted cod fish roe\" which explains the salty fish taste (in a good way) in the dish.  We were confused because although we knew the other dish was the anchovy one, the saltiness fish taste gave us the impression this was the anchovy one.\n\n* \"KUROBUTA\" Pork with Amatriciana Sauce ($14.50) - Sliced pork with a sweet tomato-based pork, it was tasty and a bit different.  It also came with a cold noodle salad that was just delicious and reminded me of a cold noodle salad that I had at a San Francisco-based Japanese restaurant that has long since closed.  As this was considered an entree dish, you get bread or steamed white rice with it.\n\nWe did try ordering the \"Grilled Scallop with Tomato and Genovese Sauce\" but they were out of it.  \n\nService was fine - there was one waitress on a Saturday evening and it was a bit slow.  She was as polite as you would expect from a Japanese restaurant.\n\nI like this place.  It's different and definitely has me curious about their other dishes.  Our friend wasn't as impressed and proclaimed he could make the spaghetti a lot better at home.  Nonetheless, the Husband and I will probably be back to see what else we can try.

She'll go over each item and this is where you should really pay attention.  We found the best dishes to come off this very board!  (A previous highlight has been their Scallop, Shrimp, Garlic Anchovy Cream Spaghetti.)\n\nThis time we started off with the Parma Prosciutto Mushroom Salad ($9.75).  I now recall there not being any mushroom on this salad at all.  There was definitely the prosciutto on the greens with a drizzling of extra virgin oil oil, salt and pepper, and a fresh squeeze of lemon juice.  It was decent, but now has me wondering about the mushrooms.\n\nThe Husband ordered the Vongole Spaghetti with Red Sauce ($16), which is ultimately pasta with clams.  They offered this dish with a red or white wine sauce and it came off the daily specials board.\n\nThe real winner was my choice of the Japanese Pumpkin and Chicken Cream Sauce ($15), which also came off the daily specials board.  What can I say, they really know how to do their cream sauces here.  It's so good, so fatty, and just done so well!  Yum!  And I'm usually not the biggest fan of chicken in my dishes, but there was something so tender and perfectly cooked about the poultry in this dish.  I was immediately impressed, and the Husband was equally surprised at how tender those little morsels were.  I can safely say their cream sauces just wow me to no end! \n\nService - the waitresses are really nice and do their job, including bringing us extra dishes so we could share and things like that.\n\nThings to note: soft drinks are by the bottle, they don't come from a soda machine.  And don't forget your gift certificate from restaurant.com!  \n\nLike I said -  stick to their daily specials board or other unique entrees and leave the sushi and typical stuff for your regular Japanese restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sJg0ELnsDeuFUJcVubF98g"}

Not only does Dad's Grilled Cheese serve up these sandwiches, but their dinner menus offer up mac and cheese specials.\n\n* The Godfather \"Thin cut salami drowned in a layer of melted mozzarella and provolone with peppercinis, on butter-glazed grilled Italian bread.\" ($5.99) - This was the Husband's choice and it had good flavor and lots of oozing cheese in it.  A decent choice for getting a taste of what Dad's Grilled Cheese is all about.  Our friend paid the two dollar extra for the GrandDad on this sandwich, which meant it was on a grilled French bread hoagie and more cheese and meat.  I'm not sure if it was worth a $8 sandwich.  \n\n* The Doctor \"Colby Jack cheese melted over tuna salad nested on grilled wheat bread.\" ($4.69) - This was my choice, and probably not the best thing to try here.  It's a very standard tuna salad mix, so the sandwich is definitely lacking.  I wasn't too impressed.  It definitely needed some kick - seasoning or something.\n\nService - once you put your order in, the staff brings your items to your table.  They also came by to check up on us and to clear the empty baskets.  So, it's almost full service except for the part where you order at the counter.  And you get a Hershey's kiss with your sandwich order too.\n\nOverall, we thought Dad's Grilled Cheese is a wonderful concept but we weren't as excited about our sandwiches as we hoped to be.  We found it to be a bit pricey for what you're getting, especially since they only opened in December and were considerably cheaper then.  Nonetheless, you have to love that they are bringing back grilled cheese sandwiches and mac and cheese dinners.\n\nSidenote: Their 4:30 pm to 7:30 pm mac and cheese dinner specials include a $4.99 child's portion for those 12 and under.

It looks like they spent a few more dollars on the furniture.  They also have an open kitchen atmosphere, so you can actually take a peak of how things are being made.  This is a good sign to me since a restaurant who is willing to show off their kitchen must be confident of it!\n\nStarted off with #4. Cha Gio \" 4 Vietnamese fried eggrolls\" ($5.50).  I like restaurants that give you the greens so you can wrap your eggroll up.  Plenty of lettuce, mint, and the other stuff to make it quite complete.  It did take awhile to come out, I barely had a chance to wrap one up when our main entrees arrived.  The Husband said he could see that they were pan-frying it, which could explain why it took longer.  As a result though, it stayed hot longer since I had put the egg roll down to work on my pho and it was still quite hot when I got around to it.\n\nI went for the standard #11. Pho Dac Biet \"Special combo with rare slices of steak, well done brisket, flank, tendon, tripe and beef balls with rice noodle. \" (Small $5.95) The Husband said the broth tasted more 'perfumey' than other places.  I just noticed that I only got one piece of beef ball in my soup.\n\nThe Husband wanted his staple - #28. Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho \"Beef stew with egg noodle\" ($6.50) but they were out of it that evening.  He settled on #32. Com Ga Hai Nam \"Hai Nam style chicken served with seasonal rice\" ($7.50), which is something I usually get.  First off, it definitely looked (and tasted) a lot better than Pho Little Saigon's and Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant's versions.  They give you a lot of rice with this dish, perhaps too much since you end up eating it all. It was decent, but I've had better.  (Then again, it's always hard to compare this dish when you've had it homemade!  But I'll keep looking nonetheless.)\n\nOverall, Pho Village was a good experience overall.

I was more excited about the curry and coconut milk than the beef part.  The sauce was definitely tasty on the white rice, but the beef was a bit heavy.  It made for great leftovers (with a bit of peanut sauce) says the Husband.\n\nWhereas he chose the L-14 BBQ Pork Sate Lunch Special \"Marinated pork grilled on a bamboo skewer, served with peanut sauce, cucumber sauce, and fried rice.\" ($6.50).  He usually goes for the Beef Sate, but it's not offered here during the lunch special.  Nonetheless, we both really like it and I found myself nibbling more his protein than mine.

And what is for sale then?  Hawaiian food - plate lunches, desserts, poke, etc.\n\nWe walked in hesitantly, not sure what to expect.  Four guys were hanging out around a table and one of them got up and greeted us.  He headed to the counter and offered us a \"long john\" because, as he said, we looked hungry and it looked like we couldn't make a proper decision on what to order if we were hungry.  I sheepishly accepted this \"long john\" and bit into a lovely pastry filled with sweet egg custard cream.  Yum.  The Husband sunk his teeth into his own \"long john\" and we looked over the lunch menu posted on the dry erase board.\n\n* Chicken Katsu Plate Lunch ($8.25) - It came with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad.

Dennis, the owner, sat down to chat with us and he is super friendly.  Another regular also chatted with us too while we enjoyed our lunch.

So I definitely appreciate that you cannot light up anywhere in this restaurant.\n\nDuring football season, happy hour is in full swing which means discounted food and drinks.

What makes this an izakaya?  Ultimately, it's a Japanese establishment that serves food to complement drinks.  The food usually served are small bites, similar to tapas.  But what makes SHIN more unique in Vegas is that they have a long list of yakitori items!  And that means various goodies served up on skewers and put on the grill.  And their specialty is Okinawan-style food as well!\n\nThis restaurant has taken up the former space of Sushi Hana - therefore there are two private tatami rooms, a counter, and quite a few tables.\n\nThere was a modest group of diners on a Monday evening, and our luck was that we walked in during happy hour!

It's buttery slices rested on a bed of seaweed with delicious ponzu sauce.  Always a favorite.\n\n* Wagyu Harami ($4.75) - A tasty beef skewer that was juicy and tasty - we ordered two more!\n\n* Tebichi Soba \"Okinawan Style Noodle in Soup topped with Pork Feet\" ($7.50) - This was probably the one disappointing dish we had that evening.  When ordering, I asked the waitress if she recommended this dish or the Grilled Pork Feet.  She liked this one better, so we got it.  It had only one piece of pig's feet, green onions, and noodles.  It lacked taste.  In the picture, it actually looked like there were a few pieces of feet and a different style noodle.  In retrospect, we definitely should have gone with the grilled feet instead.\n\n* Chicken Thigh with Spicy Mayo ($2.45) - Tender pieces of chicken thigh with a drizzle of spicy mayo, sounds good and tastes good!\n\n* Smelt Fish ($2.75) - Also known as shishamo, and comes two in this order.  A squeeze of lemon and a light sprinkling of salt makes this grilled fish full of eggs just burst into your mouth.\n\n* Quail Eggs ($2.25)  - One skewer consists of three eggs and what we love about this dish is that the egg yolk is smooth and creamy inside.  Makes you want to make it at home.\n\n* Chicken Skin ($2) - Who doesn't love some grilled chicken skin?  The fattiness is something you just can't say no to.\n\nWe'll have to come back to try their shark cartilage, salmon carpaccio, miso cream cheese, deep fried octopus balls, deep fried tofu, stingray fin, pork belly, and honey toast.\n\nService was good - our waitresses kept our tea and water filled all the time without request, something I definitely appreciate.\n\nWe also noticed that the majority of customers and all of the staff (from what we could see) were Japanese, as in Japanese-speaking too.

Now I've had it at quite a few places and it's just yum!  It is a bit slimy and takes some getting used to, but I love this slippery goodness.\n\n* Rafutei (Simmered Pork Belly Okinawan Style) ($5.75) - Fatty chunks of pork belly with just a tad of hot mustard for some eat and that means good stuff all around!  It just melts in your mouth!\n\n* Okinawan Yaki Soba (Okinawan Style Fried Noodle) ($7.50) - This was a surprisingly yummy dish - red pickled ginger slices, bonito flakes, and chunks of meat mixed in with the noodles and vegetables gave this dish a nice taste.\n\n* Agedashi Tofu ($5.50) - Always a favorite of mine and they didn't disappoint here at SHIN.\n\nWe did order the quail eggs again and we just love how the hot yolk just melts in your mouth.

You can't help but notice their truck as they go sliding on through!  It's completely painted brightly with cartoon-like images.\n\nMy first experience with them was after the Las Vegas AIDS Walk where we had the Slider Truck pretty much to ourselves.  There was no wait really to put in our order, so that was definitely something we appreciated.  At the time, they were still experimenting with different burgers, so we only had a few to choose from.\n\nOne thing we did like from the start was the Pep Pep, which has sauteed onions, crisp bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato, melted cheese on top of a juicy patty along with their super sauce.\n\nThey also had the Pulled Porkie during that time, which has layers of pork on top of the toasted buns.  \n\nWe also tried the Barbie had cheese and bacon over the burger, along with plenty of barbecue sauce.\n\nFor the price you pay, there is definitely a lot of meat in between those two buns and it's a moist burger too.  We've paid more for a lot less - quantity and taste-wise, so this was a welcome addition to Vegas.\n\nOur next experience was on a Friday night and long lines were known to be found where the Slider Truck was.  In this case, there was indeed a line, but it was really the people gathering and waiting for their burgers.  It was a good 45 minutes before we got our burgers.  Ric came out from the truck to apologize for the long wait and some kid piped up, \"It's worth the wait!\"  That pretty much sums it up!\n\nOverall, we love the Slider Truck and the idea behind it.  Sure, waiting 45 minutes for a burger brings the wait for truck food to a whole new level.  We'll keep our eyes out for this truck, but we'll have to watch our clock too at the same time.  We definitely want to see Ric and his crew do well.  Owners who care about their customers and are genuinely excited about what they are doing is something we should all support!", "type": "review", "business_id": "LnCbpxipUrA165zvfaePGw"}

I've climbed the little trek up to Exploration Peak for a view of the southwest area.  A few times the Husband has gone for a run up there.  One summer we rode our bikes out to Exploration Park and all around there.\n\nI've taken a toddler to the playground area and he adored the western theme and the grassy fields to run down and fall into.  They also have a 'water area' but I could never figure out when they have it turned on or not.  Days that you think they would have it, they don't! \n\nI've never made it to the \"Movies Under the Stars\" (probably because I didn't know when it was but probably would have gone), so I couldn't ever take advantage of their amphitheater setting.  I did pass by for their \"1st Annual Mountain's Edge Snow Day\" and the snow pile was a bit small from what I was expecting.  But it looked like the kids loved it nonetheless.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty park and large in comparison to others.  Parking can be a challenge on spring and fall weekends when guests arrive early to score the tables and limited shaded areas for parties and what not.  They also have security on bike patrol, which helps keep the riffraff out.\n\n4.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "fUFykr8Mf9VANDHAFEo_Rw"}

It's not very expensive, and mostly because of it's fabulous location!  It is right in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.  With the Bellagio right across the way, Caesar Palace diagonal, The Venetian next door, and the Wynn only a block or so away, it is an awesome location!  \n\nThe rooms are standard, nothing to really rage about.  You get what you pay for.  However, just my luck that the times I have been there, I'm been upgraded...not once, not twice, but three times!  Yep, that's right.  I found myself in the Celebrity Suite, which can mean different things, depending on what tower you stay in.  And yes, the North Tower is newer.  I have stayed in both towers and been in the Celebrity Suites in both towers too.  The South tower had a larger room, but the North Tower had newer furniture.  You can't help but love it when you find yourself with a king size bed, a hot tub, a steam room, and a separate living room/dining room/wet bar.  I even found a gym in one of my rooms!  Yes - a gym!  \n\nAlthough the last time I didn't get the Celebrity Suite, I still found a bidet in my room.  I mean, the last time I saw a bidet was in France!  Fancy that! \n\nThe view from my rooms have ranged from the water show at the Bellagio to the Barbary Coast hotel on the other side. It just all depends on what you really want.\n\nAnd no, I am so not a gambler!  It's just my luck that the front desk wanted to upgrade me!  So, I think the front desk staff is fabulous in my book!  Be extra nice to them, and don't forget to tip when they do help you out!  After all, they are doing YOU a favor.  \n\nSide note: If you're flying in, you can actually check in and get your hotel key at the airport.  They have a section by the baggage claim for you to skip the lines at the hotel and get your keys there.  This can save you tons of time so you can hop on up to your room and get ready to party quicker.  (Then again, the chances of getting upgraded at the airport are less likely in my opinion.  I've always been upgraded when checking in at the actual hotel.)\n\nAnd remember...what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vT12uXtdBQ10_lUcl-M40w"}

There are plenty of concrete walkways to push a stroller (or wheelchair) or to drag an ice cooler as well.\n\nThere are even real bathrooms available (and not portable ones) for these concert events, although there can be a line as there are only a handful of stalls.\n\nDuring such events, there are usually a few vendors selling their wares, so you won't starve.  Plenty of garbage cans are available to limit littering and all the events we've attended request that no smoking take place on the lawn.\n\nI really enjoy coming out this way for these local events - it's never too crowded where you can't find a spot on the grass and many people make a picnic out of it.  (We always do!)\n\nMy only concern is that there were some unpleasant bugs running around during one of the last events we were at.  In the dim light, I saw this particular bug run across our cheese container and that just put me off and ultimately sent the cheese to the rubbish.  Technically, you don't see these bugs running around rampant, but I'm sure they do exist and come out when the sun starts to drop and there are bits of food everywhere.\n\nOverall, the Clark County Amphitheater is really clean and a great place to have these (often free) family-friendly events.

Bachi Burger was his place of choice.  I called ahead to make reservations with our large party so that the table would be set up before we get there.  \n\nOnce everyone was seated, and drink orders were in place, we got to break down the menu a bit.  Since the Ronin Burger \"Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma,  Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ($8) got a lot of praise, the Husband split that along with the Kalbi Burger \"Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo ($8) with his friend. The Ronin was the favorite of the two he tried, enough that he ordered another to share.  The cole slaw gave it a nice contrast and bite.  Whereas the added kim chee to the Kalbi made it different.  One thing that the Husband thought could be improved was the size of the burger.  He felt they were a bit small, and one burger won't cut it for a growing man (even with fries).\n\nI started off with the Organic Edamame Soybean \"Sauteed with Garlic Butter, Truffle Oil\" ($3) because who doesn't love a little truffle oil in their food.  It was good, greasy, but definitely yummy!  It's cooked in garlic butter, and I'm not used to cooking my edamame in any kind of butter!\n\nYou can't say no to their Truffle Parmesan Fries \"Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli\" ($4).  It comes in a nice cone with dipping sauce and it had all the kids grabbing some.\n\nAnother thing they do great is their Sweet Potato Fries \"Crispy Sweet Potato dusted with Sea Salt Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ($4).  They are sweet, but salty and the dipping sauce complements it well.\n\nThe kids loved their Chili Fried Chicken \"Marinated in Ginger, galic, soy sauce.\" ($6) that they ordered a second round.\n\nTo close out, we ordered the Portuguese Donuts \"Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato\" ($5) with a birthday candle in it.  (Sometimes restaurants throw in dessert for free when celebrating a birthday, it's not the case here.)  They were donut holes with lots of cinnamon sugar on it.  The accompanying gelato didn't taste like coffee much.\n\nService - we got the waiter that everyone talks about.  He really does try, a bit too hard, and that's where he goes wrong.  You can't blame the guy for trying, right?  They could ultimately learn to work as a team though since we definitely had to wave down our waiter for things, and when we tried asking other staff for things, they just passed it on to our waiter.  \n\nOverall, Bachi Burger definitely had some interesting takes on their version of meat between bread. There were some high points and okay points.\n  \n3.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "PXviRcHR1mqdH4vRc2LEAQ"}

We easily took over the two long tables in the middle, although there was still plenty of room in the booth-like tables, and in the little loft area on the right when you enter.\n\nOne thing I definitely appreciate are the bottles of iced Korean tea readily available on the tables.  This makes life (for customers and employees) so much easier because then you don't have to wave the staff down for refills every few minutes.  The unusual thing (for most of us) were the gold bowls on the tables.  We could only assume they were cups for drinking, but were a bit unsure.\n\nThey started off with three different kinds of banchan that evening - cabbage kim chee, string beans, and fish cake.  A bit skimpy on the banchan side of things, but was overlooked.\n\nFour of us decided to share a few items:\n\n* Kim Chee Fried Rice ($7) - This was topped with a fried egg.  It was REALLY good, surprisingly tasty and really enjoyable.  Something I don't usually order, but would definitely order again at Soyo.\n\n* Beef Short Ribs with Korean BBQ Sauce ($12) - A bit tough to eat, but had a good flavoring and the right amount of time on the grill.  We couldn't complain about the price either.\n\n* Spicy Pork Ribs ($10) - Another dish that the boys devoured and enjoyed.  The price wasn't too bad for this dish as well.\n\n* Spicy Soft Tofu with Seafood, Beef or Pork Soup ($8) - I was pretty stuffed by the time this dish arrived.  It was pretty standard for a soft tofu soup, and I chose the seafood option for it.\n\nThey also have quite a few things they describe as \"Korean tapas\" and lots more entree options.\n\nThe only real complaint was the service.  It was a bit understaffed with only two people working.  They should have had another person, especially with our large party that took over.  We had to remind them about certain items - rice, for example.\n\nOverall, everyone was surprised with how the bill turned out.  Even with alcohol, it was a lot less expensive that most people thought it was going to be.  Soyo Barstaurant is a welcome addition to the area and we hope they stick around.

A recent  Yelp event gave us a taste, which was a good thing since we found ourselves in the neighborhood earlier this week.\n\nI remember they were offering Happy Hour from 4 pm to 7 pm, so we scooted our butts in for some Monday night football.\n\nHappy Hour means half all appetizers (except the Spicy Ahi) and $2 off drinks.\n\nAfter walking in and the bartender greeting us, we took a seat in the dining room in front of the large screen.  With a pretty decent selection of apps to choose from, we decided on four:\n\n* Potato Pancakes \"Ham, potato and chive pancakes with applesauce and your choice of horseradish or sour cream.\" ($7.99)  Four pancakes that are lightly fried and tasty.  We automatically got sour cream with ours, which was no biggie since we didn't even remember horseradish was an option.\n\n* Crab Cakes \"Crab cakes drizzled with our creamy mustard sauce and pineapple relish.\" ($10.95) - You actually get crab cakes, as in the plural, when you order this.  Three to be exact.  And the creamy sauce added to this dish very nicely.  You can tell there's definitely a decent amount of crab and not just filler in these cakes.\n\n* Chicken Wings \"Ten wings served with celery, carrots and your choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  Available in BBQ, Honey Mustard, Teriyaki, or Buffalo style.\" (Boneless $11.95 / Traditional $10.95)  The Husband remembers seeing other yelpers order this from before, so he was game to get his own share.  I was surprised when the order of 11 wings showed  up.  He chose boneless and buffalo style.  They were meaty pieces of poultry and what a steal at half off! \n\n* Queso Cammarones \"Shrimp, artichoke hearts and sauteed spinach, melted together in a blend of provolone, romano and parmesan cheeses.  Served with tortilla chips.\" ($8.95) - Your basic artichoke and spinach dip, but taken to a new level with shrimp hidden underneath.  It's a heavy dish and you definitely need to share this one for sure! \n\nService - what can I say?  Our waitress was friendly, the owner said hello when he passed by, and someone from the kitchen came by to chat with us not once, but twice!  And the bartender thanked us for coming in when we left!  They are a friendly bunch here!  We even got little martini shakers as gifts during out visit! \n\nOther appetizers worth checking out would be their oysters on a half shell, bleu cheese tomatoes, and red pepper hummus! Next time!\n\nOverall, I'm always pleased when I find a restaurant with great happy hour specials and Straight Up definitely offers some good ones! \n\nThey also have different events for each day...better call ahead to double check if they are still going on though!\n\nMondays: Buy One Get One Specialty Martini 1/2 off 7 pm to close; karaoke at 10 pm with Karate Karaoke\n\nTuesdays: 2 for 1 Tacos, 2 for 1 Coronas, $4 Margaritas\n\nWednesdays: Live Jazz at 9 pm\n\nThursdays: 50% Off Specialty Martinis for Ladies from 7 pm to midnight\n\nFridays: Live Hawaiian and Reggae Bands at 11 pm\n\nSaturdays: Beauty Industry receive $3 off Specialty Martinis and 50% Appetizers\n\nSundays: Sunday Brunch at 10 am to 2 pm; Hospitality Industry receive 50% food and drinks all day; Wii Games from 6 pm to closing with a winner getting a free well drink!\n\nUpdate!  We returned the following week...\n\n* Roasted Red Pepper Hummus \"Served with crispy tortilla chips.\" ($6.95) - It's served with pita chips, not tortilla chips.  But that wasn't the problem, the hummus was really dried out.  Not sure if they make their own, but it was definitely lacking in olive oil.  I thought I had tried it before at an event, but I guess not.  Nonetheless, I brought home the leftovers and added some EVOO to help bring it back to life.  It still was lacking.\n\nWe also ordered the chicken wings again and attempted to order their \"Spicy Garlic\" style, which was something off the menu.  Unfortunately, the day we went, that chef working wasn't familiar with that style.  He did offer to make it for us, but we decided to stick with what was on the menu.  They also ran out of ranch dressing.  We were told they make it fresh, and the waitress was able to scrape up a little bit of what was left.  But by the time she asked if I needed more, the wings were done. Oh well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6QQ1qO4X9NBBsrq4tYb5dQ"}

Conveniently located on Spring Mountain, right next to the super busy Raku.  (Smart business choice I would say.)\n\nThis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  Their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (A couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\nI went for their most popular dish - Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.95).  The main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  This results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  It automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and green onions.  Their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the Chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nThe Husband went for the Miso Ramen ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  This was also good, and quite filling.\n\nWe also shared a regular order of the Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75).  It sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  I adore pork belly and the next time I come here, I'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  It's fatty and good.  \n\nA side dish we added on was the Takana Mustard Leaf ($1.50).  You can have this on the side or in your broth.  It's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  It's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  Other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or green onions.\n\nThere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - Shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  You can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"Kaedama.\"  Other dishes available are gyoza, fried rice, kim chee fried rice, takana fried rice, cha siu bowl, and mini mentaiko (marinated polluck roe).\n\nService was good.  With two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  It's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nUpdate!  \nI returned the following month for my own bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl.  This time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.

I was first excited about them because they had raving reviews...but lately it's been going down so I definitely went in with some hesitation.\n\nFirst off, I've been trying to sign up for their email specials but have yet to receive anything (even though I signed up months ago).  The receptionist said they sent an email out in December, but I never got it.  Bummer.\n\nOn their website, they have daily specials and I wanted to take advantage of one of them.  When I called in on a Thursday, the receptionist wasn't that familiar with what the special was or even if it was valid since they hadn't updated their website in awhile.  She eventually did look it up and it was supposed to be \"Free Nail Art with purchase of a pedicure.\"  She said it was still valid and I went forward with booking our appointments.  I initially tried for a 4:00 appointment for two pedicures, the next available time was 5:00 pm, but she was able to get us both in at 4:45 pm.  \n\nWe arrived a bit early so we could get situated and pick our our nail colors.  They were packed - all the workers had customers in front of them and the phone was ringing.  No kidding about making an appointment! There's also a self service cooler on the left - so help yourself! We were seated in the pedicure chairs by 4:50 pm, so there was no delay there.\n\nNow, I haven't been to too many nail salons, but I guess I'm used to be being taken care of.  The simplest thing like helping me into the pedicure chair, moving the arm rest out, helping me set down my beverage, and showing me how the massage chair works can really do wonders.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen here - and the sight of watching a 38 week pregnant girl stepping gingerly into the chair can be quite a sight.  A little assistance would have been really nice!  (Plus, we were carrying our purse, magazines, beverage, shoes, etc. - so we definitely didn't have any extra hands available.)\n\nAfter the Mom and I finally got settled into our chair and we figured out how the controls worked, we tried to relax for our little pampering session.  Diane (aka Mom) was assigned to take one of us and she chose me.  My pedicure got started and it was pretty standard.  Diane kept the conversation to a minimum, which was totally fine with me.  I did notice that she started cutting my cuticles and went for the baby toe first.  And yes, she made it bleed.  I could tell by the way she kept wiping it, covering it, getting the blue stuff to put on it, and then the way it would sting when I put my foot back into the water.  Hmmm...bleeding on the first toe?  Also, I think Diane might have had a cold or something because she was coughing (a lot) on my feet.  And all I could think about was thank goodness I wasn't getting a manicure too.  I completely forgot about the free nail art that I was supposed to get until after the fact.   \n\nWhereas the Mom had a younger girl working on her (Nicole) that was very chatty from the beginning.  At first, I thought she was talking to the Mom, but then I realized she was actually talking to another customer next to the Mom.  I learned later that the Mom didn't really appreciate that and wished Nicole had spent more time focusing on her and her feet instead of facing someone else and chatting with them.  She also mentioned that Nicole could have spent more time massaging her feet, which I would have to agree with too.\n\nThe Mom was finished first, despite her starting later and having more work done.  Nicole sent her to the drying station so she could dry her toes further, whereas Diane just said she was all done.  I didn't really know where to go after that since there were only two chairs available in the drying area and they were both taken.\n\nThere is a really young staff here and they are quite the social bunch - the employees do talk a lot amongst themselves (in English) and I guess it feels more like a hair salon with all the random banter going on regarding house stuff, weekend plans, etc.  They are extremely busy and walk-ins will get serviced, if you have something minor to take care of.  (Which sucks if that means your technician leaves you to take care of a walk-in.) \n\nThey also have a referral program, but the new customer has to have the referral card with them for you to get any benefits from it.  Other promotions include:\n\n* Buy 4 Spa pedicures for $99 and get a mani/pedi free.  ($137 value)\n\n* Buy 4 Acrylic Fills for $75 and get a acrylic set free. ($100 value)\n\n* Buy 9 manicures for $99 and get two manicures free. ($132)\n\nYou get 10% off your next appointment if you book immediately.\n\nIt's been a week since I got my pedicure and my toes look pretty damn good still, so that's a major bonus point.  I wished she did scrub my feet more so they could be baby soft, but that didn't happen.  I did purchase one of their value cards, so I'll be going back at a less busier time I hope.\n\n3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tsqcZEvZYTpqux7_IGHVw"}

A busy weekend of festivals for Las Vegas!\n\nThis is a serious festival that is well organized and definitely has its share of experience in running a successful event.  First off, the location is on the St. John the Baptist Greek Orthodox Church grounds.  They do offer tours of the church on some of the festival days, which is a nice way to learn a little bit about the history of the church and check out the inside.\n\nThe festival has your typical ethnic eats - a map lays out where everything is offered and you can take your pick of trying something new or something you're already familiar with.  (My suggestion is to order a bunch of different things and share it all - so you can try it all!)  Be sure to hit up the dessert section too - my favorite was the chocolate baklava! \n\nEntertainment - Laid out on the grassy areas are plenty of tables and chairs for the ongoing entertainment.  \n\nThere is also a designated kids area, making this event super family-friendly.  Of course, all the attractions do cost a fee.\n\nVendors - They have more traditional ethnic booths selling their Greek-related wares, and those other random timeshare vendors too.  (You just can't escape those ones in Vegas!)  A quick look at the vendors doesn't hurt anyone! \n\nParking - There is residential parking in the neighborhood (you need to get there early to take advantage of any of these spots), but they also have shuttle buses available so parking is available in designated lots a bit further away!  Talk about organized! \n\nWe hit up the festival on Friday night, which was perfect this time of year with the extreme heat going on.  It was THE perfect evening to hang out, and for many, with a bottle of wine purchased at the festival.  I'd definitely recommend going in the evening for dinner and wine! \n\nAdmission was $6 for adults, but free for children 12 and under and free for active duty military and their families.  They have a lot of lines open, so there should be no wait getting in.\n\nOverall, this was a new experience for me since it was my first time hitting up this festival.  It's definitely better than some of the other cultural festivals in town.  Keep your eyes and ears out for next September!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xvD_AUYMtbgjjX3rUwXBzA"}

The Husband has been loving this place since I brought him here (thanks Yelp!) and he can't get enough!\n\nBFG...it stands for Baked, Fried, or Grilled if you missed that part.  \n\nThe menu can't be any simpler - it puts In N Out's menu to shame.\n\nWith five combos to choose from and a create your own combo, it makes ordering super easy. \n\nTheir fried chicken strips come in a four count and they are special because they are panko covered and deep fried.  Yes, that makes all the difference.  But wait, there's more beyond the chicken!  I'm talking about the wasabi cream dipping sauce that we can't get enough of.  Sure, there are other flavors and you get two with your order, but we're all about the wasabi cream!  Yum!  I've also tried their grilled chicken and was impressed with how moist it was.  Next time I'll have to check out their baked version.\n\nOf course, I have to mention their individually baked mac and cheese side, right?  They are so gooey and hot, and that's what you call a serious baked mac and cheese.  They definitely got that right!  A little more work on their end but definitely appreciated and worth it!  Or if you must, you can have grilled veggies or fries as a side.\n\nAnd there's still more to rave about - the garlic bread is good too!\n\nAnother perk - loyalty stamp cards!  Yes, that's right!  You get a stamp for every combo meal you order, so it's easy breezy to get a free combo meal with this plan!  \n\nAnd finally, I cannot say enough about the customer service there.  Jin is the nicest guy around - not only does he make a honest and sincere effort to know who you are (and remember your name), but he also comes around to check on you if you're dining in.  They really make you feel at home and special and I have to give major props to that alone because it really makes a huge difference.\n\nI also have to give props to the rest of the staff because you don't have a lazy bunch working here.  They are always coming around to wipe down the tables, push in chairs, offer free dessert, and just make sure you're happy.  \n\nTheir only real fault is that their location is too small!  But that only means they should open a few more locations to make our lives easier!  Yes, that's right.  Check out their weekly specials too!  They have a great thing going on here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "N8cJk5s9yW3fLeJyHQeRAA"}

For only two dollars more ($7.95), you can make it a two item lunch special from their list.  That's a pretty good deal already!\n\nSoup of the day (on both visits) were an egg drop soup that had chunks of goodies in it and fried garlic on top.  A nice start to lunch.  \n\nFirst visit, the Husband had the two item lunch special - Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef and the Panang Chicken with the Fried Tofu appetizer, whereas I had the one item lunch special - Yellow Curry with Tofu with the Fried Wonton appetizer.  With the two item lunch special, we thought they would give him less of each, but it was actually two full regular lunch portions.  Definitely a great deal!  They even asked if I wanted soft or fried tofu for my entree choice.  My curry was loaded with lots of veggies - carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, napa cabbage, and baby corn.  All their entrees were good and tasty and we were both pleased with our choices.  \n\nOn our second visit, we both got the one item lunch - the Husband stayed with his Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef Choice with the Fried Wonton appetizer while I had the Panang with Tofu with Fried Eggroll appetizer.  They did get our spices mixed up on this visit though.  I requested medium while the Husband asked for spicy.  His has no spice while mine had all the heat.  It was still good nonetheless.\n\nBe sure to ask for the Thai condiments - sometimes they automatically give it to you while other times you have to ask for it.\n\nTheir version of Thai iced tea is pretty good and a steal at $1.75.\n\nService is fine - both times we went was after the lunch rush so we were attended to as needed.\n\nOverall, Thai Style Noodle House ranks up higher than some of the other Thai restaurants in the area offering lunch specials.\n\nMinimum $15 for credit card use.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nIbXwOgthwCM2dhug5viCA"}

Sure, anyone can build shaved ice and put it in a cup, but good companies pack it really well so it can sustain its shape as you pour the syrups in.  It was already falling apart by the time he came back to the car, which was ten feet away.  Second, it looked like there wouldn't be enough syrup because it was already turning white on top.

As we entered this city of lights and desert heat, all I could ever remember thinking was, \"I could never live in Las Vegas...it's so far from the ocean!\"\n\nFast forward to 2006 and I started to become a regular visitor to this city that was once so foreign to me.  Before I knew it, I'm living here and starting a completely new life here with the boyfriend (the BF).  It's here in this city that the boyfriend became the Big F (the fiance), and eventually, the Husband.  \n\nLas Vegas started to grow on me as I discovered more activities and events that kept us busy beyond the Strip life.  (And it doesn't hurt that we have our fave restaurants here - Ichiza, Hot N Juicy Crawfish, Shabu Shabu Paradise, Luv-It Custard, Poke Express, Lawry's, etc.)  \n\nYelp came along last year with an official community manager, which meant even more fun times and more great people to meet!  Las Vegas was getting better and better in my eyes!\n\nBut it's 2011 that the City of Las Vegas has brought on a new role for me in my life, and that is the role of \"mother\".\n\nOn January 16th, I gave birth to my adorable son (the Baby) and on his birth certificate it says he was born in the City of Las Vegas, Clark County.  \n\nThis city has now brought on a new permanence in my life.  Not only has it become my home, but the home of my family. \n\nAnd so, I can't help but love the City of Las Vegas.

The first time, I walked in at 10:15 pm.  They apparently close down the ice cream section at 10 pm sharp and they aren't willing to budge on that one bit (even if you are pregnant)!  And they don't sell Thrifty's ice cream by the gallon or pint on the freezer section either.  So if you want your fill, get there between the times of 11 am and 10 pm.\n\nThe second time, there were out of Chocolate Malt Crunch.  What's the point, right?  I took one look at the case and gasped when I noticed my desired flavor was replaced with something else.  The woman behind the counter confirmed that they were out.  Strike two!\n\nAnd finally, a few days ago I suggested to the Husband might we swing on my Smarty's again for another go at it.  And thankfully they had it!  I wasn't messing around this time - three scoops please, in a waffle cone ($2.99).  Sure, they don't have the old school Thrifty scoop, but they have the ice cream at least.

However, the Yangs (Bobby and Misti) were the first to tell us that they were reopening business in this shopping center and we anxiously awaited their grand opening.  \n\nWhat we loved most was their hot pot option - something that currently is not offered.  (Word from Auntie Bo directly said she'll be starting the hot pot business again come the new year! Yay!)\n\nWe even missed out on the famous CMYE: Breakfast of Champions event, which got raving reviews and reinforced how fabulous the Taiwanese breakfast experience was there.  (We plan on hitting it up one of these days!)\n\nOne day the Husband came home and said he wanted some Spicy Beef Noodle Soup from Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli. Apparently someone from work had been raving about it, and yelpers concurred!  So off we went to dinner!\n\nThis is what we tried:   \n\n* Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) - This is THE thing to order at Yi Mei.  Look around and you'll see every table have a bowl of this.  Every review talks about it and I can see why.  The Husband liked it and found the beef to be tender.  I was personally enjoying the noodle part more.  It had a good texture, something that Suki L. talks extensively about it in her review.  It also came with bok chopy and pickles, be sure to ask for more of those preserved pickles because they add a nice contrast to the dish.  Bring me a bowl of the noodles, broth, bok choy, and pickles and I'm good to go! \n\n* Special Fry Tofu ($4.99) - This was a long shot because we weren't sure exactly what was going to make this a 'special' fried tofu.  While we waited for this dish to arrive, the Husband asked if they had the stinky tofu still.  I wasn't sure since there was another dish on the menu called \"Hot Spicy Special Tofu\" and thought that may be the dish!  When it did come, it looked like before with pickled cabbage and a dipping sauce.  When I bit into it, it was definitely the stinky tofu.  The texture was a bit dried out, but the crispiness of the tofu was refreshing.\n\n* Green Onion Pancake ($2.99) - One pancake arrived and it was a bit thicker than what I'm used to getting. We needed to add some hot chili oil (and other condiments found on the table) to give it a little more of a kick.  I personally prefer thinner green onion pancakes.\n\n* Steamed Bao ($4.99) - Also known as Shanghai dumplings or \nXiao Lung Baos.  They were the last to arrive.  There were eight small dumplings that were a little gummy and could have used a bit more time in the steamer.  I prefer it that way so the hot soup within the dumpling can burn my tongue a bit.\n\nThis is a pretty casual restaurant where there is a self service station for hot tea, water, and utensils.  You'll find this on your immediate right when you walk in.  Take a seat and be sure they know you sat down so you'll get menus.  (Try to ignore the spelling errors on the menu.) And when you're ready to pay, head to the register and know what number table you sat on to help them out.\n\nThis place is steadily busy, and not just from new customers who happen to be shopping at the nearby 168 Market.  But rather, these are long-time customers from their old restaurant.  You can tell they have a strong following.\n\nWhen the Husband was paying, he got a chance to meet and talk with Auntie Bo, who is just the friendliest lady.  That's when we heard that hot pot was returning come the new year and we were psyched!  You can't help but love the family-oriented atmosphere where regulars come to enjoy some quality homelike food.  She really makes an effort to know her customers!   \n\nNot only is Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli a restaurant, but it's a mini market as well. You'll find dried goods and refrigerated items for sale.  Take a look around for some interesting and unique goods!\n\nUpdate! 01.06.11 - I stopped by and asked Auntie Bo about the return of the hot pot. Looks like it's not going to happen anymore. =(  She said they just don't have the staff to do it.  Oh well.  But she did mention Dragon House as an option for hot pot which I can confirm!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qCOCPoxRo9_lLixup-TPTg"}

But hands down, these pancakes are REALLY good.  They aren't too fluffy or thick.  The sweetness is just perfection and sweetness from the cocoa, whipped cream, and syrup all add to this yummy cake.  I was sold and would definitely reorder this over and over again.  We went for the full stack to share, which was a very smart choice! \n\n* Kalua Pig Benedict \"A toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, English muffin.  Topped with our delicious hollandaise sauce.\" ($9.75) - The Husband and Truc N. were loving this dish.  As Truc was saying, he doesn't really like pork all that much but he really enjoyed their version.  They both complimented on how moist the meat was and enjoyed the savoriness.  The accompanying potatoes could use a something something though. \n\n* Rick's Adobo Fried Rice \"A traditional Filipino dish made with marinated shredded chicken wrapped in an egg, garnished with green onions.\" ($8.50) - This was the downfall of our breakfast.  It was a huge scrambled egg concoction with the fried rice mixture inside.  I was the first to split it open and there was a weird smell that came from it.  And then the taste, I wasn't quite getting it and wasn't sure if this was how it was supposed to taste.  When the Husband got into it, he ultimately said their burned it - the rice, the meat, just everything inside.  I'm still not sure if it was intentional to have the 'burnt' taste or not, but all of us were not impressed with it.  Not something we recommend.\n\nOverall, they have some unique items that make them stand out - specifically the first two items we ordered and additional things like Honey French Toast, S'more Pancakes, Bacon Pancakes, seasonal items like Pumpkin Pancakes and Macadamia Nut Pancakes.\n\nService - it did take awhile for our food to come out.  And I can only imagine how much longer the wait may be on weekends after you get seated.  And yes, there is more than just the food here, the view is quite nice too for the men.  I don't recommend coming with a large group as it's a small restaurant and there isn't that much room for large groups.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

All we wanted was a Cuban Sandwich ($5) and a Iced Cuban Coffee ($1).  What the Husband liked about their sandwich was that they had two variations of pork in there - slow roasted pork leg and rosemary ham.\n\nThey also gave us a complimentary order of their Dirty Chips ($4) which was so awesomely good that it had us wanting more!  There's barbecued pulled pork, Mexican cheese, jalapeno hollandaise sauce and cilantro sitting on a bed of potato chips.  \n\nOf course, we couldn't say no to an order of their Key Lime Beignets ($4).  It's dusted with coconut sugar alongside a Tres Leches Caramel sauce and it's yum yum good!  And plenty enough to share!\n\nAs a result, we're always looking for where their truck is and the Husband got another chance to savor their Dirty Chips once again.\n\nMost recently, we found them last week and although Dirty Chips wasn't on their blackboard, it's on their printed menu (so be sure to ask)!  The Husband wanted his own order, so we got two.  I also got an order of their Roasted Chicken Mac N Cheese ($6).  It's definitely more chicken and cheese than mac, that's for sure!  The chicken was so super moist and juicy and it had to be a crime to be considered chicken!  That dark meat sure taste good!  It's dripping with cheese sauce, and there's also some mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in there too.\n\nSadly, I haven't been able to order their beignets due to a restricted diet, but they had them with strawberries last week.  Also unique was their Homemade Corned Beef Hash Sandwich that I saw a few people chowing on.  \n\nOverall, the Husband won't bother with a food truck meet up if Lulu's and SnoW Ono aren't there.

So, I had to go where he was and experience his magical hand, right?\n\nIt was my mom and I on this experience and we made appointments just in case.  We were led into a semi-private space with two chairs.  Rex worked on me while my mom had Lee.  \n\nAs with all of good foot massage places, your feet start off in a hot bath while they work on you head, neck and shoulders.  Then they eventually move onto your feet and then have you sit up to work on your shoulders before having you flip over and lie down!  Yep, lie down I tell you!  I love it when they tell me to flip over and lie down!  (Not all Vegas foot massage places offer this \"flip over\" business!)  That's when they get to working on your back and pushing you this way and that way while your face is in this hole.  This is what I was looking for!\n\nOne of the cool things they have are hooks for your purse and jackets - nice touch.  It's the little things that matter!\n\nI definitely appreciated that Rex makes a point of looking at the clock when he starts and telling you what time it is so there's no confusion about that.  (Unlike a few other places that claim you're getting a 60 minute treatment, but it's really 50.)\n\nAt the end of our service, Rex assures me that it's always the same people working there - himself, Lee, Elaine (or Eileen) and Carol.  I think this is because there are so many places that contract workers here and there.  So that makes me feel that you are certain of getting a specific kind of experience there.\n\nThey also offer a Yelp discount too! \n\n4.5 stars.\n\n* Update! (09.20.11)\nGoing down to a 4 star rating.  Lee worked on me last night and although he was good, the smell of cigarette smoke is very distracting.  I hate to have to ask ahead of time if the person working on me is a smoker or not, but I have a strong sense of smell!  That put me off from the very beginning.  Also, Rex took a call while he was working on the Husband.  Yes, I know it's business and all, but very distracting and a big pet peeve of ours.  Get someone else to handle the phones please.\n \nRight before they started working on our feet, they mentioned that they could make my feet like a baby's butt...for an additional 30 minutes and a $29 charge.  It includes a hot wax...which I assume is a parafin wax dip. Although I love having my feet super soft, we had to pass this time around.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Db75Zr2zrKyiWzVUPkG2OQ"}

We've been hearing a lot of talk about this place with strangers asking, \"Do you know when they are going to open?\"\n\nOn Friday night, there was a LONG line to get seated, at least over an hour.  However, there was a much shorter, quicker line on the left for to go orders only.  Sweet!  \n\nThe Husband chose the Pepperjack Melt \"Two Steakburgers with melted pepperjack cheese, lettuce, vine-ripened tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos, and mayo on grilled sourdough.\"  First off, it didn't quite look as huge or stacking as advertised, a bit more smashed down.  At one point, the Husband pointed out the lack of jalapenos (and spiciness) in his sandwich.  Meanwhile, we realized that the cut up green stuff in the little plastic cup were his jalapenos, guess you have to add them in yourself.  It also came with fries, thin-style.  Nothing to write home about.  \n\nMeanwhile, I ordered the Chili Max Deluxe.  When I opened my container, it was surprisingly smaller than what I envisioned and I didn't realize it came on spaghetti!  It reminded me of the spaghetti from Jollibee's!  The Husband also paid 99 cents more for extra beef.  I'm looking at my spaghetti and realizing there is no diced onions, shredded cheese, etc. as advertised.  Before I head back to tell them of the error, I look over my receipt and see they they only charged me for the Chili Max.  (Apparently, they did ring me up for the Chili Max Deluxe initially.  But when we added the extra beef , they needed a manager's assistance and ended up deleting that order, and inputting the Chili Max instead.)  I ended up using the little container of jalapenos in my chili to give it a little kick.  I'm afraid to know what the dish would have looked like without the extra beef we paid for.\n\nOf course, you can't hit up Steak 'n Shake without trying their infamous shakes - I went for the Mint Cookies 'n Cream Specialty Shake.  It was yummy good, until I got to the bottom third and noticed no cookies down below.  When it gets mixed, apparently the toppings only stay on the top.  The Husband tried their Strawberry Banana Side By Side Milkshake and it was pretty good.  It was a lot smoother than mine, probably because there was no mixing required.  They also have holiday milkshakes (White Chocolate, Egg Nog, and Peppermint Chocolate Chip) going on right now - which I totally didn't see until after the fact! \n\nI also noticed that they gave me a spoon for my spaghetti chili.  Are you serious?  No fork, no knife, just a spoon.  Last time I checked, I haven't seen anyone try to eat spaghetti with only spoon.  A bit inconvenient when you're getting a to go order and things are missing.\n\nAnd yes, the hostesses dealing with the lines are super nice.  It looked like they had plenty of people on staff as I saw a lot of loitering by the management.  There definitely was a back up on food delivery for those dining in.  (I noticed one server waiting for the rest of her shake orders from the moment I put my order in and until I actually got it, she was still waiting.)\n\nOverall, we've been there and done that.  Steak 'n Shake sadly didn't live up to its expectations.  We both agreed that we loved the shakes though and would come back for that.  But with our dinner costing $20, we left unfulfilled.\n\nThey are currently selling gift cards with a promotion. Buy at least $20 worth, and get a $5 off coupon in your next order (in January/February).  \n\nHappy hour: Weekdays only, 2 pm to 4 pm, and 2 am to 4 am - Half off shakes and drinks", "type": "review", "business_id": "npfVfumxVAkQNYpY1fSvew"}

Island Style was our last stop, and for some reason, the Mom was more interested in what they had to offer.\n\nShe was eyeing the Bibimbap for $7.95, and I mentioned that the Husband likes that dish too, but with the stone pot version.  We inquired and found out their Dolsat Bibimbap was $8.95.  (She wasn't very familiar with the dish.)  As I pondered what to get, an order of fried dumplings were placed in front of us for another customer.  The Mom was immediately impressed by it and the smart guy at the counter pointed out that you get the dumplings for free if your order was $20 or more.  Of course, that easily sold us and we added the Kalbi Plate ($12.95) to our lunch to get that order of dumplings!\n\nWe took a seat nearby and waited for our order.  The order of 10 dumplings were ready first, and they do usually go for $5.95.  It was piping hot and we loved the extra crispy texture.  It was filled with pork and noodles.

The restaurant is set up in sections making private parties a great possibility.\n\nOnce we were seated, there was a slight lapse where we thought we had been forgotten. Instead, they were deep frying a fresh taste of their mountain potato to get your taste buds working.\n\nThe menu is easily broken up with their daily specials being the star. It's very much a revolving menu as items available two months ago aren't offered now.\n\nOur dinner items:\n\n* Deep fried Yamaimo - This mountain potato was lightly fried with a sprinkling of furikake.  The delicate flavor surprisingly impressed us and had us wanting more of this complimentary offering.  As someone asked, was it gooey...and not at all!\n\n* Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad ($7.50) - Five slices of salmon along with greens makes this a tasty dish.  Assembled quite simply but satisfyingly.\n\n* Albacore Jalapeno ($7.50) - Seven slices of albacore that had a sauce that we enjoyed.\n\n* Spicy Tuna Dip ($5) - A generous ball of spicy tuna alongside crispy rice crackers.  We spread the tuna onto the cracker and enjoyed the crunch along with the spice.\n\n* Agedashi Tofu ($4.30) - Good, but not quite my favorite although I still enjoyed it.\n\n* Negi Ma ($1.90) - The chicken and green onion we chose to have sauce on it, our mistake.  Skip the sauce next time.\n\n* Enoki Bacon ($2.30) - Anything wrapped in bacon tastes good!\n\n* Kawa ($2.20) - Grilled chicken skin...a dash of salt and togorashi is all you need.\n\n* Butabara ($2.20) The pork belly was a rather disappointing since it was dried out and not fatty enough for me. \n\n* Daikon Salad ($4.20) - I'm not usually a fan of daikon salad but the simple additions to their version makes it a nice and subtle dish.\n\n* Gyutan ($5.50) - The beef tongue was good, but not as tender as I would have hoped.\n\n* Kaisen Chawanmushi ($5) - Their version of a steamed custard was the real winner of the night.  It was super super smooth and luxurious and probably among the best chawanmushis I have ever experienced.  It also came with a decent amount of seafood inside and the Husband and I were both thoroughly impressed.  Worth getting your own and not sharing.\n\n* Koro Steak ($9.50) - We were told it was quite tender and that is the very truth.  We both loved the steak, but could have done without the beansprouts...something else would have been better.\n\n* Soft Shell Crab Appetizer ($5.80) - My only real complaint was that it lacked something...a dipping sauce of maybe ponzu, tempura sauce, or Japanese mayo would have been nice.  But then again, maybe that's how I usually get it elsewhere and that's how I'm used to having it.\n\n* Tofu Mousse ($4.80) \"Homemade Vanilla Tofu Mousse\" - We're all about homemade tofu and definitely wanted to try their sweet version.  It was accompanied by a raspberry(?) sorbet-like granita that could have been broken down a bit more.  It arrived in chunks that made it   difficult to get into with the wooden spoons provided.  Nonetheless, we still enjoyed this sweet ending to our dinner.  \n\nOverall, it was a lovely Mother's Day dinner.  Service was polite and what you would expect from a real Japanese restaurant.  We were impressed by the number of Japanese diners there along with the families as well.  It brings a different ambiance and we liked it.  There are a few things that are a bit more costly than what I'd expect, so be prepared.  We'll be going back again to see what other specials come up!\n\n* * Update! We returned on 06.24.  Additional items we tried included:\n\n* Beef Tataki ($9.50) - \n\n* Homemade Tofu ($4.80) - We love the simplicity of homemade tofu.  Here it is accompanied with wasabi, bonito shavings, finely grated ginger, and scallions.\n\n* Tofu Miso Kushi ($1.50) - Three pieces on a skewer, grilled with some miso sauce.  Simple and tasty.\n\n* Wakasagi Age \"Deep Fried Surf Smelt\" ($4.50) \n\n* Ayu Shio Yaki \"Grilled seasonal sweet fish from Japan\" ($9.50) \n\n* Hirame Carpaccio \"Halibut - South Korea\" ($6.50)\n\n* Gyu Shabu Salad \"Sliced Beef & Spinach\" ($6.50)\n\n* Chocolate Fondant \"Homemade Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream\" ($6.50)\n\nWe were offered a different complimentary taster, but we craved the deep fried yamaimo.

They had off the standard menu fish like bonito, kampachi, sardines, and yuzu tobiko that were included in AYCE.  That was definitely a highlight in my book!  Loving the yuzu tobiko!\n\n* Pork Belly - Yes, everyone talks about it and it's good stuff.  We love pork belly - we have marinated cooked pork belly sitting in our freezer ready to throw into the rice cooker at a moment's notice.  We love pork belly.  Sure, the portion is a meager two pieces at a time, but it's AYCE, so order up more!\n\n* Shoyu Ramen is included in AYCE after 11 pm.  Sure, we missed this, but it got the Husband all excited with the possibility of it.  (Why someone would want to fill their belly with ramen and soup during an AYCE sushi fest is beyond me.)\n\n* Dessert included, as in ALL the desserts are included!  I've been to other AYCE sushi joints that may or may not included AYCE ice cream, but they not only have a few ice cream flavors, but four different desserts to choose from.

We were lucky that Chizuru was our primary waitress because she is stellar.  And the rest of the staff, that's the problem.  From the moment we walked in and said party of four and one highchair, the hostess/waitress totally forgot to bring a highchair.  Other staff people were just not attentive, as I was often seen waving my arms around to get their attention.  Waiters who refill your beverages should really put your glass back in front of you, not at the other end of the table and watch you struggle to reach across to get it.

They have three variations of it and I went for the Boneless Dark Meat version.  It was surprisingly moist and decent portioned.  Yes, I've had better and I've also had a lot worse (especially in Vegas) but it was decent.  The seasoned rice that accompanied it could be a bit more seasoned but it worked.\n\nThe Husband had their Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.95).  This soup came with six generous all shrimp dumplings and some Chinese vegetables.  You have to give them credit for making it a very shrimpy dumpling with no filler.  \n\nWe didn't realize that their grand opening special was limited to one per person per visit, so we went ahead and ordered another beverage to score a couple more free entrees.\n\nThis time I went for the Curry Chicken with Roti Pancakes ($4.95).  I loved their version of the roti, not overly greasy and had a nice flaky texture and crunch.  The curry with chicken and potatoes had a good flavor too.\n\nThe Husband tried their Deep Fried Pork Chop ($4.95) and found it to be disappointing.  It wasn't quite what we expected and it was dried out.  Too bad about that one.  (Apparently you have to request crispy if you want it that way...but that's news to us!)\n\nWhen it came time to pay, we then discovered that we were going to be charged for the second entrees.  Due to a waitress's mistake, they took it off the bill without any hassle, which is something we really appreciated.  They didn't even charge us for the second round of beverages, rather telling us to leave it for our server instead.  Now, you gotta love that! \n\nOverall, you can't complain for the price you're getting.  A decent size portion for less than five bucks, and that's including tax!  (I heard they are adding to their menu next week, so we'll see how that goes.)  A quick bite without the fuss - a simple and straight forward menu!\n\n3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MhMFi7hae_KsaK8lHcg0iQ"}

I've attended a few and it makes for a nice day out with the family.  It's held at the California Hotel Parking Lot Venue at Stewart and Main Streets.\n\nThere are various booths selling almost anything you can find from the islands along with food vendors offering eats from Hawai'i, Samoa, and even the Cook Islands!  Entertainment is ongoing, and what a supportive group of people that show up for this!  There is definitely a lot of love for those performing and you can easily find shaded seating in the covered tent areas.  \n\nIt's not as congested as some of other (not free) aloha festivals in town, which I definitely appreciate.  I would even suggest they have a few more vendors next year since it looks like they have the space for it.  They could make the vendors booths a bit larger though because it's crowded and hot in those little booths.\n\nThere is event parking ($5?) right next door or you can search around for some free downtown parking (good luck finding any at any of the nearby hotels).\n\nThere are no ATMs at this location, which is a huge bother.  You'll have to cross into California Hotel to use their old school ATMs.    \n\nOverall, I always love anything that brings more culture and family-friendly activities to Vegas and much love to California Hotel for continuing this tradition.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eNFUtRuHs_LPCZ12tkENBg"}

Of course, the very clean fish tank is something you can't miss when you walk in.\n\nWe were given a lunch menu - on one side featured lunch specials, but the other side was where the specialty noodles were offered.  We shared:\n\n* Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles in a very light aromatic broth with wood ear mushrooms and sliced beef.  It was very flavorful and we were quite impressed.\n\n* Szechuan Eggplant with Noodles ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles with a stir-fry of eggplant, tomatoes and garlic sitting on top.  Again, very good and quite rich.  \n\nAlthough both dishes had the same noodles, they were showcased quite differently in broth versus sauce.  Once you eat a freshly made noodle, it's hard to want anything else.\n\nWhile we waited for our order, we inquired about when the demonstration for noodle pulling takes place.  The waiter told us that the chef was out, but usually during the evenings.  The chef came in a few minutes later and he started making our noodles.  It was quite impressive and definitely entertaining.  At that point, the female owner explained more about the different sizes of noodles offered (small, medium or large - although she recommends medium), and that they the hand cut noodles into water as well.  (If you've seen Bizarre Foods, you know what I'm talking about here!)  She also mentioned their appetizer dumplings as being made to order.  We initially thought they weren't offered at lunch because it wasn't on the lunch menu we were given and per another yelper's review.  On the contrary, it IS available!  Sweet!  So we added:\n\n* Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce ($4.95) - Twelve little handmade morsels sitting in a deadly chili oil sauce.  They were fresh and light, and not your average wonton.\n\n* Pork and Chives Potstickers ($4.95) - They came in a set of six that were pan fried and just filled to the brim with pork and chives.  It also came with a dipping sauce, and you can really tell the freshness of this potsticker.  They told us it takes 8 minutes for them to make it, but I think it took less.\n\nWe're loving Beijing Noodle Cafe and we think you will too!  Be sure to ask the friendly lady owner for suggestions because she is more than helpful and willing to please.

We aren't always so anxious to make the drive to Spring Mountain to get some foot work done.\n\nThe Husband noticed the sign driving on S. Rainbow and with only two yelp reviews, we were a bit hesitant.  We called ahead to find out the prices and to see if there was any availability.  They normally charge $38/hr, but with the Yelp discount - it's $34.  (They are currently offering a Yelp Deal too - $15 for $20 towards service, which I doubt you can combine.)\n\nWe didn't make an appointment but were the only ones there last night.  Angel warmly greeted us and had us take a seat amongst the handful of chairs in the main room.  As she went to get us our tea, she hastily made a few calls getting her employees in as they had gone on an errand.  She told us about her business, gave us some information on Pure Foot & Spa and reflexology, and asked us what we thought of the interior decorating.  She had our feet soaking in the hot water while we waited, so we didn't mind.  \n\nIt wasn't too long when one of the ladies returned.  She immediately got started on the Husband, so Angel started working on me while I waited for my guy to return.  As her delicate hands started working on my face, I was almost hoping my guy didn't return.  (There are some people that have gentle hands, and she's one of them.)  After a few minutes, my guy did arrive and he got started on me.\n\nEverything was pretty straightforward from them on - they work on your head, neck, and shoulders before heading to your feet and calves.  And after wiping down your feet, they flip you over so you get some back work.  One thing I really appreciate here is that they actually spend a good amount of time on your feet and calves.  Sometimes other places focus more on shoulders, but my feet and calves were what needed the attention and they got it.  \n\nUsually, I can tell the Husband is having a good experience when I hear him snoring.  This time, I didn't hear him snore at all, so I was concerned.  I was pleasantly surprised when he asked the name of his lady though because he obviously wanted to remember who she was.  Overall, we were both quite happy with our experience at Pure Foot and definitely glad to have them in the neighborhood.

My mistake was getting the falafels.  It came with an order of five and a dipping sauce.  I'm no falafel expert, but I've had my share of freshly made falafels and this was far from it.  It was dried out, possibly frozen even!  I was horrified!  But, I should have known better because this place is called the Hummus Bar after all and not the Falafel Bar.  So, stick with the hummus! It came with a cucumber, tomato and onion salad too, which was fresh.  They momentarily forgot about my pita bread, and I was stuck wondering how the heck I was going to eat my hummus.\n\nThe Husband got a some skewered meat in a pita, which he thought was just okay as well.

Where does one begin with the plethora of foot massage places along Spring Mountain? \n\nI took a chance and called The Foot Spa. I inquired if they had 2 females available in five minutes and they said yes. After explaining our options between the Basic ($20/hr) or Deep Tissue ($30/hr), and Yelp 'specials', we settled on the Basic. (Basic is more footwork whereas Deep Tissue is more back work.)\n\nWe were led into the main room that has about 7 massage beds. I went to the restroom first and noticed they were out of soap. I took the time to open the dispenser in hopes that they 'just' ran out. Nope. Nothing in there. I even checked under the sink and found 3 more empty soap bottles! I was desperate and added some water and shook it just to get something soapy to wash my hands with. I reported back to the Husband with my discovery and was surprised he didn't suggest leaving. \n\nBuckets of hot water arrived for our feet to soak and I've noticed only 1 female employee is available. (This is exactly why I call ahead.) They offer us tea or water while we soaked. They left us soaking for about 10 minutes. (I hope they don't count this as part of our hour and luckily, they didn't! It's happened to us before!) Another female arrives and they both get to work. \n\nI had LINDA and the Husband had BELLA. \n\nLinda was great! I made the mistake of declining a private single room when she offered it and now I know why. It was a pretty cramped area for her to work around as I was seated against the wall. She had to make the long trek around the other chairs to move from my head to my feet since there was  a table blocking her pathway. So that was my mistake. She did some pretty great scalp work, which I definitely appreciate it. She also does some stretching. But my favorite was her back work. She does more of a back rolling pressure massage which is what I needed, but then she kneeled on my back and put all her weight in. Mind blown! It was pretty freakin' awesome. When the Husband's massage girl tried talking to mine, she shushed her. Gotta love that! (The Husband says I usually get the chatty ones, which I detest.) When my massage was done, I told the Husband that I was leaving a bigger tip. He agreed that he would be too! He was similarly impressed with Bella's back work as well. For the Basic service, I was quite pleased. It's pretty rare when we both are equally impressed with our massage people.\n\nAt the beginning of my session, the front desk guy comes by to let me know that if I need anything, to let Linda know. I take this opportunity to tell him there's no more soap in the restroom.  He didn't understand and so I repeated myself. He seemed to understand and said he would take care of it right away. So, of course at the end of my session, I just had to check to see if they got soap. Nope! C'mon! I gave the guy over an hour to buy some soap and it didn't happen! \n\nWhen we went to pay, I told him again there was no soap in the restroom. Again, he didn't understand and I repeated myself. Then it seemed like he understood and relayed something to Linda. Ultimately, no business should ever run out of soap!\n \nThey do accept credit cards, but there's a 50 cent charge. It's posted, but it would have been nice to be told this since the Husband only realized it when he signed the credit card slip. The guy did give us back our 50 cents though. \n\n5 stars for Linda and Bella but 2 stars for the facilities and no soap! Buy some soap and remove a massage bed so it's not so cramped. \n\n3.5 stars overall\n\nThey offer a frequent visitor card - Get 10 foot massages and get 1 free.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9ytf0fFlRb0vB0YlFAvT3w"}

It's a little on the higher end price in town. (They do offer a cheaper rate after midnight.)\n\nAt Woonam Jung Lee, they serve you everything. This can be good or bad, depending on what your preference is. I prefer smaller portions of the proteins so I can try everything.

We noticed that almost every table had some form of skewer on their table.\n\nOur mini pots of choice were Lamb Soup Pot ($9.99) and the Tendon and Radish Mini Pot ($10.99).  To say these pots were filled with lots of other goodness is an understatement.  Included amongst the two pots were Chinese cabbage, enoki mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, white mushrooms, tofu, bean curd skin, pickled cabbage, pig's blood, pork intestine, crab stick, and fish balls!  (Of course, if you don't care for the pig's blood and intestines, I'm sure you can request those to be omitted.)  And  you also get a side of purple rice and vermicelli noodles.  This is a very generous portion and we finished it all...then again, we practically had to be rolled out!  \n\nThere are five degrees of spiciness you can choose for your soup, but the best part of these places are the help yourself sauce bars.  Their version includes homemade garlic oil, homemade sesame sauce, homemade soybean sauce, homemade chili oil, homemade barbecue sauce, black vinegar, soy sauce, green onions, and cilantro.\n\nThere is a sign that says \"One Pot Per Person.\"  Not sure if it's supposed to actually read \"One Person Per Pot\" or are you really allowed only one pot per person?  Nonetheless, the party of two next to us shared one pot with a bunch of skewers...so maybe it really IS one pot per person.  \n\nService is good - the owner (?) kept coming around to check on us and the waitress was quick and efficient with getting the food out and clearing everything.  And just in case you still don't know what to order, they'll bring out a tablet with pictures of the food so you know.\n\nAmbiance - They have two TVs showing old school period Chinese films and playing Chinese music.\n\nAnd another scoring point...they offer a frequent eater card!  Buy 10 pots, and get 1 free!  \n\nOverall, a very filling and pleasing dinner!  We left satisfied and are sure to return!\n\nUpdate! (05.08.12)\nSuki L. discovered that the complimentary vermicelli noodles was only a promotion, so they will now be charging for it as of May 15th.  Also, they now have white rice and purple rice available, but they may charge you extra for the purple.  (Double check on that.)  Bummer!\n\n4.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2XmS09dl3GT_WknqS9hTVA"}

(Of course, this is not to be confused with the service also known as body shampoos found at places with questionable intentions.)\n\nWhen inquiring about this service, we were led passed the chairs reserved for foot massages and into the back room.  This room had three massage beds with sinks specifically built attached to them.  The Husband and I then had our shoulders covered with a towel and plastic to prevent those areas from getting wet and we laid down with our heads over the sink.  This is where the similarities ended.\n\nThe person I had was Mark.  I have long hair.  He started to massage my scalp for a little while before turning the water on to wet my hair.  He then shampooed my hair and spent a considerable amount of time 'scratching' my scalp.  This is something that can be enjoyable and quite relaxing depending on the person and the circumstance, but it was just okay this time.  He then also did some cranial pressure before rinsing my hair of the shampoo and applying conditioner.  He made a point of making sure my hair was completely conditioned as he ran a comb through it all.  And then he rinsed all the conditioner out and squeezed some of the water out of my hair.  I was then instructed to get up so we could walk to a smaller room where he would blow dry my hair.  He then dried my hair and ran a brush through it to get rid of any tangles.  And then I was done.  Unfortunately, my hair was still a bit damp and the bottom half of my shirt in the back was all wet from the walk from the sink to the blow drying room.  (Perhaps he could have wrapped my hair in a towel to prevent that from happening.)  He apologized for the wet shirt part but I had to go blow dry my shirt as a result.  \n\n3 stars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Husband has practically no hair and he had Reao.  He said he didn't get that much scratching, but more pressure on his scalp, face, and shoulders.  While I was getting my hair blow dried, he was still getting cranial work done.  He felt so relaxed that he almost fell asleep.  He tried to inquire about what other services would take place if we had chosen the 60 minute option, but Reao did not quite understand him.  She thought he was trying to extend his experience to the 60 minute one.  He wanted to know if they were going to focus more on the scalp, shoulders, or face.  He really enjoyed it and would do it again.  \n\n4.5 stars from him.\n\nI think I lost out on the experience because: \n\na) I had a guy.  (And unfortunately I believe he smelled of cigarette smoke.  So with my sensitive sense of smell, and him running his hands through my hair, it was distracting.)  \n\nb) I have long hair.  Because so much time was spent shampooing, conditioning, and blow drying, there was less time for cranial work. Yes, I know it's called a head shampoo but you know you're really there for good cranial work.  It's almost like a glorified hair shampooing experience at your local salon.  \n\nOverall, I think if you're a bald guy, you may just love it.  Half the experience at a hair salon is getting your head shampooed and massaged and this place focuses on that part.  Unfortunately, I just didn't get that many head tingles from the experience like I was hoping for!  Would I go back?  Maybe - if I cut my hair and/or if I get a girl next time.  Some girls just know how to massage the scalp better, maybe it's the nail thing? \n\n30 minutes = $25\n60 minutes = $48\n60 minutes combo = $45 (30 minute head shampoo and 30 minute reflexology)\n\nThey are located exactly next door to Ichiza.

Look out for the $20/hr sign. \n\nI called ahead to request 2 girls and they gave me an estimated time when 2 would be ready (about 15 minutes). She already had mentioned they had guys readily available, and I asked if they were smokers. She was honest and said some were and some weren't. (I am sensitive to the smell of cigarette smoke, especially when they are working on my face and head. The smell lingers long after they are done.) \n\nWe walked in to the waiting area that was separated by the door. I appreciated that those receiving services inside didn't have to listen to customers coming and going. There's a few signs mentioning no cell phone use and quiet please. \n\nWe were pretty surprised with how many massage beds they had in the two main rooms. It's a large operation and they are busy! There was even a line for the restroom! (I'm jealous that the Husband was already getting worked on by the time I returned from the restroom.)\n\nMy massage girl was ISABEL and the Husband had MONICA. Isabel asked me often if I was okay and how the pressure was. She was very thorough on my face and scalp. She used a lot of knee work on my back and stretching. I could tell she was putting a lot of energy on my back work. I like that they put the bucket of water on a step stool while you soak. (With only being 5'1\", when I lay back during the soaking process, my feet are often almost out of the water.) Hot rocks are included in the $20/hr price. The Husband was impressed with Monica and her back work. We tipped more than we normally do as a result.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward here, there's no upsell or anything and I heard them ask other customers if they preferred a male or female. \n\nCash only.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T9V8pY5aLMM85cu9xVP3CQ"}

The waitress did apologize for the wait and gave a complimentary dessert for all of us to share.\n\nWe started off with two orders of the Best Fried Pickles Ever ($6).  It supposed to come with their scratch ranch sauce, but they had just run out and was making a new batch.  So ours were served with another sauce. Then the famous Chicken Wings (3 lbs for $22) arrived and we had our choice of three wing sauces.  It's six wings in a pound here and it didn't really look like three pounds to us.  Anyway, the best sauce of the three we tried was the Lemon Pepper.  That was dang good.  Vampire's Kryptonite was supposed to be a garlic sauce and there wasn't enough garlic flavoring at all.  We expected with a name like Vampire's Kryptonite that garlic would be oozing out of our pores by the end.  It's quite tame actually.  The Chef's Sauce of the Day was Honey Buffalo and it was just okay.\n\nNext to arrive was the Rib of the Day (6 for $13).  It was a bit messy and a bit hard to cut and pull apart.  We weren't as wowed about it as we hoped unfortunately.\n\nThe rest of our dinner came out in spurts...\n\n* Mama's Cornbread ($5) - This takes about 15 minutes to make and the waitress does let  us know upfront.  It comes in hot cast iron skillet with their homemade cajun honey butter along with sides of Country Crock spread.  It's more moist than other cornbreads and reminds me of a pancake. I liked it and even my dad who doesn't normally like crumbly cornbread thought this was okay in his book.\n\n* New Orleans' Red Rice and Beans ($10) - It came with some spicy cajun sausage that I liked!  I didn't try the fresh red beans though.\n\n* Shrimp & Grits ($8) - The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the cheesy polenta arrived in a mason jar.  The garlic bread that accompanied it was nothing special.  I especially enjoyed my grits with the cajun sausage that arrived with the red beans & rice dish.  (If I could, I would order the grits topped with cajun sausage.)\n\n* Fish and Taters ($12) - This came with a Loaded Potato Swirl, which is a potato that's been restuffed with garlic mashed potatoes.  My sister brought this home as a leftover and was sad she forgot to eat it.  The fish was tasty along with their homemade tartar sauce.\n\n* Slow Smoked Beef Brisket Sandwich ($9) - This was the last to arrive and we couldn't understand why.  We thought the brisket should have been done already and just needed to be sliced, so we don't know if the order just got lost somewhere.  The slices were a bit too thick for my dad's liking and he found the sandwich a bit dry as well.  He had the option of the coleslaw on the side or in the sandwich, and chose it on the side.  He only ate a quarter of it.\n\n* Key-Lime Pie ($5) - The favorite for the group was the dessert.  And although you had a bunch of adults sharing this one dessert, it was loved.  All of their desserts are served in mason jars, so it's a bit of a challenge when you're the first to scoop.  But once you get going, you can really dig in there.\n\nBobby Q Grille shares a space with Spectators Bar.  It's a bit confusing to find, but it's behind the Chevron gas station.  Initially it says \"No One Under 21 Allowed\" but I believe this is only reference to the bar area that is connected.  Their air condition was running a bit strong that evening that it made my dad's back hurt. \n\nOverall, I think we expected and hoped for more.  The food didn't blow us away as we thought it would and I think the lackluster chicken wings set the tone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "a-X4VbmTW0yzykWmWyoizQ"}

(It's usually $9.95/lb.)  And when you take advantage of their AYCE wings, you can also get $1 PRBs! \n\nThe Husband and I tried a few flavors - Bourbon Chipotle, Parmesan Garlic, Cajun, Southern Fried, Pineapple Curry, and Buffalo.  Sadly, we weren't blown away by any of the flavors and most were along the sweet end.  I wish the Parmesan garlic had more of a garlicky taste.  It was all served with their Firkin Dip, which pretty much tasted like Ranch dressing.  The wings were served super hot and there was a generous amount of meat on them, so that's definitely a plus.  Because it's made to order, it's probably best to put your next order in once the first order comes out.  That way you aren't waiting as long in between each round.  We probably wouldn't do the AYCE chicken wings again though.\n\nOn another visit, we both finally ordered off their regular menu.\n\n* The Butler \"An 8 oz USDA Flatiron Steak served with asparagus and with whipped potatoes.\" ($13.95) - The steak was rather under-seasoned, which was apparent by all the Worcheshire sauce I was dumping on it.  The whipped potatoes could have used more butter, perhaps I just expected more butter?\n\n* Traditional Fish N Chips \"Crispy Alaskan Cod hand-battered with our Exclusive Pub-made Beer Batter.  Served with Fries, Tangy Tartar Sauce and a Grilled Lemon.\" One Piece $10.95 or Two Pieces $13.95 - The Husband went for the two pieces and what a great choice it was.  It was some really good fish and chips!  And we were also able to substitute the fries with garlic fries, which were also super yummy.  I probably enjoyed more of his meal than my own!\n\nOverall, the food was alright, with the exception of the fish n chips (which is probably what we'd go back for).  Service was fine - it seemed like they worked as a team since many hands touched our table.  (The waiter/waitress took our beverage and food order, the busboys brought out the food, etc.)  We chose to sit at the tables by the bar instead of a booth so we could watch the TVs.\n\nThey have a unique beer card, similar to what we seen at a wine bar.  Basically you pay for a card of a certain denomination, but you can sample a little bit of each beer they have on tap.  You can take a little or a lot and it just deducts from your card.  Useful when you just want to sample a bit of everything.  It's self-service and along the back.  They do have happy hour specials along with a decent drink menu with prices listed.\n\nOne other thing - no hot water in the restroom?!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iM27P2Dk1tVocQ9ai1FHMQ"}

It also has the pleasant drops of garlic oil on top too.  Midway through his ramen, he bit into a hard chunk of noodles.  It appeared that some of the noodles were stuck together and never got cooked through.  We showed the waitress the clumped up noodles and she took his ramen away.  She asked if he would like another one and got that order in immediately.  She apologized profusely and checked often to make sure the second round was fine.  It was and the Husband ate it all up.\n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Miso flavored ($8.20).  Along with the standard pork belly, green onions, seasoned egg, and bean sprouts, mine came with corn too.  No garlic oil unfortunately.  My soup was creamy and full-bodied and very rich.  Quite tasty in my opinion.  I was pleased with my soup choice.

Subtle hints of truffle were present.\nDirty polenta ($4) took the longest and it was a major disappointment.  Cold and just blah.  \nThey accepted credit cards which was great!\n\n* Great Bao from Las Vegas, NV\nPork belly bao (3 for $10) - The crispy skin, the fatty morsels, it's all good!\nRoast duck bao - Tasty skin as well!\nChicken skewer - Three ground chicken balls and vegetables.  Although it didn't lack flavor and it wasn't dry, it was still a bit pricy for $3.50.\n\nWe returned later on that evening for more Devilicious but they had closed up! So...\n\n* Vizzi from Paramount, CA\nVenison burger - It came with a supposedly aioli that kinda hooks you when you read the description, but you couldn't taste any of it.  It's a thick burger patty, but it could have used more sauce or aioli.  It came with sprinkling of their truffled popcorn.\n\nI was craving some fries and made the crazy decision to order a plate of curly fries from the carnival side for $5.

Looks like prices went up $1...either for this event or permanently, not sure.  But we love them nonetheless! Yum yum!\n\nWe also saw turkey legs being sold by this Exotic Meat vendor.  Bad choice all around! Dry dry dry!  Our mistake!\n\nThis food truck event was different since there was an entrance fee.  I'm sure this deterred a lot of people since the food being sold by the truck wasn't on the cheap end.  Tickets cost $10 at the event or you could get them for $4-$5 plus processing fee online.  Yes, part of the proceeds went to the Three Square Food Bank.  There were also portable toilets to use - some very dirty ones (I heard) or you could pony up $1 to use the nice ones (Flush for a Cause).  Or you can enjoy some air conditioning and visit the Silverton and/or the Bass Pro Shops and use their toilets too!  Some trucks were present Saturday but not there on Sunday and vice versa.  There was a lot entertainment going on...it seems like there was a constant flow of entertainment actually.

Might be hard to find if you're not looking for it as signage is only on the front door.\n\nFirst thing we noticed was how clean the store layout was.  Everything was nicely done and had a place for it.  The only weird spot was the bar seating.  The window to the kitchen is much higher, so you're actually facing a wall should you choose to sit at the 'bar'. \n\nThe Husband ordered the Buta-san Ramen ($9.50) with Nitamago and Toroniku Don Mini Rice Bowl ($3.50).  He was initially going to do just the ramen but the waitress did an up sell and for only three dollars more, we got a little rice bowl.  The 'Heavenly Pork\" had plenty of meat in it and the stewed pork rice bowl was very tasty.  He preferred the noodles at Shoku versus a few other ramen places we've been to in town, although he wasn't quite as impressed with the broth.\n\nI had the Miso Ramen ($8.50) with Nitamago and Ikura Don Mini Rice Bowl ($3.50).  It's not a bad deal with the add on rice bowl and egg for $3.50.  I found the broth to be quite creamy, although I did have miso in mine.  And it was more than enough food with my added ikura rice bowl.  I had a good amount of meat in my ramen as well.\n\nThey do give you the soft-boiled egg on the side here, which I am on the fence about.  I don't particularly like it on the side because the egg is cold.  But then again, the creamy egg yolk doesn't leak into the soup right away.  I guess I could always put the egg into my soup to warm it up.\n\nWe also really enjoyed the Benishoga that's available on the table.  It's made in-house and boy, is it tasty!! The Little Guy was loving it as was I! \n\nService was good - they were super attentive about making sure our water pitcher was filled and everything was fine with our lunch.

Now, what makes this special from other places in town?\n\n* FREE Photo with Santa - Yes, that's right!  They take a picture of you with Santa then and there and a 4x6 is printed out and ready to go!  Sure, you can upgrade your package for more photos but there's no sales pressure here.  In addition, they let you take pictures with your own camera without making you stand all the way across town like some of the other mall places.  Free pictures with Santa are hard to come by these days!  They even offer a Bass Pass so if the line is longer than 30 minutes, you can come back at a specified time instead of waiting in line.  However, once they are all given out for the day, that's it. (It's a similar practice to Disney's Fastpass service.)  We attempted to go on the Sunday after Thankgiving and it was a long wait, so we came back on a weekday.  No line!  Okay, two or three parties in front but that was it!  And Santa is looking pretty legit at this location...just saying.  Looks like a real beard here.  And the day we took photos, we also got a free coloring book for the Little Guy.\n\n* FREE Crafts - Every week they have free crafts for the kids to participate in.  We went during the Snowman Ornament week but the last four weeks leading up to Christmas include: Popsicle Stick Snowman, Popsicle Stick Frame, Santa Ornament, and Cookie Decorating.  They also have paper for the kids to color and write a letter to Santa.\n\n* FREE Games & Activities - They have a few Bass Pro shop appropriate games like rifle shooting and bow and arrow type games.  Again, super slow on weekdays so you can easily give it a try on those days.  \n\nOverall, we were very pleased!  Photos with Santa done and it's not even December yet!

Need I say more?\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I love a good foot rub!  And finally, Las Vegas has seen the light and is offering $20/hr foot massages!  Yes, you heard that right - $20/hr foot massages!  (What's even sweeter, you can buy 5 gift cards and get 1 free here!! Score!)\n\nBali Foot Spa is yet another place that has popped up in Vegas and smack dab in the oh so popular area of Spring Mountain.  This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.\n\nWalking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)\n\nWalking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.\n\nOverall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.\n\nSidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)  I will definitely be going back there again though because we bought the gift cards!", "type": "review", "business_id": "dfOFgjhuEp5GdHJhVzjOAA"}

We waited and waited and bam, they finally opened.  We were further pumped as friends and fellow yelpers were loving them right and left.  We decided to wait a little while since it's on the other side of town for us, and a Groupon appeared.  I thought this was a sign that we better go check them out soon.  We did attempt to go on a Monday before realizing they were closed on Mondays.  But alas, we finally made it.\n\nThe waitress/owner gave us a little pail of complimentary sweet popcorn, which was a nice treat.  She even provided a toy for the Little Guy to play with, although she didn't bother bringing a plate, napkin, or utensils for him until I requested it.\n\n* chicharron \"crisp pork belly, salsa roja, cucumber feta pico\" ($7) - When digging through this dish, I thought I found myself a huge portion of pork belly.  Imagine my disappointment when I bit into it and realized it was a tater tot.  Wtf?  The Husband thought maybe one just happened to fall into our dish, but realized that there were definitely tater tots all over.  I thought maybe they put that in as a filler because there was no mention on the menu or in anyone else's review about tater tots in this dish.  I felt this was rather misleading...why call it chicharron when there wasn't a whole lot of it there?  And looking at some of the other pics from previous diners, it looked like they got way more chicharron than we did.  We did get lots of green onion on top to cover the look. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A\n\n* lotza-mozza \"herb cheese, polenta cake, eggplant, melted tomato\" ($8) - This was a hard dish to cut up and share.  It was alright, except the polenta was more on the sweeter end than savory, which was what we were expecting. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#bKXEGe37z9Ngf51yMSUejg\n\n* pretzel brats \"chicken sausage, pretzel roll, cheese gravy, sauerkraut\" ($8) - The sausage was tough, although it was the Husband's favorite of what we ordered.  We would have liked a nicer mustard though.  I could hardly taste the sauerkraut in mine. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#LEvUquseM9C-4fp92fupfw\n\n* charred beef crostini \"coffee dusted beef, horseradish mousse, guyere baguette\" ($5.50) - I watched as the Husband went to take a bite and ended up putting the whole thing back down on the plate. The beef was way too tough to bite off and had to be cut with a knife and fork.  It was way too large to be a one bite crostini.  Other diners posted pics of getting four portions while we only got three.  They also got some sort of leafy green on theirs and we did not. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#s5_TIPie29f7oyj2M8RPBQ\n\n* statefair waffle sandwich \"waffle, vanilla ice cream, candy confetti, chocolate glaze, fun for everyone\" ($8) - I had seen photos of this from the very beginning and was stoked about getting it.  It didn't look as grand sadly enough.  We only got one waffle cut in half versus those who got 2 waffles.  We had one regular scoop of pink ice cream and a cone whereas others got more ice cream.  And there weren't any marshmallows as other pics showed.  It lacked the wow factor. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#051tAtnhzaJbOlsBSM5BNg\n\nYes, we ate it all because we were starving.  The Husband went home and had some ramen because he was still hungry but wasn't interested in ordering more here.  It was a Sunday evening and there were a handful of other parties there.  A few more did arrive during our visit.  Water glasses were huge and we got a pitcher to refill ourselves, so there was no shortage of liquid available here.\n\nI wish I had come in the beginning stages when they were more generous with their portions.  I think their food lacked consistency from what other diners got.  I understand that it's always different in the beginning and changes are bound to happen, but getting less food shouldn't be one of those changes.\n\nI do love their clean design and font.  I think the menu is pretty clear cut, and the theme is good.  But the food just wasn't there for me on this visit.\n\n2.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wL-h9AXEEMlc8A1Alo9vhg"}

I was a bit disappointed that my version didn't come with ikura as I had seen other diners receive, but it was an interesting start to our meal.\n\n* Crispy Brussel Sprouts \"brussel sprouts, lemon chili, mint, puffed rice\" ($6) - This came out rather immediately and set the tone for the rest of the meal.  (The Husband had high hopes for this dish and the result would probably reflect how much we would enjoy the rest of our dinner.)  It was good...really good.  Yes, damn good.  It was a generous amount and we were loving it.  We were delighted.  \n\n* Crudo \"sea bass, heirloom tomato, ikura, candied quinoa, lemon herb oil\" ($12) - This next course took quite awhile to come out.  It wasn't as if they were cooking anything for it, but we were twiddling our thumbs waiting.  The presentation of this dish could be as to why the wait.  The candied quinoa is definitely different as its uncooked quinoa.  The Husband only wished he had more.\n\n* Takorizo \"grilled japanese octopus, chorizo, melon, almonds, salsa verde, black olive oil\" ($16) - Again, quite a wait for this dish too.  The octopus was warm, the melon was cool.  You need to take a bite of the chorizo, melon and octopus altogether to really appreciate the sweet and salty factor.\n\n* Hotateyaki \"sea scallops, tomatillo, cauliflower, grapefruit-ginger-miso vinaigrette\" ($13) - At this point, we realized we needed a fork and knife to cut down the food as chopsticks weren't cutting it.  (Plus, most items were served in quantities of five and we are all about sharing equally here!)  Another dish that requires you to get a piece of the scallop, tomatillo, and grapefruit segment all at once.\n\n* Compressed watermelon - This was a complimentary dish, again something I had seen served with big eye tuna for other diners.  It was soaked in fish sauce, but was quite refreshing. \n\n* Sake Orenji \"atlantic salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon oil, maldon\" ($10) - It was among one of our favorites.  The salmon and orange segments were a bit large and needed to be cut down, but the sauce that it lay in along with the yuzu tobiko were delicious.  My only problem was that the tobiko would fall off the fish and into the sauce and I had to dig around to get every little morsel out.  The busboy wanted to clear my plate and I was definitely not done digging around!\n\n* Sakana Dore \"fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed\" ($15) - We were told the fish of the day was albacore and Yonaka was the only place in the Valley that had fresh albacore versus frozen albacore.  The waitress said it came from Hawai'i, so we decided to order it.  However, it came out with salmon instead of albacore.  They ended up comping this dish for us while they made a new order with albacore.  You really need to get every component of the dish into your mouth to enjoy the food.  The yuzu honey was superb!\n\n* Sakana Dore \"fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed\" ($15) - This time it came with albacore, but the Husband actually preferred the salmon version.  This version was a bit fishier, but still good nonetheless.  And we were happy to get more yuzu honey!\n\n* Shioyaki Saba \"grilled norwegian mackerel, cucumber, lemon, parsley\" ($5) - Considering they said the dishes were meant to be shared, the saba was one large piece of fish sitting on a bed of English cucumbers.  Thank goodness for our knife and fork because we needed to cut down the cucumbers to enjoy a piece with every bite of fish, which was just cooked perfectly.  We made a point of pulling the fish to the side so it didn't soak up the sauce too quickly.\n\n* Machitaki \"yellowtail tataki, asparagus, yuca chips, tomato ginger puree, soy pudding\" ($13) - This dish came highly recommended by our waitress and for good reason.  It was among one of my favorites.  The soy pudding wasn't exactly what I was expecting as its rather concentrated soy sauce and not soy like tofu.  Instead of asparagus, we got avocado, which tasted great anyway.\n\n* Chokoreto \"lime, chocolate, mint, avocado\" ($7) - A generous chocolate heavy dessert with chocolate cookie, chocolate cookie crumbles, chocolate torte/pudding, lime sorbet, and dots of mint and avocado sauce.  I think I could have used a bit more mint and avocado though.\n\nService - Ashlee, our waitress, was great - attentive and relatively knowledgeable.  The busboys were bit overanxious with trying to clear our plates, twice reaching from behind me and over my shoulder.  Water glasses were filled very quickly though!  I thought the music was a little too loud.  (And no hot water in the restroom?)  \n\nOverall, beautiful presentation with foods jumping from savory to sweet to tangy.\n\n4.5 stars and only three weeks since it's been open.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HpaYCM_NCauI72LLXxC6SA"}

It starts around 9 am and lasts until 12 pm or so. But these days, they run out of the popular food items way before noon. So come early if you want your pick!\n\nYou can trade your cash for tokens but it's really unnecessary now since all the vendors take cash directly.\n\nAmong my absolute favorites are:\n\n* Burmese Tea Salad - I love Burmese Tea Salad and I have not found one restaurant in Las Vegas that makes it. (If you know otherwise, please let me know!) The only thing is that it's not a regular item there. It's only been available a few times unfortunately. (Which makes me want it even more!)\n\n* Mango Sticky Rice - Okay, who doesn't love this Thai dessert? Sweet rice with ripe mangoes, what's not to love? However, it's a seasonal thing and they run out fast! You need to be there early to score an order.\n\n* Pad Thai - Made to order and a bargain for the amount you get!\n\n* Pork Satay - Made to order and $1/stick. Put your order in and come back to get it later on. Some months it's super tender, other months it's only okay.\n\nOther food items found:\n\n* Hainanese Chicken and Rice\n* Papaya Salad (spicy!)\n* Curry Puffs (You need to order these a month in advance!)\n* Soups\n* Chive Pancakes\n* Sweet Roti Pancakes\n* Desserts\n\nI was spoiled in the beginning because the Husband would head out and pick up the food while I slept in. It was a nice treat finding all these goodies waiting for me in the kitchen. But now it's a much longer wait to get your food because it's so crowded. Nonetheless, I'm glad the monastery is getting so much business and visitors. They could probably extend the amount of food vendors each month to accommodate the demand.\n\nSide note: Cash only.

It's located in the developing Symphony Park area, right next to the Smith Center which is nearby the Clark County Amphitheater and the North Premium Outlets.  (Keep in mind that the maps feature shows the location to be at a different place, just go to the Smith Center!)  Free parking is available all around the area.\n\nThe three stories of interactive play can keep any child's interest all day long.  Some of our favorites include the Water World, Young at Art, Fantasy Festival, The Summit, and well, just about every other exhibit!  In Water World, they provide aprons to minimize how wet your kids get, but I would still advise bringing a change of clothes with you.  There's only a limited amount available and I've seen kids drenched because they wanted to get soaked.  Even their shoes and socks can get super wet!  The Young at Art area is great for those wanting to be crafty.  It gets to be pretty messy in there and supplies start to look scarce by the afternoon.  The staff do their best to sweep and restock, but it can look like a hurricane went through the area.  There's a mini supermarket that does stay remarkably organized thanks to the staff who is in charge of that room.  The Fantasy Festival is fun, but all the costumes and props are everywhere but where you would think they would be.  Each time we had to leave the museum, we were met with very sad faces.  No child ever wants to leave, so prepare for meltdowns! \n\nIf possible, don't bring a stroller if you don't have to.

This is the ideal membership because you can bring anyone with you and we have definitely taken advantage of having this.  Visiting family and friends can benefit from this pass.  Being a member also allows you to bypass the regular guest line, which can be super long.

It also helped that they were having a Groupon promotion too.\n\nVegas Painting Parties has events at various restaurants.  You can preview their calendar to see what location works best for you and what painting you'll be doing too.  (Their usual spots are Havana Grill, Nacho Daddy, Republic Kitchen and Bar, Violas Tavern, and Streets of New York.)\n\nThis past Saturday evening, we headed to Nacho Daddy for their Red Umbrella painting party.  They use the private room in the back, so you can come early and order food and drinks.  Your dinner will arrive as you're painting, so that's a nice perk.\n\nThere were many things happening that made this venue not the most ideal spot for painting.  First off, it's pretty crowded.  Other guests commented that they had been to other painting parties where they just had more space.  I bumped into the Husband a few times while painting and he almost knocked over his water cup.  And my poor easel kept sliding and bumping into the person's canvas directly across from me.  The wait staff had to squeeze through to drop off any food for the painters.  The next problem was the air condition, or lack of.  With about 30 people in the room, it was getting hot in there and the restaurant staff really couldn't do anything about turning up the air condition.  It wasn't until after I suggested leaving the doors open to the main restaurant did we finally get some much needed cooler air into the room.  The third and probably worst problem was the lighting.  We were seated by the windows and initially opened the blinds to get some natural light.  As the sun set, you found our whole row using our cell phone flashlights to paint.  It looked ridiculous and it just was.  We asked the restaurant staff about lighting and the two fixtures behind us that resembled lamps were decorative.  Most of our phones died before the end of class.\n\nThe class itself was fun and Diane was our instructor.  She was thorough and really did everything step by step.  It was a bit hard to see her at times because of where I was seated.  She did go around with her painting so you could see up close what she did, but the poor lighting didn't help here.\n\nThe paintbrushes were okay.  There was a lot of highlighting in this particular painting and it was impossible to get our paintbrushes thin enough to make a fine line.  At the end of the night, I realized that my thin paintbrush was actually bigger than some of the others.  So, something to also pay attention for.\n\nAt the end of the class, they gave away a free painting party class good for two people.  So that was a nice ending.  They also made a point of taking pictures throughout the night and at the end with your final product (if you so desired) so they could post on their facebook site.  This three hour class was utilized to the end, and so I wonder how those two hour painting parties work.  (Someone else mentioned that this particular piece was more complicated than others she's seen, so maybe that's how.)\n\nWould we do this again? Sure! It's normally $35 per person, which appears to be the standard going rate around Vegas. I wouldn't do it at this venue again though, maybe a daytime one would be alright.  We're already signed up for another one this week at another company.\n\nErica is the owner and I communicated with her through phone and text. I wasn't able to use my Groupon before it expired and she was flexible with extending the date which I thought was awesome. I was able to book our actual date through text so that made it easy too.  Their classes do fill up, so you definitely need to check their calendar for updates.\n\nSuggestion: If you do decide to go to Nacho Daddy for the evening painting class, be sure to get there early and sit in the middle, directly underneath the main light fixture.  This will change your experience completely.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GLgoVGlx8Xm8rljtJj3MMw"}

Walking in, it's hard to not be impressed with the dramatic transformation this space has taken.  I almost felt a bit under dressed with the ornate chandelier dominating the open eating area and a bit concerned pushing my stroller in with a crying baby inside. We had our choice of seating and opted for a corner spot to minimize any distractions.  (I noticed the generous amount of high chairs available, which to me encourages a family-friendly restaurant.)\n\nWith a quick glance at the menu, we ended up just ordering appetizers.\n\n* Crispy Gnocchi \"creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts\" ($7.50) - This was good, worthy of making this a meal by ordering two. (Update! I actually did this the following week and it was too much for one person. It's pretty rich, and two orders to yourself is quite a bit. And my gnocchi wasn't as 'crispy' this time. In retrospect, 'crispy' may be a bit misleading. It's more 'browned' than 'crispy'. Nonetheless, it wasn't as 'browned' in the to go order.)\n\n* Grilled Octopus \"soy marinated\" ($7) - Three little octupi sat on the plate along with some greens.  I like grilled octopus in general, so we liked this dish.  It can be a bit daunting for those not wanting to see the head of a baby octopus.\n\n* Seared Diver Scallops \"lemon beurre blanc\" ($7.50) - I didn't realize this dish had other items on it besides scallops, so was confused by the texture in my mouth when I thought I eating scallop. I guess along with the scallops were tater tot like disks.  The sauce was a bit fruity.\n\n* Truffle Parmesan Fries \"sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce\" ($6) - It came with two dipping sauces and the chunks of garlic were falling off.\n\n* Portobello Fries \"lightly breaded\" ($6) - This also came with two dipping sauces.\n\n* Roasted Beet and Apple Salad \"arugula, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette\" ($8) - We like beet salads, but it seemed like this salad missed a little something.  They did shave some Parmesan cheese on there, but maybe it needed more nuts?\n\n* Clam Linguini \"surf clams, roasted garlic, garden herbs, Italian parsley & white wine extra virgin olive oil broth\" ($13) - We took this dish to go for my mom.  She's a big fan of clam linguine and the first thing she noticed was the amount of clams.  She gobbled up the dish and even saved the sauce for the next day.  (She said it was good, but there wasn't enough for the price.) (Update! The Husband obviously liked what he saw when we ordered this for my mom. So the following week he got an order to go!)\n\nService - The staff were attentive, perhaps even too attentive.  I appreciate more than less, so I can't complain too much.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so they were coming around a lot to ask how things were and if we wanted to order more.  The owner (one of the partners) came around to see how we were doing too. I appreciate when the owners take an active part in their new business ventures because it can show a genuine interest in their clientele, especially if they become regulars.  He mentioned that this was a family-friendly restaurant, which we do appreciate (and noticed a kids' menu available too).\n\nOverall, we like The Sparklings but are a bit confused.  It's very upscale in appearance, but a mix of casual in the menu.  I think they can actually expand on the menu a bit more, and perhaps they will with time.  But for the time being, we just couldn't find anything in the entrees that interested us.  (Items ranged from sandwiches like Philly Cheese Steak ($8.50) and Shrimp Po Boy ($8.50) to pastas, salmon and meats, ie. Rib-Eye Steak ($25) and Filet Mignon ($25).\n\nThey do offer a happy hour in the lounge/bar area from 5 pm to 10 pm daily, which means discounted drinks.

I'm not a boba fan personally, but if Will (one of the owners) is working, he will honor the BOGO special on other items! And since I'm a milkshake fan, I've been loving the opportunity to check in here!\n\nTheir specialty is their homemade ice cream...vegan flavors and Asian flavors are the standouts here. Unique flavors like ginger, durian, lychee, black sesame, and pink guava are ones that can catch your attention.  \n\nMy favorite thing to get so far is their Green Tea milkshake with almond milk. (You can choose whole milk or soy too.). However, call in advance to inquire about your favorite flavors as they tend to run out since they don't have a large back stock. (I've been there on three separate occasions and called on two different days and they were still out of the green tea ice cream.  It was very frustrating, especially for this pregnant mama who had this need!)  The Husband and Little Guy's favorite combo is the Black Raspberry milkshake with whole milk.

The Husband chose the $5.99 Mids Strawberry Shortstack which consisted of Non-Fat Yogurt, Pancakes, Strawberries, and Strawberry Syrup.\n\nThe first thing I noticed as I watched the employee pour out the shakes was how super runny it was. In retrospect, I did see the blenders before they were blended and was faintly aware that the yogurt was in a liquid form.  Ultimately, the yogurt never had a chance to set up, get cold and freeze up a bit. The machines were not prepared to handle the crowds. The staff were basically blending a liquid base along with toppings, and not for very long I might add. We ended up throwing ours out and when I poured mine down the sink, large chunks of candy were still present. The super large straws were definitely not a match for this runny shake.  We didn't bring any canned goods with us, so we couldn't take advantage of their 50% off grand opening special. That's $12 down the drain, literally.\n\nWhat made this experience even worse was the fact that the Husband got sick. He was on the toilet throughout the night and morning and even tried going to work. Alas, he came home early to continue the toilet visits in the comfort of our own home. I don't think it was the yogurt that made him sick but perhaps the pancakes were what did it.  Sadly, I don't think he'll ever want to set foot back into that place again. Too bad as I love their Three Square connection of donating a meal for every shake/smoothie purchased.\n\nThe grand opening was nice with music, face painting, and games and the staff were nice too.  Perhaps they should have stopped selling and just given out samples that were the right consistency.  Quality control wasn't there that evening and the employees should have spoke up when they saw how runny the yogurt/shakes were.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u4i6nFRAZzQIMhwh8nbVvQ"}

It was about a 30 minute wait for our party of two.  We were already invested, and decided to hold out...especially if we were going to be seated at the counter.  (This is the place you want to be seated at, by the way.)\n\nThe menu is prix fixe at $19 - you get an Amuse, a Choice of Dessert, and a Petit Four.  You can only share with another person by adding either another entree (Choice of Dessert) or an Amuse and a Petit Four.  We opted for another Choice of Dessert.  An additional $7 if you would like to do a dessert wine pairing.\n\nOne of the things I love is the attention to detail and care.  Even before we were seated, the staff are certain to make sure everything is in place before they will allow you to sit down.  The hostess was bent down on the floor sweeping with a dustpan even!\n\nBesides the obvious water bottle display as soon as you walk through the door, it's actually a wine cellar if you can believe it!  They didn't expect to get their liquor license in time, so they filled it up with the different color labeled bottles of water in the meantime.  But ultimately, it's supposed to be displaying wine. \n\nThe waitress hands us a menu wrapped up in a ring and you can immediately tell there's something different about the menu.  It's edible rice paper and a ring made from pulled sugar.  This isn't your average dessert joint.  They pour raspberry sauce for you to dip your paper in to enjoy, so don't start chomping on the paper just yet.  (We even got a new menu and ring to take home.)  Even the cutlery and water pitcher is something to take notice of.\n\n* Amuse: Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly - Our first thought about mint jelly was rack of lamb and we were a bit concerned about that.  This was far from the case.  The mint was very subtle and the mango was full of flavor.  A nice way to start our little journey.\n\n* Choice of Dessert: Marriage \"Strawberry & Banana\" - Looking at the little masterpiece in front of you, it's as if have a miniature candy showpiece has appeared.  Delicious white chocolate, flecks of gold, fresh berries, banana cream, strawberry sorbet...it's just pretty and yummy to eat.\n\n* Choice of Dessert: Apollo \"Chocolate & Raspberry Mousse\" - Another showpiece before your eyes, this time with this wonderful Earl Grey ice cream that rests on top (Oh how I wish I could order a huge bowl of that!).  Little accents like the meringue and the chocolate rice cookie squares were among my faves of the dish.\n\n* Petit Four - Chocolate molten cake with marshmallows made from passion fruit and raspberry.  I enjoyed this dessert but this third part was not the favorite of the Husband's.  He really enjoyed the other courses more.\n\nOne of the best parts about sitting at the counter is watching the actual pastry chef up front and center.  Yes, she's one of the young girls working so hard to make every dessert look absolutely beautiful.  She's straight from Japan, having only arrived in the States a couple of months ago and apparently she's been trained by some of the best.\n\nWe asked how often they plan on rotating the menu and ultimately, they said they hope to do every week.  But for now, we'll see.  They also hope to have five entrees to choose from in the Choice of Dessert section.\n\nWe also got a goodie bag with yummy desserts to take home during their opening week, so I got to enjoy Raku all week long at home.\n\nWe're liking Sweets Raku and it'll be one of those places we recommend and take out-of-town guests.  This kind of experience isn't for everyone as it's quite drawn out and there's a reason they ask, \"How was your experience?\".  (Be sure to experience the restroom too!)  If you aren't into desserts, especially ones that take time and detail, this isn't your place.  They get busy in the later evenings but are slow when they first open in the afternoon.  So come early if you don't want to wait since this place only holds about 20+ diners at a time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-k_BRFRckV7XnU76G_vK1w"}

No official large signage anywhere yet. \n\nThey have a temporary menu right now which consists of putting together your own curry plate. We went for the staple of Curry & Rice ($4.99) and added one side - Spam Katsu ($1), which is 1 slice.  You can choose your spice level as well. \n\nOur dish didn't take too long and we woofed it down. We were probably in and out within 15 minutes. There was one party of 2 there before us and a couple of singles that arrived after.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised with the curry.

Good to know for future reference.\n\nFree topping with Yelp check-in!

We did and only a handful of painters had arrived. We checked in and paid our dues ($30, plus tax, was the special arranged group rate for this Unofficial Yelp Event). We also got 1 drink coupon each, a set of 5 paintbrushes, and an apron to wear.\n\nWhile the Husband waited at the bar, I chose our seats and got the paints. I was directed to get 5 full pumps each of the 5 colors available onto a paper plate.  I noticed not everyone got these directions and some of the pumps were getting stuck. There were a lot of staff on hand though to help with this situation. \n\nThree varieties of flatbread pizza ($7) were available made to order along with a cheese and fruit plate ($6). We chose the latter to share.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was the stage set up where the instructor would be teaching from and the disco balls. There was good lighting overall. When class finally got under way at 7 pm, loud music was filling up the room. We were given the intros of Ebony, the instructor, and Jef and Caroline, her two assistants. Everyone also had headset microphones on, so that made the event quite engaging. The assistants were on hand to help out with any questions and to keep the party going. \n\nThis painting experience was different because it definitely was more of a party. The music was upbeat and relational to whatever Ebony was talking about. It was particularly helpful that she had scratch paper taped to the wall so she could show us how to paint something. The tables are lined with butcher paper, so you're encouraged to use the paper to mix colors. This particular painting seemed a bit more challenging than another I painted elsewhere and we learned more technique from this particular class. \n\nThere were mini breaks and plenty of opportunities to drink up. There was even a longer break available so you could take advantage of their free photo booth ($1 to print or free to Facebook/Twitter) and costumes. One break even had everyone up and doing the Cupid Shuffle!\n\nThey normally charge $45/per person for the teaching class, but I heard there might be a $5 locals discount. Double check that. I also noticed their calendar says the class is from 7 to 9, with registration opening at 6:30. We actually finished closer to 10 too. They have daytime open painting sessions for $25 per person as well. \n\nOverall, this was a fun experience and a great way to paint with a large group. However, it could be a bit distracting for some with the music and jokes, so it depends on what kind of painting experience you are looking for.  \n\n4.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "UEULeyxbPLYW21N1qX5ZxA"}

Add some egg pudding, which is new since their Frost Bites Shavery truck didn't have that, and some Strawberry Condensed Milk sauce! Yum!

We called the original Novecento to confirm that they were indeed open.

The Margherita pizza was $8.99 each and toppings were $1 extra each.  They come out to about 10\". We added toppings to one and kept the second one standard.  Since the staff are still training, we did notice that both pizzas came out quite different. Chef Marc came over to chat with us and he noticed our pizzas too. This is when things got exciting...\n\nHe invited us to the back to learn how to make a proper Napoletana (Neapolitan) pizza! No way! So the Husband washed up and headed into the kitchen and that's when we got a real education about this style of pizza.  I am far from an expert on pizza, but after the schooling we got, we were looking at pizza in a whole new way!\n\nHe explained how their dough is made and how long it sits, and demonstrated on how it's supposed to get pulled and stretched to just the right consistency. Then it's off to their fresh tomato sauce and the various toppings.  And a swirl of olive oil at the end is mandatory. And finally it goes into their 1000 degree oven and voila! the perfect Napoletana pizza!\n\nBut wait, there's more! You don't cut this kind of pizza! You pull the crusty edges and dip it into the tasty center where all the flavors have pooled together.  And when all the crust is gone, you get a knife and fork and eat it with utensils!!

This time, we made a point of coming for dinner because that's where all the unique offerings happened.

I really appreciate the effort.\n\nI think their lunch offerings have since changed and they are allowing you to order other things besides their basic lunch menu.  Thank goodness.  Would hate for people to judge this place based on their original lunch menu.

This particular location warrants a totally different experience although technically the product should be the same.  \n\nOne of the biggest differences is that they sell bulk items of powders, mixes, toppings, straws, etc.  It can look rather warehouse-like since it's where they keep inventory.  But if you're in the market, then it's a good thing.\n\nOn our first visit, the restroom was flooded.  Sure, that couldn't be helped and maybe a nice sign on the door advising customers that it was out of order would have sufficed.  \n\nAt this particular location, you cannot look into the ice cream case like almost all ice cream stores allow.  Therefore, you are basing your decision purely on what's listed on the menu posted rather than what looks visually appealing.  (Of course, you can ask for samples too.)  However, keep in mind that although it's posted on the menu, you still have to ask if they have it.  The menu does not reflect what they currently have in stock.  One of the things I enjoyed from their other location was their Green Tea Milkshake.  When I attempted to order it from here, they had the green tea ice cream but they were out of soy and almond milk.  So, I was stuck with regular milk.  (This ultimately meant anyone looking for a vegan milkshake was out of luck.)  They were out of a quite of few vegan ice cream flavors too, and I saw a few customers leave once they discovered this.\n\nOn our second visit, I attempted to call three times to ask about specific flavors before making the drive over.  No answer.  Were they even open?  When we arrived, they were open.  I asked the girl working what the phone number was and she had no idea.  Then she told me their phone wasn't working either. Okay. (Their credit card machine was down too.)\n\nThe restroom was working this time, but there was no toilet paper, paper towels, or soap.  Not a good sign.\n\nThe same girl was working and she was by herself again.  When she was helping my party, a guy came in and turned on the lights.  (Apparently they were off.)  He stood by the register and started flipping through the receipt book. I asked if he was the owner and he said he was the partner.  There was obviously quite a few customers waiting in line and one would think he'd jump in and help out but this was not the case.\n\nWhen I asked again about soy milk or almond milk, she said they were out.  And so I asked about regular milk and she said they were out of that too.  (I had watched her make three milkshakes already.)  So, what was she using?  Half and half.  Oh. Hmm...half and half?  At this point, I had waited so long for my milkshake I just said okay.  Well, it was a mistake.  It didn't taste the same and for someone who is lactose intolerant, it sure affected me differently.  I won't be having a milkshake made with half & half anytime soon.\n\nOther things that could use some serious improvements are how the staff are taught to rinse/wash the items.  For example, the ice cream scooper and Vitamix tamper stick were rinsed and she used her hand to 'rub it' under the water.  And watching her loose long hair hang over the deep freezer is not a good thing.  Rubber floor mats behind the counter are a necessity, especially when you can see how wet the floor is.  And ultimately, anyone running a register should know basic addition and subtraction, especially for simple transactions.  On both occasions we had to help her with transactions because she entered them into the register incorrectly.  I blame the management on the poorly trained staff, the lack of basic supplies, and the lack of teamwork.

I got a little taste, but ultimately the Husband devoured all of it.  It's a pretty good size and for someone who drank most of the soup and finished the whole pasty, he was full!\n\nI chose a Premium Pasty - the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) \"Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes.  With a side of mint-yogurt dressing or tahini.\" ($9.00)  I'm always skeptical about getting chicken breast because of how dry it can be.  This was not the case at all!  It was super moist, tons of flavor, and just really good.  I ate half knowing that I would be hurting if I even tried to finish the other half.  (I did eat the other half the next day and it was just as good! The toaster oven couldn't heat it fast enough for me!)  What I really liked about their pasty is the ratio of filling to crust.  There's a lot of delicious filling and the crust isn't excessive or dried out.  Ultimately, just really good.\n\nI took a quick peek at their dessert menu and was bummed out that I was too full to order anything.  In retrospect, perhaps I would have split one pasty so I could order a dessert pasty too.  Nonetheless, we came back about four hours later and picked up a Strawberry Pavlova \"Homemade crisp meringue shells, filled with freshly whipped cream, strawberries, kiwi fruit and grapes.  Finished with raspberry coule.\" ($6.00) to go.  It wasn't the most exciting to look at when you take it to go, but it was nice.  Next time I'm going for the Apple Caramel Pasty, Shirley Temple's Pudding, or Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding since those seem a bit more unique.\n\nThey offer a pretty extensive beer menu that had the Husband wishing he could sit awhile and have a drink.  Happy Hour is all day on Sundays from 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 12 am on the other days, which means $1 off beer and wine.  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays also offer a special on the the certain alcoholic beverages.\n\nOverall, we are liking the pasties that the Cornish Pasty Company are offering and are happy to see them in Vegas.  We only wish they weren't so far away on the other side of town from us!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4KwEzJyeuHqna7_A_eeI3g"}

So a trek this way for a sandwich must mean it's good stuff!\n\nOur first visit we got: \n\n* Foie & \"foie gras mousse, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almond\" ($9) - Rich, decadent, messy, and oh so good.  But probably best to share this one because it's a heavy sandwich for one.\n\n* Le Pig \"belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinagrette, chip bits\" ($9) - This has probably become one of our favorites as we've ordered this again.\n\n* PBB&J \"peanut butter, bacon, rosemary, pepper jelly\" ($5) - I haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in years.  Once you have this version, you won't be able to eat a regular PB&J sandwich again.  And bacon? Hello!\n\nSubsequent visits:\n\n* Span-ish \"chorizo, mortadello, manchego, olive, piquillo\" ($9) - Our picky eater, aka the Little Guy, was all over the mortadello!  As a result, he may never eat good old-fashioned bologna again!\n\n* Chicken \"provolone, bacon, wilted greens, tomato, ginger\" ($7) - The chicken was actually still in the roaster, so they suggested using pork belly in the sandwich instead.  Pork belly, when is it not tasty?\n\n* Grilled Cheese \"bread, american, bread\" ($3) - This was a pretty boring grilled cheese sandwich, it's literally just bread and cheese.  In retrospect, adding some bacon ($2) or foie gras ($4) probably would have taken this little sandwich to a whole new level.\n\nWhat I love about the Goodwich is that it's fast food, but not.  Sure, it takes a little while to get your sandwiches made but that's okay.  We put our orders in and pay and then the food gets run out to our car.  So, we love that.  And service - I cannot say enough things about how important great customer service is and these guys know this.  They make small talk, they recognize and appreciate return customers, and they are flexible.    \n\nAnd you can call or TEXT your orders in ahead of time!  How sweet is that?! \n\nThey had a Mushroom Melt on their very first day and haven't had it since.  I've been asking and so far no luck.  But they said that if enough people ask for it, it may show up again.  Help a girl out!  Ask for the Mushroom Melt!", "type": "review", "business_id": "GH9msf27EzWgoNvH8c-1FQ"}

We went late in the afternoon and now we know to go earlier. It wasn't as crowded as I expected it to me and lines weren't as long either. The Little Guy had so much fun! He was able to climb into fire trucks, ambulances, excavators, and a helicopter! Any child who loves trucks will love this hands on event. It was a great experience overall!\n\nTickets are $8 at the gate or $6 online before. Proceeds go to Family to Family connection. They do have a quiet session in the morning without all the honking for those with sensitive ears. I would suggest hearing protection for the babies if you have it.

It took over the New Day Caf\u00e9, so it was interesting to see what they did with this casual breakfast joint.  I was pleasantly surprised with how they changed the look and feel of the place.\n\nThe menu is very detailed, which makes it easy for those new to the hot pot world.  You know what you're getting upfront, so no random things in your soup show up.\n\nThe Husband and I chose to share one pot:\n\n#9 Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot \"Sliced Lamb, Sour Pickled Mustard, Daikon, Tofu, Carrot, Fish Ball, Fish Fillet, Lotus Root, Cuttlefish Ball\" ($11.99) with the waiter-recommended Minced Pork Rice (other choices are Steamed Rice or Vermicelli).  When the hot pot arrived, it looked great!  However, as we dove further in, we noticed not too much pickled mustard in the soup.  What's the point of calling it Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot if there's not much of the main ingredient present?  The server came by to shut off the fire and didn't really hear me when I suggested lowering it instead.  (Or perhaps lowering it wasn't an option?)  As a result, our soup got cold quickly.  Therefore, you don't really want to drink the broth when you're done.  The accompanying Minced Pork Rice was a really small portion and it would cost $2 more for another bowl.  We chose the medium spice level, and it wasn't too spicy.  \n\nWe also ordered the Taiwanese Pork Hocks Stew ($5.99).  Biggest mistake ever.  They were the driest and toughest ham hocks I have ever had.  The term 'stew' is misleading because it's not tender at all! I could barely pull any edible bits off and I needed some major flossing when I was done attempting to extract some meat off those things.\n\nAnother appetizer we tried was their Fried Stinky Tofu ($5.99).  Average, not really stinky or memorable.  I should mention Sweet Potato Fries ($5.99) were also on the menu - totally random in my opinion.  And I looked around, and not many people finished their order of it.\n\nOverall, Pot Tea Social House was an okay food experience.  I guess I would go back again if I was too lazy to drive down to Spring Mountain.\n\nSide note: They do have a loyalty stamp card.

With ramen (Ramen Sora) and AYCE sushi (Sushi Twister) under their belts, the owners went a different route with their newest venture in yakitori. \n\nGreeted promptly and eagerly on a recent Sunday evening, the restaurant was a third full with Japanese-speaking clientele. \n\nOur waiter was thorough and energetic with explaining the menu and there was a bit to review.  We ordered a little of everything, but let's get to my favorites first. \n\n* Crispy Chips \"Deep fried chicken skin chips with house seasoning\" ($3) - Oh. My. Gawd. This had me dancing in my seat! Fresh off the fryer with a squeeze of lemon and I am having a party in my mouth. I love deep fried chicken skin and their version just makes me so happy. As a result, we added 2 more orders. Love love love! \n\n* Yamaimo Chips \"Japanese mountain yam skin fried isobe style\" ($3) - Having only experienced this dish at one other place, we were psyched to see it here. Yum. Yum. Yum. Can I get an Amen? Oh yeah! There's a limit of 3 orders a day since they don't carry a huge quantity of mountain yams. We were more than happy to claim all 3 for ourselves.\n\n* Ika Karaage \"Deep fried squid\" ($3.50) - A tasty aioli accompanied this dish.\n\n* Skipjack Tataki Hachi Style ($6.50) - This dish came from their specials board. It's loaded with raw red onions, which may not be something for everyone. I especially liked the shiso leaf, onions, and mayo(?) combination, but it was a little too heavy-handed with the Hachi sauce.\n\n* Assorted Sashimi Bowl ($9.98) - This came with about 10 pieces of fresh fish on top of rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice and I didn't expect it to be since they don't serve any nigiri here from what I gathered. This is a great opportunity to use their special soy sauce blend made with bonito flakes, so it's a bit sweeter.\n\n* Scallop Carpaccio \"Scallop sashimi topped with masago, cherry tomatoes, micro cilantro and micro greens. Splashed with olive oil, white soy sauce, lemon yuzu, and yuzu miso sauce.\" ($9.95) - The scallop was fresh and bright, and the fish eggs were flavorful (although they seemed more like tobiko than masago). I wasn't the hugest fan of the micro cilantro and micro greens and felt the yuzu miso sauce took away from the clean flavors of the seafood.\n\n* Halibut and Sea Urchin Carpaccio \"Thinly sliced halibut topped with seared sea urchin, green onion, momiji oroshi and yuzu ponzu.\" ($12.50) - Although delicately presently, it lacked something. The flavors weren't coming out as much as we would have hoped for this dish.\n\n* Tsukune with Oroshi Ponzu ($3.50) - It's made with ground pork and was surprisingly quite juicy. Their yakitori does take awhile, so I suggest putting those orders in early. They use Binchotan charcoal (versus a gas grill or regular charcoal), which means the food grills at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Be sure to utilize their condiments, specifically the Buta miso which is made from miso and crispy pork discards.\n\n* Otsumami 3 Kinds ($5) - We received bean sprouts, squid and seaweed, and bonito flakes and veggies. It was a little uninspiring. It does change regularly though. \n\nWe tried ordering their Match soft serve, but it was unavailable. \n\nOverall, food was good. I would come back just for the Crispy Chips and Yamaimo Chips for sure. I would request light sauce or sauce on the side for the sashimi dishes, but that's my preference. I would definitely be interested to see what other specials they offer and any additions to their current menu. Service was attentive and polite. Water glasses were constantly filled and they worked as a team checking up on us. Love that.\n\nNote: They do use peanuts as their chopstick holders, so those with severe peanut allergies should be aware!", "type": "review", "business_id": "d6W_QOnt10Q84fIP0zlYIA"}
