Not when it's THIS good. \n\nIt's been said that my eyes are bigger than my stomach - and this certainly held true when I was at L'Atelier 6 months ago when I ordered the seasonal discovery menu and ate everything but one dish.

Mind you, I haven't been everywhere, but I'm confident this is where the bar is set. \n\nI love sitting at the bar and interacting with the guys behind the scenes.  Each dish that comes out from the tasting menu is magnificent.  I mean it.  Every.  Dish.  With every plate that came out, my friend just gave me this incredulous look and exclaimed that was the best he'd eaten.  Until the next dish arrived.  \n\nIn addition to the seasonal tasting menu, we added the Iberico jamon to the experience.  Aggressive adding an 11th dish -- but SO worth it. Executive Chef Steve came out to see how we were doing during this dish and even remembered me from the year prior! \n\nThe service is unparalleled. They're even good sports about taking photos of all the dishes. Including the wine pairings.  They take the time to describe each menu item and will answer any question you have.  You can tell that they take pride in their product.  As I understand it, they go through 3 months of training before they work here. As my friend put it, you can tell they legitimately love their food.  One of the guys, Sunday, told us that they're incentivized to not only enjoy the dishes themselves but to go to the gym.  \n\nCOST\ntasting menu - $155\nwine pairing - $105\n\nSome people will throw that away at a craps table with the blink of an eye -- I prefer to get something in return. L'atelier is my treat to myself. \n\nI've noticed a trend with unsatisfied yelpers who chose the 3 course $39 pre fixed menu. Fork over the money and do the tasting menu.

It was only a $10 difference.\n\nWords that come to mind when thinking of Aria:\nSleek. Modern. Technology. Comfort. Excellent Service. Tasty food. \n\nTHE ROOM\nWalking into the room, all I could do was smile. This was totally how I'd love to have my own room at home decorated in shades of brown and blue with clean lines.  I can only imagine what an actual suite here would look like if our \"normal\" room was hitting the mark.  \n\n\nTHE BED\nComfy!!! Best pillows ever. Not too firm, not too squishy and no annoying down feathers poking out! \n\nTECHNOLOGY\nlove. love. love how technologically advanced the room was. The room is controlled via remote/tv or with the lcd screen by the bed.  The home screen provides SO many options for lighting (refreshed, turn down, etc) and for the curtains.  Manage the curtains/sheers with the ease of a few buttons from the comfort of, well - wherever in the room you are. AWESOME. Don't wanna fuss with a bunch of buttons? Just press turn all off and all the lights and curtains shut off/close simultaneously.  \n\nLong are the days of awkwardly placing a Privacy sign out on the door too.  Now, you simply select the Privacy button on the screen (or Service if you need service: no, not THAT kind) and voile - the thin LCD screen outside your door illuminates in red with PRIVACY or in green with SERVICE. \n\nAt the desk, there's ports for nearly everything; your iPod/iPhone, computer, and USBs galore.  Right there in between the overpriced snacks is a box complete with every charging cord you could possibly want in case you forgot yours.  \n\nI will say this - AT&T service is spotty here at best. I mean, no internet service, no 3G - nothing. For $15 you can, after verifying your room number and name, register for internet access. Yes, I did this and was satisfied once I had my electronic leash back in tact. ;)\n\nSERVICE\nEveryone spoke perfect English. Call me old fashioned- but speaking English is a big deal to me. \n\nThe guy who came up to deliver our room service, who upon appearance you might assume wouldn't - totally did. AND he rocked at a quick set up of a table and arranging food, along with describing everything brought up - including a few extra items - as though my requests were anticipated! \n\nOn another occasion, walking back to our room - one of the service ladies (who was just outside another room) asked us how we were doing and if there was anything they could do to improve our stay, to just let them know. SO nice AND so genuine. \n\n\nTIPS\n-Looking for the plug for the hairdryer, girls? Move the tissue box! \n-Parking is comped which is nice to know if you're driving in.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JpHE7yhMS5ehA9e8WG_ETg"}

I'll post a photo -- but believe me when I tell you this passionfruit mousse looked like a damn stick of room temperature butter.  In terms of flavor, it was pretty good -- but that's after you get the idea of eating butter out of your head.  Not an easy feat. \n\nThe best part of the meal?

We put our name in and were told it'd be a 20-30 minute wait. They take your phone number so they can call to tell you -- only I had HORRIBLE reception inside the Cosmo, so I missed the call and returned to the front desk about 10 minutes after they called.  We were seated immediately, which was great.  While perusing the menu, some bacon/cheddar infused popcorn came out in a little metal pail, courtesy of the chef.  \n\nThere were so many burgers to choose from. We chose the big fat Greek burger and the surf and turf mini-burgers.  Thankfully, we had decided to share because the Greek burger was THE best burger I think I may have ever eaten.  I'm drooling a little bit just thinking about it. Lamb, tatziki, red onion, feta cream... bursting with flavor.  The surf and turf mini-burgers were just meh even with the bearnaise sace. \n\nNow, the most shocking part of the menu wasn't their amazing beer selections or even the bamboozled milkshakes -- but that their \"fat\" fries (as I call them) were GOOD. If you follow me on here at all, you know that I have a strong aversion to anything but shoestring fries for the fry/flavor ratio.  These were perfectly seasoned; I definitely snuck more than a couple from my friends plate. hehe\n\nBased on the service we received -- I'd suggest not being in a rush to get anywhere or in the mood to order something additional. The girls sitting next to us waited for easy 20 minutes before the server came over to give them their bill after asking for it and then there was a discrepancy.  Only after another 15, they didn't want to wait anymore to deal with it and just called it a loss.  When it came time for us to order another drink, our server was no where to be found.  It was almost a joke. \n\nSo why would I go here again?  That Greek burger. Seriously - amazing.

Though, not sure why it says dressy, it's definitely a more business casual/trendy vibe. \n\nWHAT a find! Definitely off the beaten path, but a cheap cab ride (from city center) to a pretty great meal, vintage decor and a terrific bunch of people. A touch of class and personality in Vegas. \n\nDon't be surprised if people can't find it and make jokes about Drew Barrymore when you ask where it is. As soon as you turn right onto Convention Center Drive, it'll be on your right hand side almost immediately. \n\nFor lunch, we started with the lobster mac and cheese. Now, I'm lactose intolerant -- but I will have you know, if I didn't have anywhere else to go that day, I would've eaten it all! YUM.  I opted for the lobster roll and my friend chose the burger. Both were the perfect serving size and tasty. We also enjoyed the signature Barrymore drink which was concocted from Gentleman Jack (which I usually dislike) orange marmalade believe it or not and some other ingredients. Don't judge! It was lunch in Vegas -- cocktails are acceptable this early ;)\n\nAfter speaking with the manager, it turns out they do dinner up pretty big as well. Jerome (I think) runs a tight ship and really pays attention to cleanliness.  \n  \nWhile sitting at the bar after lunch to finish my cocktail, I met Monica who was really chill, friendly and helpful. Behind the bar is a custom made TV within a vintage looking gold frame. When the tv isn't on -- it's a mirror.  There's a couple of these inside. I totally want one for inside the house. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink next (since now we were in full swing of conversation and my previous glass was empty) when I asked if she had a few particular items to make my self-created cocktail, the Hendy.  She executed perfectly and the manager agreed it was the epitome of the perfect summer drink.  I truly hope to see it on the menu then  :)\n\nWe also met Billy, the owner, who also owns Holsteins in the Cosmo.  (where we ended up for lunch the following day). Turns out the bottomless bloody Mary I was eying, the Hillbilly, which uses beef brisket infused vodka, is named after him. Can't say I tried it -- but had I been there for brunch, I certainly would. \n\nOverall -- this new spot is definitely one I'll continue to visit when I'm in Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Gvw2ewUbqq7PWkxKwjqifA"}
