While deciding on our entree, the server brought an awesome spread of complimentary guacamole, bean dip, salsa, and chips. We decided on the sizzling fajita platter, which is more than enough for two. It was divine!  The margarita on the rocks was great too. Our server was awesome! I will definitely return if I stay at the South Point again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xl5w8jkI_9uhR10qGncH9A"}
