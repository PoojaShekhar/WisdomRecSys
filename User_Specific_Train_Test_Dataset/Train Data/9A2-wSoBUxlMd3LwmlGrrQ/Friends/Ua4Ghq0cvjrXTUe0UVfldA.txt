Poolside bottle service, strip clubs, gambling and what? A Neon Sign Museum. Yes, you heard that right. A Neon Sign Museum.\n\nYou know how when you fall in love, you can visualize that moment so clearly in your head? It's a flutter, this overwhelming desire and then certain details just sit with you forever burned into your long term memory.\n\nNo? Ok, maybe that's just me. *awkward pause*\n\nAnyhoo, 5 years ago I had come home from work, picked up the mail and was doing my normal process of file, shred, and read when I come across my monthly VIA Magazine which I always peruse through to look for the next adventure to add to my ever growing list. Start flipping through to see a brief clip of the Neon Museum. My eyes ate up these deliciously worn down and repurposed signs. They were visually stunning even in print and it was love at first sight.\n\nLuckily this year I had a conference to attend in Vegas, and I was determined to go during one of the nights, even if I have to go it alone. One of the promises I made to myself this year is \"Imma do me\" and to check off as many things on the bucket list as possible and not give myself excuses as why something can't be done, or needs to wait. Float a Neon Sign Museum visit by some coworkers, and receive stunned looks of \"I'll pass *cough* you're a nerd\", before folks agree to go. I love the people that humor me on my completely random adventures. I immediately book tickets 3 months in advance online.\n\nWe grab a cab and oddly enough to head off strip at this hour to the location is about 40 mins in rush hour traffic and we'll miss our timed tour (pre-booked this months in advance ONLINE, not that the place is every really that busy). Calling the museum I only to get caught up in their IVR and get frustrated. My cohort proceeds to laugh at me and then tries the number for himself, of course he managed to bypass the IVR and reach a person without much effort. He gets our situation sorted to where we can join the tour a little late. It's the little moments like these with friends where I think to myself, \"I'm lucky to have you around,\" and with a brief mind hug, I look out the window and am distracted by signs.\n\nWe arrive shortly and are escorted to the tour, already in session. As the other visitors listen to the history and descriptions, I completely ignore the guide and physically skip around, lingering near the back of the pack so I can get the perfect shots sans humanoid forms. Sometimes I don't think I care what the story was before coming into contact with something beautiful, I just care that it exists in my view, for me to interact with, add my own personal metadata, love, and appreciate. After all, isn't it our memories that make things special?", "type": "review", "business_id": "zuqsWG_FamUP3FQnL49Q4Q"}

It is kind of amazing inside.\n\nWe get there late and find that they have given up our room. Ok so we're off to a poor start, the front desk tries to ask us to pay for an upgrade to another room, but hello this is not our fault, so with that reasoning we get bumped up. \n\nWe walk in and it is an astonishing view. Our room on the 50th floor faces the golf course and the beautiful waterfall behind it. The room is stunning with floor to ceiling windows and decorative mirrors. The shades are drawn by buttons in the middle console next to the beds. Not only are there 2 queen beds, there are two sinks and a vanity. There's a LCD in the bathroom, plasma in the main room and the alarm clock is an iHome iPod player that can charge our iPhones with. The room is amazing.\n\nDownstairs there are several late dining facilities and stores that open till midnight and serve drinks like mimosas and sparkling wine while you peruse the products. I get giddy just thinking about how nice it was. \n\nThe staff and promoters here were also very helpful. Being guests there we had instant access to the club, which opens up onto their outdoor waterfall. While the music was subpar which I find with many Vegas clubs the view was fabulous and the drinks were good.\n\nI had an amazing time staying here. It doesn't matter that it's at the end of the strip, it's just one of the nicest places to stay and besides we took cabs everywhere we went so who cares about walking around?", "type": "review", "business_id": "u9wjRhUjySkHPa_hG3kFOg"}

He says it was vodka, but I think it was rubbing alcohol. Needless to say I guess I was disinfected through and through. \n\nThen the guy's friend asks \"Hey we've been waiting a long time. What took you guys so long.\"\n\nSeeing my friend dead silent, I decided to be nice and try to answer, after all they have just provided us with a cleansing. \"Oh we just flew in, I hope you weren't waiting too long were you?\"\n\n\"I've been waiting all my life for you to come along.\"\n\nThat's when I basically laugh in his face. \"Seriously? You really tried to use that line? Really?\" \n\n\"Well I had to try it.\"\n\n\"Oh no, you really didn't.\" I continue to laugh, and he disappears not so mysteriously back into the crowd. \n\nApparently I've been told Lindsay Lohan frequents here. I can't see why. The music is TERRIBLE, with dead stops in the middle of the sets, and very poor song selection. Then the lowlifes there think that if they buy you drinks you have do pony up something, and most are too drunk to notice that they haven't supplied drinks, so then lots of shoving was required on my part. I would rather buy my own drink than to talk to people who are shady shade.\n\nNevertheless I still had fun because of the company I was with. Best nerd moment ever was when a friend busted out the iPhone and spun it like how you'd spin a glow stick. I was cracking up so hard. That's what made this worth it. The people I went with, and that they have air cond full blast in the desert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lP83pY2HLmsff1VfVoyw-w"}

Since our dinners were taking a bit of time, we also had an amuse bouche courtesy of the chef. It was a similar tuna appetizer. \n\nFor main course, I ordered the 22oz bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye. It was cooked to perfection. The only thing I didn't like was that they don't really let you have it your way. I like my steak a little more rare, but they suggest that you have it medium, as that is the chef recommendation. Nevertheless, the medium was good. \n\nI polished the whole thing down and then... for sides there was the roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime and cotija. This by far is THE BEST THING on the menu. While we got other sides... we only really finished this one and were licking the bottom of the bowl it came in.\n\nFor dessert we had some delicious churros and a cake that I can't remember now. But the churros really stood out. \n\nOverall a great tasty experience. I would go back for the corn alone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

We wandered around for a while before we found it.

Good sparkling wine with peach puree. It was brunch, but my like minded ladies wanted to try the oysters here and they were the quality kind, not too oversized and lacking that fishy flavor.\n\nThen between us we ordered the croque madame, french toast, and the piece de la resistance... chicken and waffles! Can you believe Bouchon has a version of chicken and waffles? I blinked twice in disbelief looking at this menu item. \n\nEverything was not bad, and the service was impeccable. The runny egg on the croque madame was cooked to perfection, neither being too runny or too over cooked. The french toast came in a mini tower much to our surprise. We split it delightfully and the chicken and waffles, while not being fried chicken was roasted to a great savory moistness mixed with the sweet syrup and spongy waffle was a great \n\nAlso sitting outside on the patio right by the pool was fabulous, except for the fact that only older people sunbathe outside during brunch time... *shudder*", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Seriously, it is like the best feast for your eyes. In every way this could be a place out of a movie. The cool and trendy Asian fusion inspired place where a major scene occurs. \n\nBut the thing is, you can't enjoy it at all. The line outside is insane, there must have been 1000 people in line when we got there at 11:30pm. Then we managed to cut the line due to the \"finesse\" of some guys we met in the casino. As soon as you get in, you are literally shoulder to shoulder with someone. I guess I'm lucky to be decently tall for an Asian girl, otherwise I might have suffocated in shoulders. Not only that, they totally skimp on the air cond. I mean seriously, Vegas is HOT, the only reason to go clubbing in Vegas, vs the normal home town is that you expect the eye candy to be better and to finally by graced by the presence of being cooled from the heat. But it was cooler outside the club in the middle of summer that is how hot it was. It was so dark and crowded I couldn't make out any candy. Then the dance floor was packed, literally the only thing one could try to do to dance is jump up and down. \n\nLame. The one thing was that the drinks were ok, but drinks can pretty much be ok anywhere you go. I would totally pass on Tao, if it weren't so pretty inside and the music wasn't decent, which it was, I would have given it one star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PqTX5j9yfsPbd1qQCA1EwA"}

Grounding up Kobe beef is not how one should have it... if that even was Kobe beef. I think the only reason we all enjoyed it was because we were so hungry. \n\nNext was a little bit of salad. Split amongst 10 hungry girls were 3 plates of salad...\n\nThen came the Yellowtail Sashimi which was this absolutely delicious piece of thin yellowtail in this jalapeno ponzo sauce. \n\nBut the thing that all made it worth it was the Sea Bass, served over risotto, with baby shrimp and topped off by lobster broth. It was totally moist and delightful. \n\nFor dessert there was fried macaroni and cheese and donuts. Can I say, since when does donut = fancy restaurant dessert. Obviously the chef was getting lazy when he got to the dessert menu. And usually that's the best part. We were so full however that we happily skipped the donuts and mac & cheese.\n\n2 stars for the seafood items alone!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1nO6ffHEwZYFBzEsyw1w7w"}

Prime rib, meh, sashimi, decent, oysters meh, crab legs also decent. But the gelato here was the best part.

I could have gotten us two rooms each with 2 queen beds for the holiday pricing I paid, elsewhere. \n\nAnd no, we didn't over pack the room, we have 4 people total. 2 on one bed, 1 on another and now one on the floor/couch.
