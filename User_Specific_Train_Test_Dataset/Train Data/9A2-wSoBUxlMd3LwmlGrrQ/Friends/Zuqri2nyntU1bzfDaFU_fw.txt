I spend about 10% of my personal workout time cleaning up after other guest. pulling the weights that they left on the bars, so I can use it, wiping down sweaty disgusting equipment, searching for weights left on the floor.

I have seen photos, it is not pretty!\n\nSo...we asked our server what he could have on the menu, and the server cheerfully boasted \"Honey, 99% of that menu has wheat in it! You can have a salad and that is about it\" Then told us most restaurants don't have gluten free items here in Las Vegas....OK, we will agree to disagree. And wish there were more gluten free options on this menu.\n\nOnce we got over that moment, we ordered some food. (Yes my friend had a salad, no dressing because we were told they make salad dressing with wheat as well) \n\nHe had a steak salad and tuna tartar, hold the soy sauce on the tartar. I had the sausage pesto pasta and it was awesome! \n\nOverall we had a great time, now I really want to go back and sit in the dining room. Which is beautiful BTW!

We pulled up into the Valet, to go have dinner, and see a show in the hotel. Only to be turned away. \"Hotel Guests ONLY\" - I understand. I did not like it, but I understand. Why not simply put up a sign?? Driving into the Strip is already a hassle, driving way back into the Linq Valet also a hassle and we were late due to traffic. Great start to a night out, and then made even later, because the Linq cannot be bothered to have a sign letting people know there is no Valet for anybody but registered guests. Just a simple sign? Is it hard, Really?\n\nThe quad around the Linq, that is another story. What an awesome spot to go hang out, and play! We love it!

They did not seem to make a difference between indoor and out door dining with reservations, it is just where there is a an open table. We sat out side under a heater, which was fine for us.

Usually service here in LV is far above average, but once in a while you get a service person on the strip who treats you like \"Hey your a tourist, I will probably never see you again. So, you get mediocre service\" - Unfortunately, this was my first experience sitting at the bar at Yardbirds, and I am a local who frequents the places that I love. The bartender seemed overwhelmed with his 10+ customers, clearly not able to multi task, and generally was pretty blas\u00e9 about customer service. And towards the end of our visit, there was a shift change which was also apparently much more important than checking in with us, or taking our money. Leaving the restaurant, we were not even thanked by the 3 hostess chatting amongst themselves as we walked by. Needless to say, I was far from impressed with the service aspect of the evening. I REALLY hope the dining room is a better experience! I will try one more time and see.\n\nWe did receive some great beverages, I will not lie. I had a simple lemonade and it was fantastic. My friend had a Moscow Mule, and said it was good as well. We order a few things from the app menu. The stand out for me was the Farmers Cheese with watermelon. So simple, and fresh just a perfect little bite!! The least favorite were the deviled eggs, and not for lack of flavor, because that was there!

The sound system vibrated the seats! YES!!! So much fun! I will seriously consider the IMAX Screen for new blockbuster movies!\n\nAs for regular movies, it is perfect. Never really crowded, easy to get in and out from. And the bonus is there is a good food court right outside of the theater, or any one of the other fantastic Red Rock restaurants right there too!\n\nA few insider tips....\n-Tickets are reduced ALL DAY on Tuesday! Only $6 for a regular movie!!\n-They also give discounts for AARP Members, Seniors and I think Vets\n-If you are driving, the Self Parking lot closest to 215 is the answer. Go to the back corner, there is an elevator that zips right down to the bowling alley, and you do not need to walk through the smokey casino!", "type": "review", "business_id": "krJt8oc1s_HCp5XuEKpTXw"}

And I wish I was exaggerating! We had to wash our clothes when we got home. It was disgusting.\n\nWe ordered the sashimi salad, which had a picture in the menu that looked tasty! Seasonal greens topped with a yummy selection of thick fresh sashimi. What we got was a fist full of iceberg lettuce and some paper thin slices tossed on with out care, dressing on the side. The good part, the dressing was actually pretty good!\n\nWe had some confusion on the sushi, we ordered one special roll, and received another. Our waitress told us it was a typo on the menu, and that the right name was on another roll a few down......ummmmm OK. We got that worked out, still not very good, sadly. Neither were the other rolls we ordered.\n\nI sat wondering, how can this place have all these 5 star reviews? What are we missing? Or are we hitting a bad night? Then I look over and see a sign on the table that stated \"with your great Yelp review, you get a free beverage and a complimentary tea cup to take home.\" \nOK... so I guess a lot of people needed the free drink? Or the tea cup?? Am I the only one that finds this a bit odd? Coercing good reviews for free schwag?\n\nRegardless, we will probably not go back.

The sauce had some delicious creamy heat!\n\n-Roasted Cauliflower - The dates were the best part, the cauliflower was fine but a tiny bit blah in the flavor department.\n\n-Mac & Cheese - Truffleliscious! It was really awesome, the smoked bacon was a great add.\n\n-Street Corn - I loved it! a bit too citrusy for other peeps on the table, so I ate theirs! YUM!\n\n-Gnudi - Very tasty!\n\nWe all decided we would happily go back any time!

And I love the bison burgers, I go back and forth on the jicama fries or the tofu fries, they are both so good, in completely different ways. The egg dishes are light, and tasty. I have never had a smoothie from here, but I see them making them like crazy, so I assume they are a local favorite.\n\nThere is a reason why this company has different locations popping up around the city.\nOnce people discover it, they love it!

The space is cute, the staff is friendly. \nWe hung out for a little over an hour, then moved on.\n\nOne of the best part of the new space, it was not smokey when I was there. And I did see people smoking! I hope that means their smoke machines are top of the line, because that alone would get me there a bit more often!\n\nTough town to be Clean & Sober in! I tried to order a non-alcoholic beer from the bar, nope. Then a bottle of bobbly water, nope again. I settled on a cranberry juice and soda water.  Since I don't drink I cannot speak on the cost or strength of the drinks. \n\nI was excited to learn that they have a backyard patio, but when I went out it not so excited to actually see it. It looks more like a cafe with rows on 2 top tables. Very sterile and not conducive to socializing. I guess I was hoping to see cute little sitting areas, maybe even a fire pit or two. The insides are so sexy, I was hoping for the same outside....not yet. \n\nOver-all, I think this place has huge potential! The location is easy, the place is clean and comfortable, the staff is friendly. It is just waiting to be discovered!", "type": "review", "business_id": "KLd41gemAj0dJCVGX8929g"}
