As soon as I saw the menu here, I started (favorably) comparing it to Miller's on Polk Street in SF, where I first had matzo ball soup.\n\nThe soup here, which we started with, is just as legit. And the portions are just as huge, too- the one pictured is a cup. It could easily be a lunch, and is served with a couple of tasty-ass bagel chips too. Rye flavor, natch.\n\nBF opted for one of the most expensive (and largest) sandwiches ever, the JR Boucher, which is a triple-layer with pastrami and liver. Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels. Oh and one sandwich is easily like three meals. We shared it and still had half for dinner.\n\nAnd, because I'm a total glutton and never on this side of town, I had to get my own dish, too. I got the Ceily's stack- latkes stuffed with brisket, topped with two types of cheese and brown gravy. It's even more amazing than it sounds, priced at $12, and is also easily split into thirds. Just finished my order for lunch today.\n\nWith two heavy take-out boxes in hand, we rolled ourselves out the door... And promptly axed any plans of looking for a rental property in Henderson, because I don't want to weigh 400 pounds and if this place were nearby, that might be a serious possibility.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NfdZgoNTGsfth9MS8Qaurg"}

Acidity of the green sauce brightened up the flavor.\nThe LENGUA IN SALSA was to die for. No kidding, the sauce of tomatoes and onions and potatoes is heavenly, the perfect south American comfort food. The lengua itself was a plentiful portion, stewed to just the right texture and doneness that it fell apart beautifully.\nThe CHULETAS dish was also a gigantic portion, and the green sauce came in handy here as well, keeping the dish from becoming boring. Speaking of boring, most people don't consider rice to be all that exciting. The rice here is perfect: fluffy, light, warm, and flavorful, rather than just filler. I generally stay away from or go light on carbs, and this rice had me sneaking bites until it was all gone. Chuleta was served with a side salad, which came with several tomato wedges and nearly an entire lime- all very fresh!\nSide of YUCCA- this version was nice and crispy like very thick steak fries, but I prefer them with a stronger garlic seasoning to them.

They were willing to make me a take-out order just before closing, and were quite polite. Crab is real crab, not imitation krab mix, which was a nice change of pace and unexpected given my assumptions about the location.\n\nThe Not-So-Good:\nLocated in a run-down plaza anchored (if you can even say that) by Jimmy Johns and little else, exterior is not at all inviting. Menu features about an equal division of traditional rolls, about a third baked/fried, and variations of the California roll. Found sushi menu fairly boring and (again, based on my expectations given the exterior) overpriced. Majority of rolls other than simple maki-style were over $10, and they were small. \n\nOrdered a California roll and a Rimba roll (scallop, crab, cream cheese)- rolls were very similar, given that they both had crab. Scallop was minimal, but crab was fresh and genuine. But I didn't expect to spend $16 (including tip) on just crab, and such small portions at that.\n\nAfter placing my order, noticed DS#5 (dinner special #5) in the regular menu, that looked like a much better value: two pieces each tuna, yellowtail, and salmon nigiri, plus a California roll, and soup, for $16. Sounded like a better deal but felt it was too late to change my order, especially being that they were at closing time. \n\nHighly suggest they move to another location, and either lower their prices or up their roll sizes. Keep friendly staff and clean, traditional d\u00e9cor scheme. Also consider increasing hours- they are closed Sunday and only open til 9PM other days, which is fairly early. No business at 8:30 on a Friday night, not sure how they turn a profit. Then again, maybe that's why the prices are so high.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ocZ8pz-8iSz5avdPKnoalA"}

They also have a chicken gorgonzola dish that is pretty bomb.\n\nRecently they've added a fresh juice section- today I grabbed a bottle of carrot juice, also available in organic for about a buck more. I may have to go back and stock up.\n\nLots of snackable foods in the rest of the store, from cracker-cut cheeses and goat cheese samplers in dairy, to more varieties of tortilla and pita chips than you can shake a stick at (including the pumpkin seed and cranberry variety that I love!). Refrigerated cases have just about every hummus under the sun (eggplant is my favorite), and of course there's the wine section as well.\n\nTJ's three buck Chuck in the Cab is good, but I don't think I've ever gone wrong blindly picking from the aisles either. There's a sparkling red that's good too, I think it's by Romano vinyards? No clue, but it's delish and $5, which might narrow down your search.

I felt rushed, but asked about the paint issue. Her brusque response was a short, \"Your frames are old and wearing out.\" She again thanked me, clearly done interacting. I was the only customer.\n\nFor nearly $50 for a very small repair, the arm is back on my frames and that's about it. The screw wasn't put in tight, so the arms are still quite flimsy, defeating the point of having them repaired.

Discrepancy with the menu though, which states that dinner specials are 7-10PM. Either way, they were down to only well-done prime rib by 9PM, so I guess that's the day you're supposed to get there at 7 exactly or just cross your fingers.\n\nGood bar for a game, plenty of beers and lots of screens. LIked the cozy booths and the variety of seating options available. Don't know if they offer more game day specials for appetizers, but the prices were a little high, IMO.\n\nI went for the chili and side salad combo: $10; BF opted for a burger with a side of homemade chips and a beer, $10. Total came to about $25, so not bad all together, but I felt it was overpriced for what it was. BF would likely only return for late night menu pricing.\n\nSalad was nothing to write home about, dressing was bottled and not particularly flavorful (bleu cheese). Chili was surprisingly bland despite being drenched in cheese and onions. Not sure how they managed that one. Had high hopes considering it's made with black beans and sirloin, but it seemed like it was old. Later that night I had a stomach ache, lesson learned.\n\nBF's burger had swiss, bacon, and grilled onions, though I can't remember the name.

Chips were impressive in that they were superthin and waffle-cut: no clue how that happens, and it was cool, but they were also overly greasy and lacked crunch, and weren't particularly flavorful.

In my haste to find a roll with salmon, I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the fact that there was tempura shrimp AND (way too much) cream cheese AND (sweet) coconut in this roll. Verdict: again, not my thing. Very sweet and creamy roll, bearing little to no similarity to sushi. The sweetness and the cheese covered up any fish taste.\nSeaweed salad was flavored appropriately but dismally small: whoever packed my order accidentally put the salad in the lid rather than the bottom of the container, and space was limited.\n\nDisappointed to have a negative experience at a place so many friends and Elites love and have reviewed favorably.

Fish was fresh, rolls were tight, portion was large. NY Girl in Vegas roll was also good, topped with noticeably smaller pieces of eel compared to the other roll.

We started out with one waitress who was polite but rarely around- it seemed she was the only one working, so we cut her some slack. Then after the first quarter, she started getting really pushy about dropping off the check and constantly checking to see if we had paid yet, even though there were hours left in the game.\nFinally she straight up told us we had to pay so she could leave- now, if she'd just told us that from the start, in a friendly manner, I would have been totally cool with closing out early and tipping her early on. But she very obviously just wanted to go home and did not give a crap about stopping by to check on us until it affected her pay.  \n\nAs it is, the pizza was tasty but even they run on the small side- pay attention to the inches (M, 10\") rather than the actual size (M, L, etc). We tried the Fellini and it was flavorful and loaded with toppings (salami, sausage, olives, bell peppers), and with the special it was priced well- I don't think I would pay full price for this pizza.\nAlso had an order of the \"award winning\" wings, medium heat- should have gone for hot because they didn't have any heat to them. Large order, good flavor, but not sure how this is the best in town.\nBF had a few beers- once he realized how watered-down they were though, he switched to domestic.\n\nThe second server we got was much sweeter and more of a people person- an older woman with red hair. Felt bad that we'd already ordered everything we were hungry/thirsty for, but left a tip simply because she was so much better at her job: checked up on us regularly, was very friendly.\n\nHeads up, this bar allows smoking indoors- not a bad thing on it's own,  but I'm not a fan. Luckily, only a couple of people smoked a cigarette or two while we were there. Was a little grossed out to see an employee smoking at the end of the bar, but I'll assume it was during her break.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G2AqHSVc8t6I21qiHeq7jA"}

There's a panaderia next door and a paleteria further down the strip center to continue your Mexicano dining adventure!\n\nTHE NOT-SO-GOOD NEWS: Apparently prices have gone up from most of the ones posted on these reviews. Tacos are $1.25-$1.50 each, my two-taco take-out order was basically $3. But when I opened the bag at home, there was a foil packet roughly the size of a slice of cheese. I wondered how they could have given me the wrong order, given that I was one of only two orders at the time.\n\nTHE REALITY: My two tacos were both mini-tacos, and the condiment container of grilled onions I'd grabbed at the salsa bar seemed to dwarf the actual tacos. I know street tacos are on corn tortillas and run a smidge smaller at traditional places than, say, Taco Bell or Del Taco, but these were absurdly small.\nSimilarly-priced tacos at Tacos Gil or the guys on Decatur are all easily twice the size of what I received here. Key words: similarly-priced. \n\nThat being said, the lengua taco is fairly good and I liked the mild salsa verde, but the asada was lacking and overpowered by the ranchero-style sauce included when you ask for \"everything on it\". \n\nTHE VERDICT: Disappointing.

Like other reviewers, I too expected this place to be equivalent to McDonald's take on \"authentic Greek food\". Oh how wrong I was.\n\nGYRO SLIDER- a baby gyro, complete with tomato and onion, and a cup of the famously delicious cucumber cream sauce. It's about five bites, the perfect size for a large snack, or just grab two for a meal. Meat is overflowing and tender, just the right light amount of veggies to add balance, all wrapped in warm pita. Yeah, I used the entire cup of cucumber sauce on this little thing. And loved it all.\nSPANAKOPITA- about $4 and easily the largest piece of spanakopita I've ever had, even comparing it to more formal sit-down restaurants. Well-priced for good value, and on top of that, it's freaking delicious: light flaky phyllo dough, tons of creamy feta cheese and spinach stuffing, very indulgent. This could be a meal in itself.\nBAKLAVA- at $2, the price is on par with others in the area for this dessert. But it's two or three times the size of the \"usual\" orders elsewhere, and it tastes homemade with an extra kick of some sort of seasoning/spice to make it unique, though I can't place my finger on what it is; allspice or clove. Oh, and it's proportionally accurate with a good amount of filling, rather than being mostly flaky dough, as I've had elsewhere.\nGREEK SALAD- I don't like the way it's packaged and how it consists entirely of iceberg lettuce, but their feta dressing is probably my favorite salad dressing ever.\n\nI regularly hit the drive thru here for a midday snack or to grab an easy and cheap dinner. Food is always fresh, prices are really good, quality is higher than any other place I've been with a drive-thru.\n\nEDIT: Dropping my rating. They no longer offer the spinach pie and if you order a gyro slider, they are now served on crappy store-bought flatbread rather than the fresh mini-pitas they used to use.

Plenty of booths, and I was downright surprised to see tables of families with eerily silent kids- kids entirely focused on devouring their food. That's downright unusual, and I knew I was in for something special.\n\nThe ribs we ordered saucy, at the cashier's suggestion, despite his mention that the dry-rub style sell better. I love a good sauce, and theirs was spot on! Not to spicy, not too sweet, but good balance and robust flavor that complemented the char of the chicken as well as the meaty ribs. BF and I picked off of one another's plates but the obvious was that I should have gone for a second meat plate rather than a wrap.\n\nThe mozzarella wrap was large and tasty, and served as an excellent vehicle for that amazing garlic ranch sauce they have, but the taste of the cold chicken was more subdued and the grill-fresh char flavor was rendered almost absent. It's a good healthy-ish option though, but I might opt for a salad instead next time.\n\nAs for the sides? The saffron rice was moist and flavorful, and the mac was solid- not dry, not overly cheesy and saucy, but a good version worth having on the menu that doesn't feel too heavy or contrast too sharply with the other major menu offerings. \n\nAttentive and helpful service, damn good chicken and ribs, AND a Yelp deal to offset the price?

Portion for price wasn't as great of a value as I had anticipated.\n\nWor Won Ton Soup was incredibly disappointing. Takeout container is packed with tons of chicken, some shrimp, and a lot of fresh produce, and the won ton skins held up well. But the broth is unforgivably weak and flavorless! \n\nRice To Go (cheesy name and all) is a far better option for quick, takeout Chinese with better selection and quality, get thee to Decatur & Spring Mountain instead.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7VDrYNPhDKFURZbK4MRi8w"}

If you've ever had Jamaican Caribbean food before, this place is not going to hit the spot. The majority of four and five star reviews are from people who don't know any better.\n\nI shop frequently at the nearby Sprouts grocery, and always mean to stop in here.\nBF picked up takeout last night for dinner, and said the restaurant smelled heavenly and took it as a good sign that all of the employees were actually Jamaican.\n\nGot home, and as others have said, takeout dishes are splashed everywhere- sauce out of the box and in the bag, one napkin and fork for two orders (and placed UNDER the takeout boxes in the bag in the puddle of spilled sauce), etc- little details that may slightly irritate, but not be relevant for dine-in customers.\n\nBut the food, despite smelling so good, was simply mediocre. All spice and no depth of flavor. Ordered the jerk chicken plate and the goat curry- and you could tell that both meats were indeed chicken and goat, but the similarities between the high quality versions of these dishes we've had elsewhere and what we actually received, was sad.\n\nThe jerk chicken was, for starters, dry. Rub seemed to be applied sparingly, and there was only flavor where you got seasoning. Good portion, but not necessarily good value. \nGoat curry sauce had a good consistency to it, and the meat was good, but the flavor was simply lacking- lacking depth, lacking that finger-licking jamaican flavor I'd come for. \nSides included a mixed veggie type dish that was overcooked mush, and \"rice and red beans\" consisting mostly of rice and of a few scant red beans (I counted maybe 10) that appeared to be dried. When even your sides are underwhelming, there's a problem in the kitchen.\n\nThis was one of those rare times when the BF and I didn't finish our orders. And for about $30 for a week night take out dinner, that's pretty bad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "93zReBgrXHZxsONq6JtEzQ"}

If the store brand were a band that went on tour, I'd be right up with the rest of them, throwing my panties on stage.\n\nBut this location is a little odd. It's right across from Koreatown and when we went around 4PM there were literally seventeen cars in the parking lot. So if you want to avoid a crowd, this might be the one to go to.\n\nHowever, what is missing in customers is also missing in staff and selection. Store layout is a little odd, and the first thing you see when you walk in is the little food court area- which zero people went to while we were there. The store also lacks a produce department- they would probably increase their customers if they replaced the snack stand with a fresh produce area. But that's my completely unprofessional opinion.\n\nUsually I can spend my weight in cash on the women's fashion department, but here nothing was styled or really on display and nothing caught my eye- a rarity for Target stores.\n\nFound the basic items we needed, at prices we expect for this chain, but was just underwhelmed.

Don't believe the hype.\n\nBF is a huge prime rib fan, and when I stumbled across this place i thought I'd struck gold and found a Monday night that fit our schedules to bring him in for a surprise date night. And my carefully-laid plans bombed.\n\nPlaced his order for the prime rib special with mashed potatoes, bummed to hear it does not come with a vegetable despite many mentions in other reviews and pictures here of a veggie side. Waitress told us a side would set us back $2- for bar veggies? No thanks. My order was for the 10oz NY, which did come with a veggie, mashed potatoes as a side as well. Both of us added on a side salad for $1 extra, with bleu cheese dressing.\n\nNow, if the first element of your meal is a side salad, and you are unable to finish it, that's probably a bad sign. The salad itself was fine and decently fresh but the dressing had seen better days- it neither smelled nor tasted like and bleu cheese dressing I've ever had in my life, and we couldn't put our finger on whether it was supposed to be a yogurt-based ranch dressing, or if it was spoiled.\nWaitress cleared our still-full salad bowls in confusion, and when we mentioned that the dressing was off/funky, all she had to say was, \"Well it came straight from the bottle.\" Um, then maybe check the expiration date on that bottle.\n\nThen our entrees were brought out. BF's rare prime rib was medium rare only in the middle, and easily 1/3rd of it was fat while another 1/3rd of it appeared to be brown in color and possibly spoiled.  It tasted like more of a roast than any prime rib I've ever had.\nMy steak also had a good 1/3rd of the meat consisting of fat, and not even just around the edges of the steak itself but globs of fat within the middle of the steak- very, very low quality meat. I know my expectations for bar food are low, but come on ...\n\nFor a $30 meal, we literally ate about 1/5 of his prime rib (we were put off by the rest of it), and maybe 2/3rd of my steak, plus the broccoli and potatoes. Not really the value it's advertised as.\nOn top of that, we barely made it to the car before our stomachs started hurting.\n\nTo end on a positive note, our waitress was super friendly and sweet, though I'm a little perturbed that she didn't offer a solution or even begin to address the quality issues with our meal. That being said, she's a server and not a manager or in charge of who is selected as a supplier, so she's not really the one to discuss those matters with any way. Considering we had maybe five bites of our salads, I expected them to be removed from our bill- even if it was only a measley $2.\n\nOnly redeeming factor of our meal was the beer my BF ordered- it was a JW Dundee Nut Brown Ale and it was delicious.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qy7DyCFqyTPDctp_H1n-Pw"}

Add in that this place is about a mile from home for me, and that it's 24 hours, and it's pretty much kismet that I would finally come here and actually really like it.\n\nFirst off, its a bit  pricier than expected: spent $25 on dinner for me and the BF.\nAs others have said though, the sandwiches are beyond huge enough to share.  We got the #32 peppers and onions cheesesteak with provolone ($11), added on sides of chili cheese fries ($4) and an order of wings (10 for $8), and a Franks black cherry soda ($2).  For the price, the sandwich and wings were good portions. I didn't think the same thing about the soda or fries though- but then again, I'm not a soda person in the first place, though I understand this brand is apparently something special.\n\nThe sandwich itself, in addition to being huge, was stuffed full of meat and veggies. The cheese was a little light for my liking, and it was slightly on the dry side toward the ends of the sandwich, but it was good. In the future, I'd probably stick to the mushroom one though.\nThe chili cheese fries were fairly standard and a smaller portion than I expected but we still devoured them in record time. The wings, though, were a surprise. I ordered the mild ones rather than hot, and still found these to be surprisingly spicy. I'd definitely hesitate before ordering their \"flamin'\" style, I can't imagine how much hotter they must get. Portion was good for the price, wings were an average size without being too small or overly fried or breaded. Huge portion of ranch for dipping. I liked how easily the meat came off the bone, too. A little less messy than usual. \n\nWe ate at the patio area, and it was noisy and difficult to carry on conversation, as others have said. However, it wasn't a total turn off and in fact kind of added to the experience. I'll have to come back and try the sweet potato fries...and the breakfast sandwiches... maybe I'll add the Whiz next time, too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MLPEpxih9E8NySHbM0FSWQ"}

Not too greasy, four piece order for $8. \nDUCK NOODLE SOUP: Duck plus noodles, in a savory brown soup with cilantro and bean sprouts. The best and worst part was the broth, which was extremely rich and flavorful, but entirely too greasy to enjoy the entire portion. \nKING & I FRIED RICE: Fried rice with the usual mix of meats (shrimp, chicken, bbq pork) and the addition of pineapple and cashews. The last two ingredients made me hesitant to order this, but they made the dish! The nuts added a nice texture and the citrus helped cut the excess oil. Menu describes this as spicy and I didn't detect any heat at all, added in an entire cup of chili oil and it was just right.\n\nIt's small, and nicely decorated- definitely a neighborhood kind of spot, I really enjoy the ambiance. Opted for a large takeout order, flavors were good and prices were fair.  Unfortunately, the excessive oil/grease used in a few of our dishes turns me off to coming here  frequently, but it's a solid option for rice and noodle dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5cybURsCTS0zHH5Qbu0sDQ"}

Dishes are made fresh, so expect a reasonable 8-10 minute wait time in the comfort of your vehicle.\n\nOn first visit, I ordered #4 (3 piece \"snackbox\" of fried catfish plus hush puppies and fries), a side of gumbo ($5 for a small portion), and the fried green tomatoes appetizer ($3 for 6 slices, seasonal availability). Total meal was about $15, not bad for what would ultimately be 2 meals for me.\n\nWas pleasantly surprised by quality- fish was freshly fried, batter didn't fall off, wasn't too greasy and oil didn't taste old. Fries were a bit on the soggy side but had good flavor, seemed to have a touch of batter to them. Hush puppies were weird, didn't eat them- strange oblong shape and no flavor. Disappointed that the 3 piece order was served with only one tiny cup of tartar sauce- it was tasty,  wished there was more. Portion for price (meal is about $6) was good, didn't come close to finishing.\n\nNow for the real surprises- the GUMBO and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.\nThe gumbo was a small portion for the price but packed with sausage and crawfish. Flavor was on par with Weeziana's, just up the street, but her pricing for portion is  better ($10 gets you a tureen!).\nFried green tomatoes were delish- batter was different from what the fish is breaded in and more mild, and they're served with a delightful dipping sauce.

The chicken was well seasoned, flavorful and moist, the mashed potatoes were better than your grandmas and went perfect with the chicken. The veggies were steamed with a delicious seasoning blend and weren't soggy or overlooked at all.\nOh and the French onion soup? It's the best I've ever had.

Called in my order for takeout and headed on over. Upon entering, saw that the restaurant itself was a bit nicer and more upscale than I expected. Service was a bit lackluster- waited for a bit at the door before being acknowledged, my boxed food was waiting at a table with a manager-looking guy who brought over my receipt and took my card with a series of gestures, then ran my card and disappeared without a thank you or asking if I needed anything else. \nThat probably explains why I didn't get any utensils or napkins, nor did I add on another side or additional naan as I'd originally planned. And there were only two tables seated at 5:30PM so it's not because they were busy.\n\nI found this place to be a bit pricey. \nI like that half-size entrees are available for a slightly-lesser fee, but found that the decrease in pricing (usually around $3) isn't worth the decrease in product. Lesson learned. For three half-size entrees, one container of rice was provided. Also ordered one garlic naan. Total was around $40, which is a bit steep. I always have difficulty paying so high for a la carte indian food when the buffet prices are so cheap for so much. I feel like there's a discrepancy there that should result in lower prices rather than higher, but whatever.\n\nQuality made my entree choices worthwhile: saag paneer, baingan bharta, and lamb korma. The saag was decent but I prefer mine a little saucier, this one was a lot of spinach and good-sized cubes of paneer but the dish seemed as if it hadnt been cooked down long enough. Best eaten with the garlic naan, which was fragrant and delicious.\nBaingan bharta was ordered exclusively based on recommendations here on Yelp, and I was not disappointed. It was flavorful and I appreciated that the sauce was on the thicker side, which allowed for it to go well with the rice. \nThe lamb korma is the only dish that had any spice to it whatsoever, and it was quite mild despite ordering a 5/10- at Thai restaurants, that'll get you a spicy dish, but I guess Indian is a little more laid back with the scale. I know now for next time. Dish didn't have quite as much lamb as expected for a $10 portion.\n\nSpeaking of portions, I was a little confused by the portions and packing of my takeout.\nI appreciated that the half-size entree portions were packed in plastic lidded containers and wrapped in plastic to ensure that nothing spilled. But the size of the portions themselves were on the small side- think the smallest hummus containers at the grocery. That size. \n\nGoing to put this on the list to try again for the lunch buffet, thinking that will be a better value and possibly a better overall experience. Good quality, vast menu of options including several vegetarian dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gkWEjZIVcrUerEzed6IKpg"}

The customer service here was deplorable! \nIn addition to being painfully slow, no attempt whatsoever was made to explain, apologize, or in any way acknowledge the growing line of vocally unhappy customers. As a result, more and more people left the line and went to get cars elsewhere, cancelling their reservations for free by phone due to the situation. I was nearly at this point, but the line didn't take so long after half of the people left- however, it was still at least an hour of standing.\n\nWhat was most irritating about this place, was that besides putting the slowest possible employees on register, there were other employees present who did not get on and help! There were 17 computers at the counter (yes, I counted) and again, only TWO people working, despite an original line of TWENTY people. \nThroughout the wait, THREE other employees (two older white guys and one lady) came out from the back and helped the two register-bound employees with a problem, but only one (the lady) ever got on and helped out herself. And even then, she assisted one person, then me, before leaving to \"go pick up a customer service call\" in the back. I don't know if she was the manager or what, but when we asked, her explanation for the delay was that five people didn't show up. I want to note here that she gave an explanation, but not an apology, which would have been easy enough to do considering the whole situation.\n\nAlso, please note that even if you reserve with Hotwire or some other service, it is not until the very end of your transaction, almost as an afterthought, that the employee mentions that there is a THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR HOLD on your card for the use of the car, as a \"deposit\". I have never, EVER, had a deposit fee that astronomical, not even to rent an apartment. Thankfully I was able to do so on the card I'd selected, but had it been a check card I would not have been comfortable with the situation, and it was very unprofessional to try to sneak in this requirement at the last minute.\n\nLuckily the car worked just fine, and checking in was a lot faster, but the initial customer service (or lack thereof) that we received completely put me off of using this rental service again.\nAlso, I want to note that other reviews here as well as other people in line stated that this particular counter is ALWAYS understaffed, so it seems doubtful that the \"five people didn't show up\" excuse is even true. Upon turning the car back in after our rental, this counter again had the longest line (though shorter this time) and still only one or two employees working. I don't understand how it's possible to be consistently short-staffed when every person in line had made reservations to pick up a car with a specific TIME AND DATE.\n\nShort version: it may be cheap, but it's not worth it.

The walnut brownie pot bread was sweet, but no overwhelmingly chocolatey or nutty- the name had made me expect more of a dessert on the table, but it wasn't overkill.\n\nService, as others have said, rocks.

If it's not carts, the absurdly long line to the tax/banking business will block you, too.\n\nAnd prices are hella high here, unless you're deliberately going in for featured items in their circular- how on earth they're charging $12 for a bottle of McCormick's ground cloves, I have no idea. I went in to get it for a recipe and left without it, those are highway robbery prices. Up to twice the price for produce, too.\n\nBut sometimes you'll luck out and find $3 off stickers on their butcher packages of chicken thighs, bringing them down to sane pricing. Their boneless skinless chicken breasts regularly get put down to $1.49/pound, too, which is good to look out for.\n\nOn the bright side, staff tends to be on the friendly side and the self-checkout is nearly always open.\n\nUltimately I'll still shop here, since it's on my route to/from work and they tend to have good specials- but I exercise caution when picking up items that aren't on sale.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rbcco9u9YO6jnaZtv7RIPw"}

Tables are initially served a breadbasket with three mismatched breads, and a tray of olives and two tapenades- the green is best.\n\nCHARCUTERIE BOARD: two types of tasty cheeses (one was a blue), two types of meat (salami and prosciutto?), dates, candied walnuts, and crisps. Wish I could tell you what type of cheese it was, but all dishes were presented without any sort of explanation or comment.\nFOIE GRAS: served with fresh fig (singular), port reduction (gross), and truffle crema (tastless, certainly no truffle here). Served without any sort of crackers or bread, and our breadbasket was empty and no one ever refilled it.  Did not care for the texture, flavors seemed off. Would have shared this with my server, but we never saw him.\n\nBRICK OVEN ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN: served with a potato cake and green means, all amid a sea of tasty jus, but the chicken itself was bland. Recurring issue with dishes here. Again, even just salt would have helped this dish.\nBONE-IN NY STRIP SPECIAL: served with green beans and fingerling potatoes, steak was plated with a giant puddle of some sort of cabernet sauce? Guess it was meant to hide the fact that the meat was flavorless aside from gobs of fat in every bite, and unseasoned to the point that it desperately needed salt. No char or sear at all. \n\nMUSHROOM RISOTTO: decent-ish side, mediocre version of a favorite dish. The table ate the entire portion though.\nCRISPY ZUCCHINI: no menu description, expected a roasted version but received a plate of tempura zuke covered with cheese. Hard not to like that but odd considering the rest of the menu. \n\nAs you can see, we had issues with the service. The restaurant wasn't that busy, yet we rarely saw our server. Literally went 20 minutes wanting a martini that I couldn't order because he never came by. When he did, he didn't seem to care at all. We were asked what we wanted to drink, what we wanted to order, and if we had any questions- no intro, no script, no explanation of specials, devoid of personality. Didn't even ask to see a dessert menu because we were so put off by the flavorless food and nonexistent service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KjymOs12Mpy0Kd54b7T9MA"}

They seem to pride themselves on not being a tourist destination, but let's get real: very few people come here more than once for anything but the novelty.\n\nConsidering half of Texas, where I'm from, was settled by Germans, the food here did not live up to my expectations given the price point- but we have few restaurants turning out this cuisine here, so some inflation is to be expected.\n$60 dinner for two, splitting a plate, an app, and a beer? Not really worth it, IMO. Quality was just not there for the majority of the items.\n\nKartoffelpuffer - Two crisp and golden brown Potato Pancakes served with smoked Salmon and traditional garnish; it's like going to a Jewish deli for breakfast and being torn between the pancakes and the lox, and deciding to combine them. Not bad, but pancakes aren't seasoned at all.  $15\n\nSpecial Plate of the Day- pork loin served with two kinds of sausage, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, sided with gravy and mustard. Sausages weren't bad, one was considerably better than the other. Pork was unremarkable, as were the 'kraut and 'taters. $20\n\nThe beer. Good lord, I have no idea which beer my guy opted for, but we got the 36oz stein and it was huge but we drank it all without problem because it was light, smooth, and delicious. Complemented the sausages, as it's supposed to. HB prides itself on only importing beers that meet the traditional purity law, with simple, classic ingredients only. Mad hops, I mean props, to their beer! $16\n\nThe reason I can't tell you which sausage was the best is because service is mostly nonexistent. I guess if your basic couple is likely to spend $100, and most people tip 20%, you don't have to do much to get halfway decent pay by default.\nOur waitress took our order, kitchen staff brought it out and took it away, waitress brought our bill. The end. Gave us a vague and rushed \"you good?\" as she walked by once, but otherwise did the bare minimum.\nThere was a featured dessert trio, but only one sounded appealing. Disappointed that they are unable to accommodate an order for a single dessert without spending $15 on the bunch of them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ES-j5yNTgmgbL4He0h6otA"}

Maybe some consider that a bad sign, but as we dined business picked up.\n\nCame using a BOGO Groupon- all you can eat and all you can drink for two for $46. Not bad at all. Pricing was not available online to see what locals prices were or which deal was better, but gave it a shot. The $11.50 extra for all you can drink option is not something I'd pay to add on in the future- BF and I each had two drinks (beer and champagne, respectively) and did not feel it was worth it.\n\nFood is divided up by cuisine style:\nSeafood- snow crab legs and shrimp plentiful, but disappointed with sushi. Very little was out and it was all dry and falling apart as if it was left over from lunch or the day before. Was never restocked during our visit. Only consisted of simple cucumber, salmon and california rolls. Avocado in the CA roll was brown, ew. You'd think with crab and shrimp available, there would be a better selection.\n\nSalad- loved the wedge salads available, haven't seen that many places!\nSoups- only chicken noodle and tortilla were available, didn't look appetizing.\n\nItalian- pastas all looked as if they'd been sitting out, but meatball was tasty. I'm mostly avoiding carbs, so I did not really spend much time in this area.\n\nChinese- very generic, did not have anything here.\n\nBarbecue- BF enjoyed the prime rib, yukon gold mashed potatoes were delicious, barbecue pork shank was tasty! Despite signage for sliders, only fried chicken kept being put out. It was tasty but not my thing.\n\nDessert- Tons of cupcakes. Not sure why they're so large, seems wasteful as most people are only taking a bite or two and trying other flavors. Someone probably needs to rethink this.\n\nMid-Eastern- grilled veggies, chicken and lamb were all good, tabouli and naan flavorful, lamb tagine was surprisingly true to flavor.\n\nMexican- Like the Italian area, disappointing. All food was very basic and appeared to have been sitting out.\n\nSalad- lots of cheeses, breads, and spreads available here. Opted for a lot of fresh fruit and got a wedge of brie with some fruity bread, very tasty.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SLyacGZuMUKqrQJEooSkjw"}

I like how you are able to immediately pick up a plate and start assembling your salad as soon as you walk in, and that there are two sides to the salad bar itself- made things move quite quickly.\nOr at least that was the intention. There seemed to be some sort of issue with the cashier on our side disappearing, and an employee stocking silverware had to hop on register at the last minute but her login was not going through- luckily, the cashier on the other side (Jarra?) came to the rescue and began attending to both sides of the buffet line and alternating transactions with her register. Way to step up!\n\nThe salad bar portion started with a few premade featured salad options, then had all the ingredients, add-ons, and dressings to fix up your own. BF and I did a little of each. You're able to customize to make your meal as healthy or unhealthy as you want- I really try to stay away from the premade versions as they general are over-dressed and have more caloric ingredients.\n\nOnce you are seated, you can then add on soup options. Tomato soup was delicious,  cream of mushroom was a super-fresh featured flavor, and the clam chowder was very flavorful. The black bean chili had surprising depth of flavor but didn't really suit me, nor did the chicken noodle chunk.\n\nThe baked potato bar, pasta options, and dessert area are very limited- which for us was a good thing, as we could not really be tempted and could focus on the healthy meals we came here for. Lots of breads though- add a stick or two to the bottom of your soup bowl, especially the garlic bread + tomato soup combo.\n\nService at the table was surprisingly attentive about clearing dishes, asking if there was anything we needed, and generally maintaining a productive and positive attitude throughout the dinner rush time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JcttlqJIusjo82_pxpz6oQ"}

Other than the odd vents in the locker room, this place didn't seem to have central air or any fans, which I found pretty odd.\nAll in all, not bad for a vacation gym, but simply not at all up to the Golds Gym standard as I've experienced it elsewhere, so plan accordingly.

A lot of the reviews I'd read before coming stated how the price did not reflect the experience- at $18/adult, i'm not sure I disagree.\n\nThis aquarium reminded me of the Dallas state aquarium, in that it had a creative use of space that involved more of an outdoor feel with an Amazon-warrior theme for their open area, and that they were able to incorporate animals aside from fish. The first thing you see when you go in is a crocodile, then a komodo dragon and a tank of cichiids, before getting to some amazon fish and some lizards. Information on conservation is scattered throughout. Several large tanks are toward the end of your tour, and there are several informational plaques and computer displays set up for perusal. \n\nMy favorite part was by far the tunnel, and I probably spent a good 15 minutes in there. Many families and other visitors passed me by quite frequently, which may be why the price is seen as \"too high\"- they rush through and it's over and done with pretty fast. I will admit that it is small though- despite my lingering and genuine fascination with the exhibits, I was in and out in under an hour, probably closer to 45 minutes. \n\nThe room after the tunnel has a touch tank of rays, which is always fun. As an educator, I like when museums and aquariums incorporate hands-on aspects for kids and adults rather than just things to see or read and a strict directive to keep hands off. The experience could be improved with more video rather than plaques, and perhaps more marketing geared toward adults rather than children, as they didn't seem to be engaged in much aside from the tanks at their level. \n\nThe giant shark tank at the end of the tour, with the shipwreck decor, was a little overdone. It was cool to see the sharks and all, but with the name \"SHARK reef aquarium\" it was a little underwhelming. I had expected to see more sharks in the smaller tanks rather than just one or two culminating in the large room of sharks. Also, the tank itself was virtually empty of any decor- whether this is an oversight (it seemed boring to me) or simply best for visibility or the sharks' preference, I couldn't say. \n\nI'm not usually a gift shop person, but given that my admission was covered by that polite family, I stopped in. Sadly there wasn't too much selection in the way of adult shirts- one or two with gaudy lettering/stupid phrases, but mostly cheesy water-print tees featuring a shark mouth on the front circa 1990. Saw a lot of cuter kids tees but nothing in a size that would have worked for me. Other than shirt selection, there was a lot of kid-friendly type stuff, which again contrasted with the lack of kid-centric display materials in the exhibit itself. \n\nPretty decent aquarium considering it's in a casino. Worth a visit if you aren't annoyed by the price, but definitely plan to linger. Watching the jellies, fish tunnel, and octopus are good places for this.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NBFu9Ia-KzpsByWtoB6JhA"}

It's not the best museum I've ever been to, and it's not particularly child-friendly, but it's affiliated with the Smithsonian and especially relevant to Vegas considering all of this atomic research was conducted close by.\n\nWhen I say it's not a child-friendly museum, it's because the set up is information heavy and consists of reading large chunks of writing, repeatedly. It's kind of overload. Before I was even half way through, I was just skimming. Few of the sections had interactive components- because no, having a screen with five different videos to pick from isn't what I call interactive.\n\nThe part I most enjoyed was the time line: it showed popular events in pop culture, world history, and in atomic testing, all on the same diagram so you could see what events were happening at the same time as others.\n\nOn thing I didn't care for was the inclusion of random canvases of art: someone with a paintbrush and some talent made a series of paintings depicting people during the time of atomic testing in various contemporary scenes. All included a small tag with the work's name and sale price. I found this tacky. Sell things inside the museum store, not inside the museum itself.\n\nLast couple of exhibits were related to south western Indian tribes, advances in technology, and a modern major events in history: with a chunk of the Berlin wall and one of the beams from the World Trade Center 9/11.", "type": "review", "business_id": "k5WjMttOP6rL61yEsAuPgA"}

Upon seeing the prices/selection, I almost left to try the buffet instead, figuring I'd spend about the same amount, but I'm bad with portion control and figured the quality would probably be less, so I stayed.\n\nIt wasn't particularly busy, and despite the name and decor had a distinctly diner-esque feel to it, for some reason. They had a seafood special going on, so I opted for the $7 ceviche appetizer and was decently surprised at the portion- though more tortilla chips could have been served with it. Glass contained about 2 cups, mixed shrimp and scallops, and was alright. It would have been more appropriate served with lime slices rather than lemon, but the taste wasn't bad and the fish was clearly fresh. I know it's all about presentation, but eating the ceviche out of a wine glass and attempting to spoon it onto tortilla chips is a clumsy affair and would have been better suited to a lower stemmed bowl of some sort. \nNot sure why I ordered the chicken burrito for my entree- I can have Mexican food at home, right? But I was in a cheese-craving mood and didn't like the idea of spending $10 on a plate of nachos (though maybe that would have been a better choice), so I went with the overpriced burrito plate. At the very least it is a large quantity of food. Beans were slightly off and rice was overly wet and bland, and the burrito itself, while large and stuffed with chicken, wasn't particularly flavorful. Used up a lot of the pico, salsa, sour cream, and guac just trying to eat about half of it without simply choking down shredded chicken. \n\nIn any case, the staff were very polite though not very present/available. In my case, that was a good thing, because I was lingering there for just over an hour with my food and a glass of wine, waiting for my friend to arrive as our rooms were in his name. That being said, it was bizarre to have so many other servers come by so frequently but never see my own- and never have anyone offer to fill my water glass.

I will say that I liked the clear boxes storing the produce in the wall sections, it made the department look cleaner and more organized than usual.\n\nFound the clearance section in the small hall between the meat and bakery departments along the back wall- everything maxes out at half off, and most of the selection is niche-market goods that are typically overpriced in the first place (gluten-free chocolate chunk cookie mix, miniature salted chocolate bars for original price $5, etc), but right across is a freezer section with some clearance items too- snagged a pint of frozen vanilla greek yogurt for $2, nice!\n\nThe cat food/litter aisle was priced similarly to Smith's, which is another way of saying overpriced unless you go for the ghetto bottom-shelf bagged variety.

She pushed it, which was a little irritating- as a manager, I know there is a way to simply swipe a store card and move on.

Arrived on time and pulled up as instructed, only to sit there for five minutes without being acknowledged by the woman standing just inside at the register. At first I thought maybe she didn't see me, but several people walked up and talked to her, and made eye contact with me and a comment to her. Generally I expect to be acknowledged when I'm waiting, even if it's just to say sorry it'll be a couple of minutes- I prefer that over being ignored by far.\n\nGot home with my dishes, good portions for lunch pricing- $8/per person.\nPad thai was a large portion of noodles, chicken was a little on the dry side, dish was a little spicier than expected for a 3 but reasonable. Curry was a 4, which was quite spicy and BF did not care for the spice level but the veggies were fresh and the beef was a good portion. Appreciated that the rice was fresh and fluffy, offset the spiciness of the curry. Both dishes served with a wonton and spring roll- tasty and not overly crispy.\n\nWould swing by to take advantage of lunch pricing again, but after all the hype I simply felt the product wasn't amazing but rather just average.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HsAYzU2-Z_vZAaRqHbcP8g"}

After visiting, I can confirm, it is the kind of food you can get fat on.\n\nLocation is easy to miss if you aren't familiar with the plaza- I've driven past the intersection countless times but didn't know it was here. Parking can be difficult to find due to other busy businesses nearby. This place rocks a giant but empty patio which would probably be better utilized as additional parking spaces.\n\nOrdered a fat gyro and athens fries. The fat gyro is no joke, the name of this sandwich is as honest as the name of the restaurant: it's enormous and was two solid meals for me. The chewy, soft pita pilllowed a plentiful portion of moist and flavorful gyro meat, topped with tzatziki sauce and feta, and supplemented with lettuce and tomato. From the first bite to about the middle of the 'ro, it is amazing: flavors complement one another in a classic way that is key to a good gyro. Then you realize how full you are and the debate between having fries and saving the other half, or forcing yourself to finish, kicks in.\nI opted to resis the urge, but was underwhelmed by the fries: I went at an odd time between lunch and dinner and expected the fries to be made fresh but they tasted like they'd been sitting out a while and were a bizarre combination of dry and flavorless. That being said, the cheese atop them was a generous amount, and the portion was a good value for the $3 price tag. However, I'm just not cool with the idea that I need to add several shakes of salt to a heap of cheese and fries to make them palatable. \n\nIf you choose to stuff yourself with gyro instead of opting for a side, I won't judge you. But I will judge you if you follow that up with another meal later in the day because, Lord, that's a lot of food! If you opt to save it for later, as I did, consider taking the lettuce and tomato out so that you can heat it up without getting nasty warm produce when you reheat in your morning daze. Also consider removing the layer of foil beneath your leftover fries so as not to reenact the microwave-fire scene from American Hustle.

Managed to snag a last-minute reservation on a whim, but by the time we left I was almost irritated with the overall experience.\nThe appetizers we selected were awesome, the pasta we shared was terrific, but everything after that was extremely underwhelming. Best advice is to sit at the bar, order apps and some pastas to share, or do the tasting menu. \n\nStarted with a complimentary CHICKPEA BRUSCHETTA that was interesting but not something I'd suggest they add to the menu any time soon.\nPORK TROTTER ALLA MILANESE with Roasted Tomato and Cannellini Bean Vinaigrette (BF's favorite) and WARM LAMB'S TONGUE with Chanterelle Mushrooms and a 3-Minute Egg (my favorite)- both really good, would get again.\n\nShared the HOMEMADE ORECCHETTE with Spicy Lamb Sausage and Rapini, which was very nice. The pasta was perfectly fresh and chewy, the lamb and rapini paired well together, and the sauce didn't overwhelm the other ingredients.  Made me wish I'd just ordered different pasta dishes instead of meat-based entrees.\n\nRABBIT PORCHETTA with Peperonata, Sunflower Sprouts and Crispy Confit was underwhelming and slightly overcooked. Wasn't wowed by this at all.\nGRILLED PORK CHOP with Kuri Kuri Squash, Apples in \"Agrodolce\" and Green Walnut: I'm not a fan of pork chops and apple sauce, but this upscale version worked. The chop was flavorful, fatty, and salty but the squash and apples mellowed it out well. Wouldn't get this again, though, this isn't really what I'm coming to a Batali restaurant for.\n\nLastly, we ended with the TIRAMISU with espresso gelato: BF's pick as I didn't want dessert at all. We received the plate with the gelato already mostly melted, forming a puddle of soup. I would have taken a picture of the travesty, but wanted to get at least a single bite. Not impressed at all.\nReceived a complimentary dessert sampler of bite-size goodies like meringue and biscotti: these nibbles were better than the dessert we actually ordered, which somehow just made me more irritated about spending $14 on melted gelato.\n\nADDITIONAL DETAILS: I suggest sitting at the bar because the dining room tables are so close together and the majority of the smaller tables for couples are alongside the open wall by the walkway. The passing traffic was so noisy that I couldn't comfortably carry on conversation even before parties were seated on either side of us. After that? Forget it, everything had to be repeated several times.\nThe service, while knowledgeable, was not personable. Whatever.\nEverything ordered after the pasta was mediocre, and the fact that half of my dessert was melted when it reached me is an oversight I don't expect when dining at a restaurant of this caliber.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rNahhyqDlouyDMHh57p3ug"}

And once you make it inside, there's really only room for about four people to be in the building at one time- there are chairs and counters along the perimeter of the dining area for those who want to dine in, but there really isn't a way for people standing in line to NOT constantly bump into the seated diners. Bad floor plan.\n\nService was crappy and borderline nonexistent- I was asked what I wanted, and if I wanted it toasted, and if I wanted veggies, and then told my total. Employee was female and young and rude. After paying for my order, she handed me my receipt and walked off- no thank you or good bye, and she didn't even hand me my sandwich, which was practically behind the register. Awkward.\n\nAdd to this that there are several signs up promoting their jalapeno cheese bread, and they were out of it when I went in-- at noon on a Sunday. On top of that, when I finally ate my sandwich, there was hardly any meat on it and it was clumped in the middle with bites of bread and veggies at either end- of a six inch. \nTried the chicken enchilada sandwich and it was underwhelming. I'm confident that I had around seven Fritos in the entire sandwich, and I am not sure whether she forgot to include sauce on my sandwich or chose not to put it on- because it was really dry.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m9xE2lgdgtfV-yrpuGQy5g"}

Salad was large, but underwhelming- should have opted for a specialty salad, as the mix of iceberg lettuce and peppers with a mostly-straight-olive-oil Italian dressing just didn't really do it for me. It's well-priced for a large portion at $5, and may be much better simply with a different dressing.\n\nWas pleasantly surprised by the pizza- was expecting the kind of by-the-slice stuff that has likely sat out, but my piece was fresh, cheesy, and featured giant pepperonis. The crust was also well-seasoned with a garlicky blend that I really enjoyed, and the sauce was a very savory chunky tomato version that was heartier than what I usually find on pizza.

Falafel plate with hommos and salad ($10) is also an ample portion, and each plate comes with their own fresh, warm pita.\n\nShwarma is turkey, per the menu notes, but sliced and grilled fresh with good flavor. Falafel is crisp, hommos is creamy and topped with olive oil and parsley, and the salad is legit: fresh lettuce and cabbage, topped with tiny-chopped tomato, onion, and cucumber, and doused with a good amount of tahini dressing.There's no feta, but that probably carries over from the kosher dishes. I added some myself at home for extra oomph!\n\nThey also have burekas- small square pastries stuffed with potato, spinach, or mushroom; the latter is my favorite, highly recommend.\n\nSide tangent: Not sure why this place hypes up falafel as healthy.

I had a hell of a time finding the place and missed it more than once.\n\nThe menu is fairly simple, with apps, soups, Chinese dishes, and bahn mi-style sandwiches, as well as boba- all vegetarian or vegan, the boba beverages made with soy milk. Prices are low, service is friendly, and the only real downside is the cash-only policy, which I always forget about (or else I'd be by more frequently).\n\nThe crispy \"chicken\" and avocado sandwich is pretty solid- heads up that it's heaped with tons of shredded carrot, which can overwhelm the other flavors at times. The bread is also not the freshest, openly kept in the refrigerator by the front counter. But the flavors inside the sandwich? They work, and not in a way that obviously betrays the fake nature of the \"meat\".\n\nAnother fave is the Vietnamese handrolls- the pork skin version gets a lot of praise from in other reviews, but I stick to the beef, which has a surprisingly believable texture, even if the roll itself is a bit heavy on the noodles and lighter on the herbs and veggies than I'd like.\n\nService is quick.

The ahi was a generous portion for $10, perfectly seared, and I enjoyed the tamari soy sauce but did not care at all for the wasabi cream.

Subbing carne asada adds on $2. But the best (and most expensive) thing you can add to your burrito is queso sauce... Except it's an insane $3 fee. So your deluxe delicious breakfast burrito, with a side of potatoes (because a duvet-sized tortilla simply isn't enough carbs for one meal) will set you back nearly $20 with tax and tip. Frankly, I can't justify or afford that, but if you can, by all means contact me to be your personal assistant.\n\nSeriously though, the proportion of egg to bean to bacon in the regular burrito is perfect, the pico adds an awesome bit of freshness and acidity, and the queso makes it a next-level contender for one of the best I've had. But only a captive audience will pay that kind of price, and they damn sure won't be happy about the bill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hsTKn-6YSH3JsOSiYKGkwQ"}

I wouldn't have even known about this place if I hadn't seen a poster advertising their 4 courses for $48 deal in the Venetian elevator. It's a good price for a lot of food, most of it quite good. \n\nFIRST COURSE\nFLAME-ROASTED MARROW BONES: $11 for three giant bones. This was a great start t our meal, with the gelatinous gold spread onto baguette slices and sprinkled with sea salt. (Not part of the 4/$48)\nROASTED PUMPKIN SOUP: I assume it's seasonal, and it is damn good. Get it while you can. This soup is surprisingly thick (like potato) yet smooth, with a light, rich flavor. The toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin oil added just the right bit of \"extra\" to keep it from being too simple.\nCHICKEN + ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: it's not my favorite version, but a passable one for the Strip location. Slightly spicy, surprisingly meaty, and served over soft white rice.\n\nSECOND COURSE\nEMERIL'S BBQ SHRIMP: Overcooked shrimp seemed like it had been sitting out, the NewOrleans barbecue glaze wasn't well-received by others at the table, and the rosemary biscuit had nice flavors but was hard and dry.\nSMOKEY MUSHROOM PASTA: A surprise hit! Fresh, perfectly al-dente pasta with tasso ham, smoked mushrooms, and parmesan cheese, with a zesty Cajun sauce. I could have done without the ham, and expected slightly more mushrooms given the name of the dish, but was pleasantly surprised by this dish.\n\nTHIRD COURSE (MAINS)\nEMERIL'S PORK CHOP: served with caramelized sweet potatoes, which paired perfectly and went perfectly with the colder fall season. This was one of the best pork chops I've had, tender and juicy with plenty of flavor and a great seasoning/glaze. The menu description also mentions a \"green chile mole\" that I either didn't receive or that simply wasn't distinct from the other flavors on the plate.\nCARAMELIZED SEA SCALLOPS: Got this over the short rib at the suggestion of our server, and ended up really enjoying it. Light flavors and portion, consisting of 3 large scallops served on a smear (there really should have been more!) of a great cauliflower puree, with a sea of brown butter sauce, accented with raisins, marcona almonds, and capers. This was surprisingly well-balanced, I liked that the capers didn't overpower the other, milder ingredients. I do wish the scallops had a better sear, though.\n\nFOURTH COURSE (DESSERTS)\nBANANAS FOSTER BREAD PUDDING: A decent bread pudding, topped with two lonely slices of banana, with a caramel glaze and more whipped cream and chocolate shavings. A less successful banana-based dessert.\nEMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE: Heavenly. A homemade crust topped with tons of fresh banana, a blanket of smoothly sweet banana cream, and decorated with chocolate curls, caramel sauce, and whipped cream. I would come back for this.\n\nOur server, Diana, was great at making suggestions and checking on us without being overbearing. Interior seating is dark and quiet with a date-night atmosphere.

Great flavor in the sausage, too.\n\nOpted for standard tots as our side, and we were encouraged to try a dipping sauce- opted for the fry sauce and was not disappointed.

The roasted garlic chips add flavor and texture.\nSteamed Foie Gras Egg Custard: great dish, minimal foie but still very enjoyable. There was also some roe in this that we hadn't expected.\nPoached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe: This dish wasn't for me at all. I like poached eggs, and urchin, and roe, but this didn't come together and the egg was closer to raw than poached.\nJuicy Deep Fried Chicken: an incredible introduction to the wonderful chicken dishes Raku's kitchen puts out, even the spinach garnish was delicious\n\nRice & Noodle\nGrilled Rice Ball in Broth with Salmon: Great pick. Light broth that tasted more like a tea due to the steeped seaweed in the dish. Rice retains the grilled texture despite being soaked in broth. Salmon surcharge was $3 but piece of fish was the size of a thumb nail, didn't contribute anything to the flavor.\n\nRobata\nChicken Thigh & Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin: the chicken robata dishes were my favorites, with a smoky grilled taste and juicy beyond belief\nKobe Beef Filet with Wasabi: the beef was good, but I'm not a fan of wasabi so that kind of ruined this for me\nKobe Beef Tendon: nope. not happening. too adventurous for me.\nPork Ear: Tasty with lots of texture. Server recommends their spicy table sauce, which was basically a punch of straight-up pepper. I'd recommend it without.\nDuck with Balsamic Soy Sauce: Ordered two of these knowing I'd love it, and I did. Lacked the gamey taste that turns a lot of people off to duck. Good choice.\nTomato with Bacon & Mushroom with Bacon: I'm not generally a bacon fan, but adding a veggie into the mix somehow does it for me. \n\nDessert\nFluffy Cheesecake: I'm not a dessert fan, and found this a bit too cheesy for me, but when you get to the raspberry filling? Oh man, all bets are off. \n\nAbove meal was under $200 with a carafe of Ashahi ($30) and tip, and enough for three to share happily.

Signage was advertising their new bourbon burger with caramelized onions, bleu cheese crumbles, bacon, and sweet bourbon sauce. \nOpted for the 1/2 pound version ($8) and asked for a side of fries. \nReceipt reflects that I was charged $13: apparently I was upgraded to a combo, despite not receiving a drink. Apparently a \"regular\" order of wedge fries consists of 12 pieces. For FOUR FUCKING FIFTY. ($4.49- close enough).\nI somehow did not realize this while I waited 20 minutes for my order.\n\nWas asked how I wanted my burger cooked, stated medium. Burger received was well done. Despite all the toppings listed in the ad, only the onions and bourbon sauce appeared to be present in flavor, and very scant amounts of each because it still came off as dry. Did not taste any cheese whatsoever. Fries were tasty, topped with the jalapeno cheese sauce from their condiment bar that I love so much-- just wish I didn't pay $4.49 for twelve fries.\n\nOh, and that part about service and a 20 minute wait for takeout?\nI placed my order with one guy just as a large group walked in, creating a line that literally went out the door. No one ever stepped on to the other register. Person ON register easily took five minutes to take each order- wonder how many of theirs, like mine, were taken incorrectly and overcharged.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lbDBVMkpSKaVgEU9tJOq2A"}

There is a lunch option to add on fries and a drink for an affordable price. The side of dolmades (grape leaves) tasted a little off, as if perhaps they were out of a jar. Filling texture was gummy and off-putting, and there was a strong, bitter after-taste that lingered uncomfortably that I haven't encountered with other versions.\n\nService was polite and the location is clean, but pricing is all over the place: $6 for a gyro is great, $2 to add on feta is a little absurd.

Bread/bakery section is larger here because of this, which is nice, though I don't buy those items.\n\nAlso of note: the parking closest to the store entrance is divided between Hybrid car-specific spaces and families with children spaces, as indicated by signage.

I know this isn't a porn museum, but all they had was just some standard biographical posters of well established porn stars and a \"cam girl display\" which was unfortunately not working when we were there. It, also, was painfully put of date.

For those who love carbs, there's also a soup/noodle section available. Pricing is a bit higher, but you have quite a bit to pick from.\n\nAPPS: The sashimi plate and sashimi poke were both pretty solid, with generous portions of fish. The \"lettuce wraps\" app isn't the typical version with ground chicken and vegetables, but features crab, avocado, cucumber, and tempura veggies in lettuce cups, which is at least kind of close to a riceless roll. \nGRILL/SKEWERS: We tried all of the items marked as \"one per person\" (garlic, bacon/scallop, bacon/asparagus, beef tongue, etc). We didn't really care for these items but liked having them available for something different.\nNIGIRI: Fresh with surprisingly thick cuts. Rice wasn't too heavy but also didn't seem to have much flavor. The salmon, halibut, and uni quality all surpassed my expectations (better than average for AYCE) but the amebi (BF's favorite) was super tiny and bland.\nROLLS: We tried the White Vegas and the XXX2 rolls, the former a bit spicier than the latter, neither one especially packed with rice as we've experienced elsewhere.

The girl tried swiping my card three or four times without giving me any explanation as a grumbling line began to form. Eventually I was told that the card kept taking a while to \"process\" but that it wasn't their machine because they'd done credit sales already that day- she kept pointing at a handful of three or four receipt strips by the cash register.

Arrived in time to hear Andy Grammer's upbeat, poppy set, got a kick out of Needtobreathe's southern-flavored rock, Lifehouse got the whole crowd singing along, Matt Nathanson was engaging and a little odd, but Third Eye Blind was what everyone waited for. They mixed old and new songs (and more of the latter than I would have preferred), but I skipped out early to avoid the clustercuss of the parking lot... and the clouds of pot smoke. I didn't come here for a second-hand high.\n\nFOOD: The bites were mostly under $5, and there were several featured vendors from chain places putting out their specialties (Raisin' Cane, PDQ, Shake Shack, Smoothie King, Lazy Dog, CJ's Custard) to local places and various food trucks (Clever Chefs, Going Green, El Ceviche, Aloha Kitchen & Bar, Violette's vegan). The low pricing allowed our group to sample several smaller items without spending a lot of scratch. Standouts include Lazy Dog's pumpkin cheesecake (the obvious award-winner in the dessert category), the gelati fruit bowl made from a halved baby watermelon at CJ's, and the tender and savory grilled chicken skewers at Aloha. The businesses with cooler treats (ice creams, slushes, Dole Whip) seemed to get the most  business.\n\nORGANIZATION: I found it odd that bags weren't checked at the gates, and I wish this event allowed you to leave and reenter (I don't know how anyone stayed the entire day, the heat was brutal). That said, crowd control was effective, I saw few smokers (it was technically only allowed in \"designated areas\" despite being an outdoor event), and there were ample portapotties.\n\nThis is definitely an event I'd come back to!

(Note: posted results go back several years, handy for comparing annual progress!)\n\nFollowing the race, participants were directed through an area of free snack/drink handouts heading to a stage featuring Matt & Kim performing a concert- unfortunately I was unable to stick around for that. Prior to race day, participants were emailed several free music downloads from participating musicians. Other participant perks include discounts on hotels, restaurants, spa services, and shops by showing your wristband throughout the weekend. Local support for the race up and down the Strip was tremendous.\n\nAdditional details I appreciated were the ability to customize your race bib and the cool finishes medals and tech shirts- different for each distance. Next year I plan to participate again, either in Vegas or somewhere else... hopefully running the 10K or half option!", "type": "review", "business_id": "M4aGbEXZjOnBFn9C6IbrYQ"}

The dozen set features very generic flavors: chocolate, red velvet, vanilla, yellow cake, etc. The cakes were overly moist (more like a pudding) and stuck to the wrappers, and they did not have much flavor, just sugary-sweet.

That being said, I still enjoyed everything I did get!\n\nBF and I worked hard moving into our new apartment and worked up an appetite- rushed to Heidi's for sustenance. We each got a sandwich and swapped halves to share: the Transplanted New Yorker on marble rye was his choice while the Salmon Melt on french was mine. Both came with pickles and cups of potato salad. \nI'm not a big spice fan but the NY was a good kind of spicy- it snuck up on you! Each bite started out mild and built up in eat for a spicy aftertaste. Bread was soft, meat was plentiful, and the avocado was a nice creamy touch.\nThe Salmon Melt was delish- I'm picky about warm salmon (I prefer it as sashimi) but the flavors were spot on. Add in the spicy cajun sauce and it had a good kick to it that added the much-needed \"extra something\" that a lot of salmon sandwiches lack.\n\nThe pickle was a great bit of cool flavor after the spicy sandwiches, and the potato salad was with red potatoes- which is so much better than regular mustard/mayo potato salad. Red potatoes make the salad so much better, no clue why. Maybe it's all in my head.\n\nIn any case, the sandwiches are effing huge- the half sandwich lunch combo would be a perfect meal, but with the half-and-half swap the BF and I did, neither of us completely finished. Which is a good thing. I could only manage about 3/4ths of each and it's the only meal I ate for the day. \nThe meal for both of us, with tax, came to a total of $20- awesome pricing for phenomenal portion sizes, great value.\n\nAlso worth a mention? The staff is badass. Super friendly and polite, cool guys. Had recommendations and suggestions, and even offered to make a half pastrami and half corned beef sandwich for the BF in the future. We'll definitely be back- the breakfast burrito, crab cake, and eggplant parm all need to be in my life. As do the soups!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z7q2V2XP3F5g0kLsmCFk9A"}

Lovely crispy breading.\nFRIED PICKLES: $5, overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.\nFOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8, shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy, but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.\n\nOur waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table, showed it to the female manager, Kelly, (who left the scene and never returned), and brought us our check along with a comment card, stating that \"the system\" did not \"allow\" her to give any \"discounts\" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.\n\nWe asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us), and the male owner, Robert, came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible, both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. \n\nHis response? A defensive, \"Well that's just like, your opinion.\" Literally. His exact response, no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's \"not afraid of bad Yelps\" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he \"doesn't give discounts.\"\nIn the end, unable to reach a civil agreement, we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he \"could comp the whole thing, whatever.\"  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. \n\nI like their concept, but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.\n\nEDIT: As of the time of this review, there are nearly 70 \"filtered\" reviews at the bottom of this page.

I'd pay double for an entr\u00e9e-sized portion and be happy with just that.

Not particularly crispy or flavorful, but plated in a fun way. Not a fan of the filling.\nJerk Shrimp Salad- the shrimp is blackened to greatness, but the salad itself fell flat. Dressing was bland and didn't tie the elements together. Ate less than half.\nDW Bloody Mary- $12 glass, split among our table of 3, still didn't finish it. The drink is 1/3 garnishes (love that jalapeno bacon!) and the beverage itself is nicely spicy, but it wasn't great and we agreed we wouldn't get it again.\n\nService was professional.

I belatedly noticed the chalkboard specials in the entry area after we'd already ordered, but it gave me several ideas for what to order next time.\n\nBEEF STROGANOFF RAGU ON PELMINI: BF said this was the best stroganoff he's ever had, and he grew up eating it in Russia and has had the dish more times than most Americans have had spaghetti and meatballs. Dumplings were great (though few, the order comes with 4 so it's shareable but only barely), loved that they weren't overcooked as they have been elsewhere we've ordered them. The mushroom ragout though was what really made the dish, and we made sure to scoop up what remained using the crusty homemade bread.\nKHACHAPURRI:  Georgian bread dish with cheese and egg; really rich and seems more like a breakfast or lunch dish than a dinner one to me, but something worth trying if you've never had it before. \nCHEBUREKI: a two-piece order for a good price,  good to add on and try. They're fried beef dumplings, similar in size and shape to a large potsticker, topped with green onion and dill. The dill especially really complements the filling, you'll want to pinch up extra from around the plate. \nTHRACIAN CLAY POT: a small-looking portion served in the clay pot it's made in, the dish is composed of tomato, egg, sausage, peppers, feta, and onion. Reminiscent of shakshuka, and best eaten with some of the homemade bread.\nBISCUIT CAKE: a take on tiramisu, super moist and flavorful with just the right amount of chocolate to make it sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Slightly disappointed that I did not taste the Lavazza espresso at all.\n\n\nWe've already decided to make this place a regular date night stop. So glad Ive finally found a place we'll go to regularly for eastern European food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F8ljll9IJhgUmOxUshlqiQ"}

BF has zero interest in this kind of thing, so I flew solo.\n\nHadn't been to the Luxor before, was easy to find parking and then the theater. Lines for box office and entrance went fast, was seated in the middle orchestra, about ten rows back.\n\nShow itself was very entertaining- several different musical styles and dance styles were showcased, everything perfectly synchronized. I have no idea how much they must practice to get everything so perfectly spot-on; and this coming from a former dancer. There are at least 14 people in the show, so it's a surprisingly large cast. I found that I enjoyed the routines that had the larger groups, just because there were always so many different things going on at once.\n\nThe underlying plot for this show is very vague, you don't really need to be following along in order to enjoy it. The show length clocks in just under 90 minutes and it's a good length before things start to get boring. Most parts of the show are fairly energizing, and there's a good amount of audience participation- which I personally could do without, actually, but apparently other people enjoy that sort of thing.\n\nI enjoyed the parts of the show that involved the Harlem Shake and Party Rock Anthem- though they are dated at this point.  I could do without the Bohemian Rhapsody part, but I guess the song is popular all these decades later for a reason... allegedly. Regardless, this group does a great job of coordinating their dance moves to the music and to one another, in a way that manages to create a distinct personality for each member of the extensive cast despite virtually no dialogue and the fact that they are identically clothed and masked- quite a feat.\n\nFavorite part is, of course, the end, when they take off their masks for a mere moment- gotta say, part of me is really bummed that they don't have a girl on the team. Not that I thought any of them were female during the show, but that would be a cool surprise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n6oNY8L8iEWkRksJkmwCqg"}

The nachos were tasty, but after getting the free chips and salsa/guac it was almost chip overload. The cheese was plentiful yet subtle, and the salsa had a light fruitiness to it- a lot of different flavors somehow came together really well. The cheesesteak is the stuff dreams are made of, for my BF- he inhaled it. Huge portion, great value for the price, but for me it lost the excitement after a few bites and the fries were just right (in terms of cooking- they were perfectly crisp) but bland (no salt or seasonings).\nThe won ton soup was our only non-fusion item and it was a good-sized portion with plenty of won tons and a light yet flavorful broth, with lots of onions. The description mentioned mushrooms but I only found one- not clear if they were inside the 'tons and one popped out, or if there were meant to be more.\n\nService leaves a lot to be desired. Only one waitress for the whole place, fairly slow and a bit too casual for my liking, but we did get our food and their business did pick up so I should probably not be quite so picky.\n\nOverall, the food was tasty- enough so that my BF ordered a burrito go to to take to a friend he wanted to introduce the food to- but after so many five star reviews and a great rating, I just had hyper-inflated expectations, I guess.\nWill be trying the burrito myself next visit- wasn't in the mood for one last night, but maybe that dish will push me into five-star territory.", "type": "review", "business_id": "H_SuH7uLiYahDMbNBB9kog"}

Minimal sprinkle of garlic and parm outside, mostly smaller wings, again they just didn't really do anything for me.\n\nBEEF ON WECK Pizza of the day was not my style but I really appreciated the creativity that went into taking a NY sandwich and creating a pizza version of it; beef on top, horseradish sauce, creamy mozzarella, and a salted/seasoned crust. Flavors are strong and bold, tasty, but not something I'd eat more than a slice of.\n\nFATBOY PIZZA is the bomb though: Cappicola, pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, crushed tomato, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and red sauce. It smells amazing and tastes even better, the tomato and basil really add a lot of flavor. I like that though it as several meats, they're distributed in such a way that it's an overwhelming grease bomb like other meaty pizzas. \n\n I think I need to leave this place on my list to visit again and try the Guinea pizza when I have a bigger appetite (or perhaps after hitting the gym). I've been mostly underwhelmed by non-pizza options here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mXk7cxR0OeZESz8S2q18Jw"}

Impressive costume changes, but the singer does not look like Madonna until the \"Like a Virgin\" part. I did like that she interacted quite a bit with the audience.\n\nMichael Buble- guy bears a passing resemblance to the singer he's impersonating, and has a good voice, too. Not on part with the real thing, but hey, this is Vegas. Loved this set, probably my favorite of the evening, especially \"I Just Haven't Met You Yet\" and \"Home\". Wouldn't mind seeing this guy again.\n\nMichael Jackson- despite many reviews here saying this performer was the best by far, I disagree. The resemblance is uncanny and his dance moves are amazing though, I will say. Maybe I'm just not that much of an MJ fan. It was obvious that he was doing very little singing, a lot of lip syncing, and mostly just providing the extra noises and grunts, etc to go along with the music, and little of the actual singing. The dancing though was very impressive. I'm glad \"Thriller\" was done, and \"Billy Jean\" was better than I would have expected.\n\nElvis- great hair on this guy, good voice and dance moves, too. Felt that this performer was better than the one from All Shook Up at the V Theater, though this performance obviously has a much higher budget. Did a sampling of all the great hits, including most memorably \"Blue Suede Shoes\" and \"Heartbreak Hotel\".\n\nAll in all, it was a decent show- the dancers really made the music come alive, even when the audio wasn't that great or the performer did not seem to be singing live.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hkeYoEfdlCks_rFeIWHOkQ"}

Our food was brought out, we were checked on throughout our visit, and given a goodbye as we walked out the door- all with a smile by the gentleman behind the counter.\n\nAs for the food: BF got a 6 piece fried with a side of mac, I opted for the 4 piece rotisserie with a side of veggies, and we added on a hot chick and a thai tea- the latter mostly because since when have I ever been able to get chicken strips and thai tea in the same place? Bizarre but lovely. The drink was out right away and just a smidge less sweet than I am used to. $2 cup is well-priced.\n\nThe chicken arrived hot and tasty: BF surprisingly preferred the grilled while I preferred the panko breading for the fried version. We tried several different sauces including the ranch (nothing interesting), wasabi (nice with just a little kick), honeymustard (light but not my thing), strip sauce (my favorite), and buffalo (my second favorite, dude's preferred dip). BF put it well: he'd come back for the grilled strips tossed in buffalo sauce, but the rest of the menu seemed too similar to Raisin' Cane's for his liking, and he's a huge fan of theirs.\n\nAs for the sides: the mac was super indulgent and better than the mac I've had at more formal or high-end places. Loved that the dish was still gooey and cheesy instead of dried out, which I run into a lot at places that call themselves \"southern\" or boast about being \"homestyle\". Dude, if I made this mac at home, I'd never leave... because I'd weigh 500 pounds. It's good, but definitely only get if you went to the gym that day, there's a lot of guilt involved with that much pasta and cheese.\nThe grilled veggies were a surprise hit with BF, he'd tack those on to his future grilled-with-buffalo purchase.\n\nLastly, the hot chick was oddly again one of my favorite things: a simple fried strip doused in buffalo sauce (sensing a theme?) and placed in a small bun with lettuce and tomato, it's simple and it's delicious. There's  meal option for two of those with a side, and I'd likely consider it in the future.\n\nFinal note about their loyalty program: tracks your purchase spendings by the dollar, when you reach a $60 total you get a free meal. I didn't ask for more details but I do like that it tracks with your phone number rather than yet another pesky key tag or card to keep track of.", "type": "review", "business_id": "N8cJk5s9yW3fLeJyHQeRAA"}

No contact was made to alert me of this prior to arriving at the airport. Every other airline I've flown has texted and/or called me in a timely manner. Had to make two trips in one hour to our lovely airport to retrieve my guy. Staff had absolutely no ability to reschedule anything or come up with any possible solutions. This airline only seems to have evening/red-eye flights, so next available flight was 24 hours away, which didn't work for the conference we were travelling for in the first place.\n\nSince rescheduling with the same airline was not an option, had to shell out last-minute ticket prices for American Airlines- twice the price. Spirit has very strict policies/rules about when/how to request refunds, and I'm happy someone informed me that they are only able to issue one refund per trip per person. In other words, if your first flight has an issue, don't do anything about it until you have thoroughly completed your travel with Spirit. Because if you have additional issues getting home, they won't be able to do anything. Which makes no sense at all.\n\nReturn flight was also delayed, but luckily not cancelled. Which isn't to say it's wasn't without irritation. What was supposed to be a 11PM arrival barely made it around 1:30AM. Luckily I didn't have work in the morning.\n\nOverall flight experience is miserable. Tiny-ass seats, very strict luggage requirements, steep fees for every little thing, not even water is free of charge in the air.

Sandwich was adequately moist, beef was tender and high quality with great flavor, hot pepper sauce also had a kick of garlic to it. \n\nFoot long Vienna Chili Cheese Dog: a bit confused as to why this was two regular dogs on one 12\" bun, but the chili and cheese were both good. Definitely add onions to this. Poppy seed bun is a great little upgrade.\n\nChicago Style Dog: Not as good as the one I had at Al's, can't put my finger on why. Bun didn't hold up too well, flavors seemed a little muted compared to other versions I've had.\n\nPizza Puff: Basically a ballpark version of a pizza hot pocket, complete with odd processed flavor but it totally brings back the memories for me. Probably don't ever need to get this but it's a cheap $3.50 add-on to your meal, and big enough to split.\n\nSide of fries was huge and salty, one is enough for two to share and then some.\nWill come back to try the wings and gyro eventually, so for I've been sticking to their staples. Service is very friendly, takeout orders are well-packed in wax paper and about an entire roll of foil to travel well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0Wu4-E2NKM-H8Yt7zZ-cxw"}

With 6 locations in town (and one more on the way) it isn't hard to find one that works for your schedule- though they do vary greatly. And they're open 24/7, which helps those in our city with unusual schedules!\n\nAs others have said, this one rocks a dated vibe that used to be reminiscent of the 80s- there is still some of that here.

I will say that the juice bar, crazy awesome gym schedule, sauna, and women's-only area are some of the things that helped balance out to a positive experience.\n\nGym schedule, as I said, is crazy awesome: morning, daytime, afternoon, and evening classes available. They only have two rooms for classes (pilates/yoga and cycle in one, cardio group classes in the other)- but they pack their schedule.

So the dish is basically cheese fries with cheese sticks, with some underwhelming Guiness gravy. Fries were unseasoned, gravy was lackluster, dish went unfinished split among three people.\nSOUP OF THE DAY: $5 for their daily bowl, which was chicken curry. It was mostly rice and had no spice, as though this were Campbell's interpretation of a curry. Not thrilled.\nSCOTCH EGG: Sausage was eerily reminiscent of a breakfast sausage, but the mustard aioli on the plate kicked things up a level. This is sided with a heap of spring greens they call a salad, but nothing else. Odd.\nSTICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Spiced and sauced bundt cake, with a bit of whipped cream. This version does not come close to comparing to any others in town. Go elsewhere for your fix. Another unfinished dish for us.\n\nDismal food and shitty service make for a large empty bar in the middle of the weekend, despite large screens showing multiple sports games.

One particular table really made a negative impact on my experience by constantly banging on their instruments and screaming throughout the show. The screens repeatedly said for people to keep their instruments silent before the show. After the show started, a video clip informed the audience that people who were not keeping to the responsible-use stipulations with their instruments would be escorted out. This was never enforced.

Too bad for them, because I planned ahead to hit them today and while waiting in their parking lot from 11:15-11:30, no less than six people walked up and decided against waiting for them to open.

Order took a reasonable 15 minutes, server brought me cold water while I waited, which was appreciated. When my order was brought out, the box was opened to show me the food and I was given extra lemons and tartar sauce without even asking, which was great.\n\nCrab cake sandwich itself was tasty- the cake is a good size and surprisingly delicate with a light flavor. Good amount of crab and not too much breading was used, but felt the seasoning was almost a bit too light. Tartar sauce is made in house and it's evident in the taste: light, fresh, spot-on flavor! Only issue I took with my order was that the sandwich was stuffed with three lettuce leaves and two thick slices of tomato, almost as if to make the sandwich look bigger- but the extra toppings made the sandwich messy so half had to be removed.

We ordered several suggested dishes only to be underwhelmed and unimpressed at the beginning of our meal, but as we branched out and tried some of the more exotic choices, the quality and experience improved sharply. Learn from our mistakes!\n\nPLAY IT SAFE\nPAN DE CRISTAL CON TOMATE FRESCO: toasted bread with fresh tomato. Tasty but very basic, kick it up to something that's actually worth getting by adding Manchego cheese or anchovies.\nJAMON IBERICO FERMIN: if you're going to come here, you may as well try the famous ham. It's not all that much different from prosciutto, in my opinion. We were underwhelmed.\nCOLIFLOR CON OLIVAS Y FRUTOS SECOS: the contrasting flavors of the dates and olives was enjoyable, but the roasted cauliflower that forms the base of the dish was treated as an afterthought. \nCROQUETAS DE POLLO: described as chicken fritters and served inside of a shoe, this will add some excitement to an otherwise tame table of dishes. One in our party described this dish as \"like a mini hot pocket of chicken pot pie\". It was tasty, but not the standout menu item other reviews (or even our server) made it out to be.\nARROZ CON COSTILLAS DE CERDO IBERICO DE BELLOTA Y ALCACHOFA: The pig-rib paella is tasty but not particularly adventurous. This is the only paella I've ever had where the rice was extremely crispy- I am not sure if it was overcooked, if we just got the bottom of the batch, or if it was intentional, but I did not particularly like it. \n\nGO FOR THE GOLD\nJOSE ANDRES GIN & TONIC: $20 for a G&T is ridiculous, but luckily it is also ridiculously good.\nACEITUNAS RELLENAS Y ACEITUNAS \"FERRAN ADRIA\": Olives two ways! One is stuffed with pimiento and anchovies, the other is a liquid olive using molecular gastronomy cooking techniques. It's essentially a flavored bubble and fairly fun to experience.\nBUNELOS DE BACALAO: Deep-fried salt codfish with honey aioli. The sauce is unlike anything else I've had, and the crispy fried fish is well-executed without being greasy.\nCAZON FRITO: AKA SHARK NUGGETS! I love this dish. Fried thresher shark with a garlic aioli. I've never had shark but now I'm definitely interested in trying other versions. This was battered without being crispy, fried without being greasy, and simple without disappointing. Would get again!\nPULPO ASADA CON CREMA CEBOLLA: Perfectly-charred grilled octopus, served with green cherry tomatoes, onion puree, and garlic oil. This was fantastic, the entire table considered it a top dish. Must order!\nCOSTILLAS DE CORDERO MORUNO: Succulent grilled rack of lamb with parsley oil. Simple but amazing. One of my favorite versions of lamb in Vegas.\nPASTEL DE CAFE: \"Chocolate, coffee, and hazelnut tart with coffee rum ice cream.\" The menu description doesn't do it justice at all. The base is like a crunchy cookie, topped with pure coffee-chocolate deliciousness, then a smooth ice cream with a delicious sauce on the plate. An indulgent, coffee-lovers dessert.\n\nWe ordered the dishes above in nearly this exact order. Total with tax and tip was just over $250, for a filling dinner for a group of three. As later dishes kept impressing us, I began to get a better feel for the restaurant's strengths, and would come back to try new items.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cN6qpVw6RaSrSI-JGGF4Tw"}

Unfortunately, the dessert course took it down rather than up. It's a good value for lunch, and the majority of four- and five-star reviews seem to be based on lunch experiences that emphasize the value: at $25.15 per person for a three-course pre-fixe, it's not bad. But it's not great, either. Diner who opted for the $16 wine pairing thought neither selection was particularly interesting, YMMV.\n\nAPPETIZERS: Table bread had a light char on it that infused a slightly burned taste, fellow diners were divided over whether this added to or detracted from their enjoyment. Would appreciate herbs added to the decent-quality dipping oil. The mezze platter features various dips and crudit\u00e9s, the hummus was one of the best local versions I've had with a great texture. The tomato salad was simple and tasty but went unfinished with our group. The crab cake ($10 supp) was extremely good, but also unexpectedly tiny. The much-hyped grilled octopus ($10 supp), which I'd most been looking forward to, was well-flavored but disappointingly overdone and tough. I was bummed to see the scallop and calamari options visible on their website were not on the available menu.\nMAINS: The sea bass lacked seasoning but was perfectly cooked, broccoli side was unremarkable. The shrimp saganaki lacked flavor and the shrimp themselves were overcooked and cold instead of hot, fresh, and juicy. Lobster Pasta ($15 supp) has beautiful presentation but received mixed feelings at our table: I enjoyed the light tomato sauce while others found it bland and complained about the lack of lobster content and flavor in the dish. The chicken skewer was nicely seasoned and juicy but fairly boring, however the fries were spectacularly well done and paired well with the tzatziki sauce.\nDESSERT: We didn't finish even half of any single dish from this course. The Greek yogurt was the only decent item, and had great texture, but could have benefitted from additional fruit garnish rather than a single berry and a drizzle of compote. Would have preferred this with honey and walnuts, as it was previously served. The fresh fruit plate looked like the dismal remains of a business meeting buffet. The walnut cake and ice cream was a dry, flavorless mess topped with an icy, flavorless glob. \n\nI like the option to do the pre-fixe but if nearly a third of the available options incur a fee that then doubles the price, why bother? The dishes are fresh and appealing, but the trend of overcooking-and-underseasoning dishes is a basic execution error I don't expect to encounter on the Strip. Meal for four with coffees and  tip averaged to $50/pp and was underwhelming to all, which negated the \"great food for a great value\" claims that brought us in for our visit in the first place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_6gbnNRPIc-iM_0cBLPX1A"}

The combination of tomatoes and cheese and crust was spectacular- made me very curious to try the margherita.\nUnfortunately the pork was on the dry side, but it was still surprisingly flavorful and did not detract from the other elements of the dish- kind of an impressive feat.

So, so good.\nABURI SABA: Can't go wrong with mackerel, didn't care for the acidic dipping sauce it was paired with.\nSALMON DON: bowl of sushi rice topped with salmon sashimi. Salmon was good, portion of rice was a bit much.\nTOMATO BACON: if you love BLTs, you'll love this. Not particularly unique but love the taste, I get this often.\nTEMPURA CHEESE: Now THIS surprised me. Tempura mozzarella, havarti, and brie. The portion of fig jam could have been more generous, it was barely a single bite. Dish wa still good.\nSALMON SASHIMI: Quality of fish in the don was so good we just asked for an additional order of sashimi. For $11, it's a steal. So fresh and delicious, just dip slightly in soy sauce and enjoy.\n\nDon't forget to use your Yelp check-in offer for a free appetizer.

A member of the Mon restaurant group (which also includes Monta and Sushi-Mon), this spot is generally regarded as their best effort and highest quality. \n\nUnfortunately, by the time I finally made a trip here, I was underwhelmed. Maybe my familiarity with their Sushi-Mon location on Sahara is to blame- their menus are virtually identical, with Goyemon offering additional items at dinner and some more unique specials. The quality of fish was good, but having a friendly relationship with a Sushi Mon chef garnered me the same product at their sister store. I really didn't see the upside to coming here instead.\n\nService during my recent visit was frustrating- server did not come around very often, food was came out slow and sporadic, and rice was falling apart on all rolls and nigiri. Not what I expect given the reputation that precedes this joint. They were busy, but not overwhelmed. \n\nI will say that the menu of rolls is extensive and their pricing is very fair ($22/lunch, $27/dinner). It's also nice that their last dinner seating is at 2AM. Better to visit for dinner than lunch, for increased menu options. But frankly I just found it good, not great.\n\nTLDR\nStandby items: superwhite tuna, garlic tuna, mackerel, and halibut nigiri; Lemon, Moon, Hurricane and Ecstasy rolls.

But I ultimately opted for the soup and salad combo, with the wedge and the lobster bisque- the salad arrived already doused in a sea of dressing, which surely took it far beyond the listed calorie counts. The bisque was an odd dish- the first bite wasn't that great to me, and I considered asking to switch it out for the tomato, but as I ate more of the dish it grew on me.

The dishes were huge, and they easily could have shared a single order instead of getting separate dishes, but one dish had overcooked pasta that was borderline mushy while the other was a good al dente. Both ladies were underwhelmed by their selection and had buyer's remorse, of a sort- commenting that they wished they'd gone with their original choices, but felt like the dish would be better here given the conversation with our server.

The shredded beef was a little on the dry side, but I perked it up with a bunch of the creamy cilantro sauce- that stuff is the bomb dot com. The reina pepiada arepa was tasty too, but the flavor simply got boring after a few bites. \nLuckily, the yucca was there to save the day: crispy and chewy and garlicky, it's everything yucca is supposed to be! The $3 price tag was a bit steep for the 12 bits that I got, most of which were half-pieces. Would I get them again though? Resounding yes.\n\nService was okay: minimal but friendly, brought out my take out to me at a table and took my order efficiently. Decor in the restaurant is fairly typical for a taqueria, but with the added touch of local artwork on the right hand wall as you walk in, all available for purchase. Though the pieces were good and added to the ambiance of the restaurant itself, I'm again taken by the sticker shock- the two paintings closest to me were $110 and $380.

Initially thought the $6.50 price tag was steep, but it's a meal.\nThe lunch special was also $6.50, and a hefty portion, too. Compartments of the styrofoam takeout box were overflowing- fried rice was moist but a little boring, chow mein was chewy and a little plain, both both balanced out the crazy combination kung pao. I say crazy here in a good way though- it was a giant portion with every meat mixed in, and quite a bit of chopped veggies, too.

Being from Texas, we have plenty of breweries and frequent festivals where smaller companies get to inform attendees about their product and brand, and give out samples in the hopes that their creations will appeal to others and garner a wider customer base. \nSomehow, I thought this event would be similar.\n\nThe venue itself I was not a fan of, but I'll save that for another day.\nI was mostly bummed that so many generic beers were there, and the event itself was mostly a game of \"collect and down the cups as fast as you can\" with no regard to quality and little effort made on the part of the brand reps to engage with attendees- the usual spiel about the hiTstory of the company, their special lines or ingredients, their stance on hops and IPAs, etc.\n\nThat being said, the music was decent. Woudln't expect less from an event held at the Hard Rock, though I can't honestly say I'd heard of any of the performers or rushed out to download any of the artists I heard.\n\nIn future incarnations, I would love to see this festival get more smaller and specialty breweries involved, such as Alien out of Albuquerque (their nut brown ale is out of this world! pun intended) or Ranger Creek ... \nOr maybe somehow convince the attending breweries to have samples of their \"real\" beers instead of just their basics. Maybe they just know the audience here though- it was kind of fratty rather than a crowd focused on craft brews.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iyZqtTbx0KH_ki0_srLJ9A"}

Store itself isn't much: the other Euro markets have better selection and organization, and the only thing making this \"Mediterranean\" is their selection of baklava, olives, and olive oil. But all of their products can be found elsewhere in town, and their produce is less than fresh.\nBut the halal butcher is fairly unique: $27 for a giant lamb shank to be turned into a stew? Totally doable here.\n\nDine-in counter has a few basic tables and chairs but most orders seem to be for takeout. As advertised on a banner on building exterior, they have a chicken shwarma sandwich for $4.99. What the banner doesn't tell you is that it's a giant wrap with an amazing garlic sauce. That garlic sauce makes it, and it's what I miss from my favorite Med place in Texas. I'll come back for that, repeatedly!\n\nAnother score on the menu is the beef filet mignon kabobs: priced at a $12 plate for a good portion of tender, flavorful beef on a bed of yellow rice, with sides of marinated veggies and creamy hummus. Hummus was good, and is on the sides menu for about $5/portion along with babaghanoush and tabouli.\n\nCome for the chicken shwarma wrap and the filet, but not much else.

It's a giant portion of salty, crispy fries, topped with a healthy (NOT!) portion of lengua meat, sour cream, guac, and cheese.

I've experienced better,\" fully captures how I felt about CAC. I found them here on Yelp, visited their website, and sent an email requesting membership info. I'm new to town and used to a certain quality of gym and have some requirements: Precor ellipticals, zumba and body pump classes that actually fit my schedule, and a convenient location. I don't even mind a hefty price tag because fitness is a priority for me.\n\nBut I was distinctly underwhelmed by this gym.\nSure, you walk in and it seems ultra swanky and exclusive- even the guy at the front desk is wearing a jacket, for crying out loud.\n\nBut as I took myself on a tour of the facilities, I couldn't help but notice a few things that turned me off: the women's locker room has a ton of lockers, several bathroom stalls, and a bunch of showers.. but a tiny area to change in, with only one bench. It appears there's a push for members to pay the extra $50 for access to the private locker room. Okay, duly noted.\n\nThe downstairs cardio area has the machines I like, but I was a little bummed that the models present did not have the individual screens. Rather, there were two screens for the entire cardio area, and set at a bit of a distance away. No big, I can bring in my iPad and watch Netflix while I churn out my miles right? Nope, no wifi. For $50/month, you'd think that would be a given.\n\nUpstairs wasn't much better- tons of equipment, and only a few people present, most of whom were working one on one with trainers or just sitting around. In fact, that's what bugged me most: maybe I was just there during an off-peak time, but everyone present seemed more focused on being in such a swanky environment. I don't think I saw anyone there genuinely working up a sweat.\n\nUltimately I didn't feel very comfortable here but still wanted to give the place a try. Met up again with Juan, my tour guide who stayed at the front desk, and received what passed for the \"sales pitch\"- a laminated card of their pricing, and a vague, \"So, wanna sign up?\"\n\nI had mixed feelings about that- I really didn't feel sold to or pressured, which was a plus. But I also didn't feel like any attempt at all was made to MAKE me want to join this gym. I genuinely wanted to give them a try, but the fact that I wasn't even able to get a pass for a day or two to try it out and see if I liked it was discouraging.\n\nTo end on a positive note though, for the month of January their promotion is that the initiation fee is half off: to join it's usually $120 + your monthly fee based on your membership ($50 on up to like $150 to get access to kickboxing/CrossFit); but in January it's just $60.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nvpCJx9OR2tp3GBXTFzVhA"}

Presentation is better in pics from dine-in visits, rice needed more sauce and I would have asked for more onions if I'd dined in.\n\nBut the highlight of my visit was the *TRINITY SLIDERS* (trio sliders of braised pork, spicy caramelized onions and lime marinated tomatoes)-- they are AMAZING. If you go, they are a mandatory order. Trust me, you'll love them. The pork is succulent, the onions add that perfect touch of flavor and melted-onion texture, and the tomatoes are a unique spark of acidity. They are damn delicious.

We really could have done without the chili cheese fries, and they were underwhelming- the fries were unsalted and the chili was very basic, we should have stopped at the dogs or tried the Euro Special instead.\n\nWas impressed enough with the dogs we had to come back- BF is already making a list of what he wants to try on his next visit. But we're more likely to split 3 dogs than do 2 plus a side of fries next time. One dog is easily a meal for a girl or guys who don't have huge appetites, so don't go overboard ordering. Decent prices, too: think everything is about six dollars each, from the dogs and burgers to pimped-out fries.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ADTZPVMIYJN0jAvvHxcBMw"}

The caprese and salmon components didn't particularly go together, nor did the flavors complement one another, but somehow it worked as a salad.\nThe wrap was damn good, too: mahi mahi with spinach, sprouts, organic brown rice, feta, and avocado, served with a tangy orange sauce for dipping.

The hummus plate and crispy beef soft (oxymoron?) tacos sounded tasty but we chose the tri tip sliders and the mushroom flatbread.

If you're going to serve tri tip, let it shine instead of covering it with sauce as if it's pulled pork. MUSHROOM FLATBREAD was just okay, not some thing I'd pay full price for ($11)- it's hard to go wrong with mushrooms and cheese but the bread itself was really dry and floury. It was nicely crisp, but only the middle had any toppings.\n\nService was not really present- in addition to having to ask for the HH menu to begin with, the hostess never brought it and once we asked for it our server was rarely seen.

Curry was very creamy, but ordering a 3/5 was considerably more mild than expected. I do appreciate that brown rice is available without a surcharge. Portion was ample for lunch. \nPAPAYA SALAD: $10 for a salad without any protein or flavor. Lots of shredded papaya, but the clearly-frozen-from-a-bag green beans were a complete turn off. The dressing lacked the acidity and pop to make it add anything other than moisture to the salad itself. \n\nI did not experience the service issues that others mention, but didn't see our server much to begin with. I was a little put off by their lack of a public bathroom?*- guess it's lucky I didn't get my curry as hot as I'd wanted, which would have made my guzzle down more water. \n\nProps for having bottles of San Miguel available, and the various outdoor seating areas with misters are a nice touch. But I've had better Thai from takeout spots that are half the price.\n\n*EDIT: I've been corrected that there is indeed a bathroom here, apparently it's outside?

Lemon pepper garlic is your best choice, spice it up if you want. We got someone else's order by accident, which was Ragin' Cajun cranked up to hot, and it was surprisingly good. I don't really get why the legs are cooked with seasoning in the bag, as the sauce doesn't penetrate to the meat.

Maybe they're not consistent?\nFRIED CATFISH BASKET: Basket comes with cajun fries, which are thin, hot, and perfectly crisp. The fish comes in 4-5 huge pieces of hot, juicy, flaky fish, served with one single cup of a lightly-flavored tartar sauce. I'd get this again. It's a huge portion for only $10, too.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the oddly corporate-chain feel of the space but I can't put my finger on what gives me the weird vibe. The food is fresh and it's a fun dining environment, but I have no idea why this place is so popular with H&J in town as a worthy competitor.\n\nTIP: This might be a good spot to watch a game, as there are ~50 TV screens hanging everywhere.

Had a few customer service issues redeeming my deal, mostly pertaining to the receipt- face value of my deal was for $18, yet I only received credit for $15.36 and somehow owed about $2. Employees were unable or unwilling to explain why the transaction happened this way.\n\nIn any case, the food was fairly tasty.\nBeef tagine seems to be a frequent special, and it smells amazing. Taste isn't quite as delicious as the smell though, but I did appreciate that the dish was served on a bed of rice and with a drink (though they didn't give me mine). Beef itself is on the dry side, but it's a saucy dish so it did not ruin the meal.\nThe chicken shwarma salad is decent: moist chicken and fresh veggies, but a bit too much rice for my liking turned it into more of a bowl. Tahini dressing was on the bland side and slightly chalky. They charge 50 cents to add a tablespoon of feta to your dish- and they literally measure out it with a spoon, which is bizarre and stingy to me.\n\nI wouldn't hurry to rush back, largely because of their lack of transparency with billing, but there are so many other places that do Mediterranean in Vegas that I'd rather try another. I can say though, if you are craving beef tagine specifically, this place will probably hit the spot- flavors are correct, but hope it was just an off day for the meat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKO1eefgrWjTp-NnsS7FTw"}

BF and I are on a health food kick but still like dining out- the reviews here made me order the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Mediterranean chicken wrap, add chicken. We split the orders, along with a side of Brussels sprouts, and were both full and happy, for just under $30. Not bad!\n\nFirst impression is that this place is small but organized, and has a light and natural decor scheme. I like the grass theme that managed to be everywhere from the walls to the window stickers and the menu. The TV-screen menu with images of each dish was a nice touch.\n\nI'm not usually an ahi tuna taco fan, but when you see so many reviews in a row raving about them, you try them. And, here at Daily Kitchen, I think I found a new favorite dining-out dish! The three tacos are a hefty portion and the tacos themselves are super tasty, with a spicy sauce that sneaks up on you, a light and crunchy slaw for texture and extra veggies, and a good amount of fresh ahi. I think I could eat these three times a week and not get bored. I may even try to test that theory- they're that good. Pricing is okay- for $13, I had expected a side.\n\nThe Mediterranean wrap on lavash with chicken is gigantic. I didn't finish my half and took it home for later. The lavash wrap is light, and the wrap is packed with tons of grilled chicken ($3 add on cost, great serving size), creamy hummus, and veggies. I only found one kalamata olive in my half, which is a good thing because their flavor is so strong that it totally overpowers the bite that it's in.  Serving size was very good on this, and the brussels sprout side was also a giant and delicious portion- I'm not sure what was on them, if they were just cooked in olive oil or if there was liquid crack in the saute, but they were phenomenal. Way better value than a generic side of sweet potato fries- though to be fair, I haven't tried them here.\n\nMark this down as a new favorite place for us! Might try the beet salad next time, but still sticking to the ahi tacos.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EcUM3ONkY1RUCB1R1_4FrA"}

I raved about this place not two months ago and had an amazing first visit. I came back this evening  specifically because it was so awesome. I ordered nearly the exactly the same thing...but it feels like I was at an entirely different restaurant- and not in a good way.\n\nOrdered the ahi tuna tacos for myself, again, and my guy opted for the spicy thai chicken wrap this time, with the same side of Brussels sprouts. \nTacos were not as big as last time, and other than the fish, they only contained carrots (no cilantro?), one lonely avocado slice, and a squirt of sauce. What was fresh and popping with flavor last time was underwhelming and bland this time, and the bottoms of the tacos were drenched to the point that they were nearly soggy with lime juice (or maybe it was water from the carrots?) and dripping everywhere.\nThe wrap had a lot of very spicy sauce- possibly meant to drown out the small amount of dry chicken. Wrap, like the tacos, had noticeably less filling this time, and the flavor was off balance: proportions wrong, overwhelming sauce, not much else to speak of.\nEven the sprouts, so delicious and flavorful last time, were the last item out and somehow undercooked- left half the bowl behind, flavorless and rock-hard.\n\nI have no idea what happened.\nThe food wasn't anywhere near as good as our first visit.

A final thing to highlight is their ready-made foods section, with lots of grab-and-go lunch options: wraps and sandwiches in large portions for under $3, various salads, pizzas, and wings available too. \n\nMuch like Fresh and Easy (RIP!)

Food was satisfactory, some items were much better than others; service wasn't quite on par with restaurant price point or reputation.\n\nBREAD PLATE: Best start to a meal, ever. Three different varieties (lemon herb focaccia, a cinnamon roll-looking thing with prosciutto, and a crispy baguette-slice that tasted like straight-up cheese). All served with the best butter I've ever had, with black sea salt. Breads in order of deliciousness.\n\nFRENCH ONION SOUP: Skippable. Bouchon's is way better. This one has virtually no cheese but is quite rich, consistency more similar to a gravy than a soup. Very scant amount of onions in the bottom, mostly broth in our two orders.\n\nAMERICAN KOBE BEEF SLIDERS: Hyped for a reason, they're delicious. Cheese taste could be more pronounced but quality of meat was the star of this dish. Motivating me to hit up BurGR sooner than I'd planned.\n\nBONE IN RIB EYE: Large portion, great flavor, ordered medium due to table preferences but would have been much better medium-rare. Great crust, plated with a sauce that added just a bit of extra something to it.\n\nBEEF WELLINGTON: Had to try this at least once, underwhelmed. The pate didn't really complement the beef, quality of meat seemed lower in this dish than in others but glad I tried it. Least favorite dish of the night, actually.\n\nBEEF SHORTRIBS: Star of the night! Meaty, falling apart, packed a punch of flavor, plated with an amazing gravy sauce with mushrooms and spinach. Would definitely get this again, highly recommend.\n\nLOADED BAKED POTATO SIDE: Roughly the size of a football, too salty for me to really enjoy but the gouda was delicious and BF's dad really enjoyed it.\n\nMAC AND CHEESE: Shut the front door. This is my new favorite mac dish. I ate almost the entire dish, and I'll take the over on it being worth 5K calories. Worth it, see you at the gym! Didn't expect the peas in this dish but surprisingly didn't mind them.\n\nSTICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Another obligatory purchase, but this one was totally wroth it. I'm not a dessert person but this was downright decadent, delicious cake with toffee sauce and a fabulously light but flavorful ice cream. Bonus points for plating it with a candle for my special day.\n\nDRINKS: Interactive drink menu is on an iPad, underwhelmed by the cocktails but the Justin Paso Robles wine will go with absolutely any of the beef dishes here. If you're in more of a beer mood, the Oskar Blues Old Chub \"Knightro\" is flipping amazing.\n\nSERVICE: As I said, the service wasn't quite on par with the price point or reputation of the restaurant. Two drink orders were missed, and despite having an assistant helping out our server it seemed as if we were largely ignored for portions of the evening. Water levels, wait times, and such were not paid as much attention as expected.\n\nSEATING & DECOR: Highly recommend getting a booth seat next to the kitchen to be able to see the prep station, added extra level of entertainment. Cool bar set in a tube, red lighting fixture based on the arm motions to create GR's famous dessert, small touches that made this place stand apart. Side note, there are easily eight hostesses in black mesh club wear? Awkward costumes, entirely too many bodies in the front of the restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mDdqifuTrfXAOfxiLMGu5Q"}

I'm actually kind of bummed that no one in their marketing department has run with that, considering they have no qualms about calling their main bar \"The Long D\"... which is fairly self-explanatory.\n\nThat being said, this place is pure chaos. You have to wind your way through 6 floors of reserved valet parking to find a spot, and corners are blind without any mirrors, and lanes are narrow. Additionally, if the garage is completely full there is no signage nor any employees posted to prevent new cars from entering- I experienced this unique brand of frustration during a visit over the summer.\nThis garage should have been added onto during the reno, as each floor is small and probably maxes out at 50 spaces. For the parking situation alone, I would not stay here.\n\nOnce you finally make it in the casino (an assumption, perhaps), I will say that it isn't as smoky as I expected from all of the other reviews here- then again, all of the doors are open to the Fremont Experience and there was a good breeze going.\n\nAs I navigated my way to the showroom, employees were few and far between, and those I could find were fairly clueless and most were just standing around- one in particular was wandering the floor with a broom and dustpan in tow and was literally walking slower than a woman with a walker, and kept getting bumped into by patrons who were simply trying to get around the two of them and on their merry way.\n\nOn the bright side, the showroom is upstairs and away from most of the hustle and bustle- but they're not particularly organized, either. I was able to pick up my tickets immediately and was spared the line, but I was late (due to the garage situation) and arrived just as it was supposed to start- and yet, the line was wound around the entire floor to accommodate the huge line because no one had yet been allowed into the showroom. After the alleged start time.\n\nOn the bright side, as I left, I was not charged for parking despite a giant sign in self-park saying it was $2/hour. I also consider it a positive that the garage exit is run entirely by a single computerized gate rather than a person in a booth. I prefer technology to the quality of casino employee found in such positions.

Not that Chinatown has many bad spots.

It's amazing, and I'd come back just for this dish- side of brown rice wasn't even necessary. Delicious way to have eggplant, and despite being a sticky and almost sweet sauce it did not feel like a heavy meal. \n\nThe won ton soup was a bit underwhelming. I did appreciate how the noodles were packed separately for my takeout order so as not to fall apart in the broth, and I liked the won tons themselves. But the broth was lacking. I liked the green taste to it, and it oddly reminded me of a green smoothie, except in broth form. As in, you could taste the veggie vibrancy. But it was still somehow flat. Noodles were also much thinner than I prefer, and seemed to simply be thin spaghetti rather than ramen.\n\nThe dessert was underwhelming as well. The green tea ice cream melted very quickly and was also lacking in flavor- I've experienced varieties with more of a chalky texture but stronger machta taste, but this version was on the thin side rather than creamy. Also struck me as odd that the sticy rice was orange.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QY8CBhPwv6dE4onjhj6MDg"}

Not too many reviews mention it, but this place has a stellar selection of salads, all on display at the counter for you to select as sides. They're nearly $3/scoop, but they're big scoops and the ingredients are quality- bf and I sampled the beet salad (with citrus, pickled onion, and hazelnuts), the tandoori chicken salad (with mango, papaya, coconut, cucumber, red onion, and cilantro), and the curry cauliflower salad (with kale, golden raisins, almonds, and pickled onion). Each was bursting with flavor, and getting a couple sides could easily be a light meal.\n\nFor our entrees, we opted for the hangar steak chimmichurri on a bed of truffled Israeli couscous wild mushrooms risotto style and the free range marguerite chicken with quinoa, asparagus and roasted cherry tomatoes. I initially felt the $14/plate was a little steep considering average pricing for their salads, sandwiches, and other dishes- but as soon as our plates came out, it was clear that the price was worth it. The ingredients, again, were high quality, and even the plating was beautiful and made the food look good- everything looked exactly as in the photos on the menu. The taste was off the charts! The meats were clearly cooked fresh and in good portions, the sauces for each dish were complex and delicious, and the sides/vegetables complemented the protein perfectly. \n\nThe guys in the kitchen clearly know what they're doing, and it shows in the care and quality that come out on each plate. I'm happy to have another healthy dining option in the area- next time, I plan to try the ahi tuna sliders or the pan-seared salmon!\n\nSide note: Take out menu states that they have happy hour 3pm-5pm daily on selected menu items.

Grits were okay, bacon was crispy and added both flavor and texture, eggs were cooked perfectly, but shrimp were small and overcooked- should have been blackened, not precooked and tossed on like an afterthought. They lacked flavor and the pico was the most stand-out element of the dish, and there wasn't much of it.\n\nI'm not generally a fan of community tables, though they're not much different than sitting at the bar- but I did make friends with the super-sweet couple who dined beside me.

I, not a fan of coleslaw, delight in the acidity and brightness it brings to your fatty-delicious flavors.\n\nAnd oh!, the house Durkees dressing: so reminiscent of a honey-mustard sauce!, the sauce that makes this sandwich so much more than a sandwich! Coupled with this sauce, you, dear sandwich, have that certain je ne sais quoi that makes me keep coming back for you over and over again, despite the pleas of other appealing menu items.\n\nAlongside you is Elizabeth's Caesar salad, a disconcertingly simple combination of crisp kale Romaine lettuce, shaved parmesan, and another delicious sauce concoction: black garlic dressing. Oh, were I a rich man, I would pay quite handsomely for your recipe. \n\nPerhaps someday, an evil soul with a genius culinary mind will combine your flavors of crispy-juicy chicken and pungent, flavorful garlic sauce, to create another savory sandwich. Until that day, however, I remain true to you, beloved Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.", "type": "review", "business_id": "25fxw_jOqZtJwl18cCarIA"}

Called in my order at 8PM, was told to be there in ten minutes- arrived in 15, and still waited another 10. Not a big deal, gave me time to take in the d\u00e9cor.\n\nI'm not sure why whoever opened this restaurant to sell Peruvian food and didn't bother to remodel he interior. Even just painting the red portions of the walls and trim to yellow or green, to match the logo on their business cards, would be a huge step up and be more cohesive and on theme.\n\nFinally got my food and headed home, hoping the lack of Peruvian influence in the d\u00e9cor was not going to be repeated in the kitchen. But I was at least partially surprised by the quality of the food: the lomo saltado was a plentiful portion (thankfully, as the pricetag was $14) with peppers, onions, and steak strips over an overwhelming portion of fries, served alongside white rice. The rice actually, was very good. Despite not appearing to have any seasoning, it was flavorful and moist without being \"wet\". Loved using it to soak up the extra juices from the steak and onion saut\u00e9. However, I do agree with other reviews that say that the steak could have been more tender.\nThe stuffed avocado was perhaps the most underwhelming Peruvian dish I've ever paid $7 for. The avocado was not even ripe, and the mashed potato, chicken, and mayo mixture was bland and homogenous to the point where I could not find chicken in the dish. Not sure how or why this is so highly recommended in other reviews, maybe it was just an off day.\n\nSide note: the creamy-looking red salsa sauce they have is surprisingly flavorful.. and has quite a bit of kick to it! Definitely get it but use it sparingly until you figure out if you can take the heat.\n\nEdited to add; subtracting an additional star because I got sick to my stomach shortly after posting this (about 10 minutes after finishing my meal) and I continue to feel queasy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pTNoKmIjo3BO-XDDYq8qcQ"}

But the hostess was super sweet and the wait went fast.\n\nBEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS: The cheddar-ranch dip made this dish for me, but wasn't enough to save the rings for my guy, who felt they were overly breaded and not crispy enough. Wouldn't get again but loved the sauce.\n\nHELL'S KITCHEN BURGER: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno pepper, avocado, and oven roasted tomato. Looked a bit more delicious than it actually tasted, the jalapeno is a kick in the mouth that is quickly quelled by the cold, creamy avocado and roasted tomato. Wish it came with more than one roasted jalapeno, the first bite of combined flavors was best, the rest only had one or two of the featured ingredients and came off as bland.\n\nFARM BURGER: duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. The egg makes this, but everyone else seems to say the bacon makes it. I'm not a huge bacon fan but expected to be converted by this one. Not so much. Egg yolk plus medium-rare burger was delish, cheese flavor was lost and overpowered by the other ingredients.\n\nTRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES: After the 'rings ordeal, I didn't think we needed another side but BF insisted. The order is enormous and even with our large appetites we did not come close to finishing. The truffle parm and truffle salt don't hold a candle to the amazing truffle aioli. \n\nSHAKE #5: coffee shake, chocolate pudding, \"praline cookie\". Served in one giant glass with two wide boba-style straws, this was a tasty treat. Liked that it wasn't super sweet. Praline cookie is more of a wafer without much flavor.  \n\nOVERALL:  Food didn't quite live up to the hype: bummed there isn't a mushroom burger with cheese on the menu, for the two burgers we did order, the cheese was understated. Would customize a burger on a future visit, subbing chantrelle mushrooms for the tomato on the Euro burger. The burgers are solid, and the beef is great quality, but I expected better.\n\nShout out to the hostess, who was super sweet, brought out a menu to view while in line, was the first of two staff to recommend the HK burger we ended up getting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aGbjLWzcrnEx2ZmMCFm3EA"}

Another employee came over, whispered something to her, and set out a sign closing her line after my purchase.

The other ingredients mentioned on the menu, bacon and roasted tomato? So sparingly applied that I didn't even detect them. Niyen's original description includes onion jam, and that is now missing from the menu altogether, but that bright bit of acidity would have cut through the fat and added a pop of flavor. As I ate this burger, I was asking myself why I was continuing to eat it. That's how underwhelming it was.\n\nThe bao aren't noteworthy either, though. Everyone does a pork bao so I opted for the peking duck and the tofu-mushroom versions here. Visually, the tofu-mushroom is already unappealing, with a square sheet of tofu falling out of the bao and minimal stringy mushrooms. Taste wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rave about this to any of my vegetarian friends. And the duck meat on the other bao was dry, accompanying sauce was unremarkable. Everything was very one-note.\n\nService was polite. I'll add that if you sub a salad for your side of fries (with the burger), it's literally a handful of spring mix salad blend: no tomato, no cucumber, nothing else at all added. \n\nIf using a card, payment is processed through Square (or a similar product/service), and you are presented with a tip percentage page- I'm kicking myself for selecting a $3 tip for absolutely zero service and mediocre food to boot.

The Greenies was an amazing flavor and texture adventure, and this time the Chocolate 10 Ways didn't disappoint either: highlights were the white chocolate tofu and some kind of chocolate dust that reminded me of the old-school Nestle Quik powder, except without the chemical aftertaste or weird foam at the top of my drink. Again, another dish that married various flavors and textures in a harmonious way, to great effect.\n\nService, as always, was stellar. Sitting at the bar this visit allowed us to see various dishes being prepared, and it's crazy how familiar I am with the menu to be able to identify which dish each is after only two visits.

She was just unpacking and setting up at 11AM when, and she was happy to chat with me about the company she and her mom started, baking alcohol into sweet treats fresh every morning. \n\nI opted for the PB KITCHEN SINK (cookie bottom with brownie top, peanut butter cup in the middle and on top), which was huge and delicious- BF inhaled it. Anyone allergic to peanut products should just give up on life for not being able to partake of such deliciousness.\nAlso got the IRISH STOUT- giant, fudgy brownie infused with Guiness beer and topped with a dollop of frosting. BF went nuts for this as well, as he is a chocoholic. It was a bit too much for me, but flavors were good.\nLastly, with our purchase, we got a free new item Jenny and her mom are trying out: an ORANGE CREAMSICLE cookie sandwich. It is heavenly and was by far my favorite, with sweet cookies (possibly a blondie?) that were so soft and chewy, my favorite cookie texture! The light but sweet cream between wasn't too sugary and only had a hint of orange flavor, courtesy of the Grand Marnier they are spiked with.

Their HH pricing allows you to get a good sample of the menu's food and drinks for a discounted price, available 4-7PM daily including holidays!\nAlso, you're able to order from the HH menu TO-GO, which is unheard of elsewhere- and appreciated. \n\nLOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE $9; smallish sandwich served with a veritable mountain of seasoned fries. Combining cheese and seafood is always a little dicey in my book but this dish does it well. Sadly, the fries, though plentiful and visibly seasoned, lacked flavor and crisp. They also do not reheat well, consider yourself warned.\n\nKOREAN PORK RIBS: $11, four ribs with gochujang glaze served with peanuts and mint. Or they're supposed to. Mine came sad and lonely on a plate with zero presentation. Admittedly I ordered them right before HH ended but presentation should still be consistent and the additional components likely would have made the dish much better. As it was, I wouldn't rush to order them again but did find them to be a bit meatier than expected. Flavor was one-note, sauce seemed to be sriracha-based, wouldn't order again.\n\nCINNAMON HARLOT: $7 George Dickel rye whiskey simple syrup, cinnamon. A simple sipping drink, very strong, ordered on the rocks and got a cool boulder of ice in my glass. Not wanting to be plastered after one drink, I asked for it to be diluted with Sprite, which is apparently fairly common. Decent flavor but not something I'd get again.\n\nSANGRIA: $8 red red wine, velvet falernum spiced rum, blackberry liqueur, lemon. It's rare for me to find a sangria I don't like, so I really enjoyed this drink much more than the Harlot. Fruity and strong with bold flavors, decent drink size too.\n\nService bumped up the score higher than the product alone- bartender was attentive and friendly, accommodated my HH order for takeout and fixed my drink to my liking.

I ordered to go, but standing for nearly half an hour was not ideal. Unable to determine if tables of people were waiting on food or lingering after finishing their meals.\n\nFood: maybe I didn't get the right menu items to justify the hype but they have cut a lot of popular items from the menu so a few of the things I'd had my eye on are no longer options.

Additional toppings added flavor but I was underwhelmed by the blandness of the fish itself.\nThe ahi taco-san was served on a puffy taco, which got soggy fast with the sauces and watery slaw topping.

I can't find huli huli chicken or kaluah pig very easily at all- and here, both are phenomenally well done!\n\nBut what makes this place really stand out, in addition to the tasty island flavor, is the service- when I walk into a place and am greeted by the owner himself, it means something to me. Chatted with the guy for a bit and he is clearly dedicated to this business and it's success- this is not another place where the owner is MIA and leaves a manager in charge of running things. He's right there, interacting with everyone who walks through the door. Major props.\n\nAnd the food doesn't disappoint! I was offered samples of the pork and chicken when I walked in- both were delicious, but I ultimately went with the kaluah pork salad bowl, lite on the seaweed rice, plus black beans and grilled veggies, both the corn salsa and the tomato/onion salsa, a sprinkle of cheese and cilantro, and a side of guac.\nIt was amazing. The meat is tender, plentiful and flavorful, the veggies are fresh and not overcooked, the corn salsa is mild and adds a good extra punch to the dish, and the tomato-onion salsa adds a tiny bit of heat. Don't be turned off by the \"spicy\" label, it's not bad at all. \n\nAnd the portion size is humongous. I can put away quite a bit of food, but only half of my salad. I used my fork to take additional scoops of guac every few bites, and it really added an extra dimension to the dish- the bright acidity and slight saltiness were great.\n\nIf you look closely, up by the soda dispensers, there are various bottled sauces and salsas to add that extra bit of island flavor to your dish- and they're not just a selection of various bottles. Oh no. They're Braddah's Island Style-brand bottles with what I can only assume is the company's own sauces- a pineapple jalapeno one added a splash of sweetness and spice to mine, but I steered clear of the mango habanero- sounded like a dangerous territory for my tastebuds!\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with this place. Props for the great location, too: several tourists and visitors leave the strip to get to Hash House, which is just on the other side of the corner. It stands to reason once this place builds up a reputation, that they'll be getting some of that traffic, too!\n\nGonna have to try the huli huli salad next time.

A very simple, classic dish done very well. I'd come back for that dish.\nThe DRUNKEN NOODLES: the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the portion of noodles wasn't too overwhelming.

She was so sweet and friendly, I'd love to spend time just picking her brain about culinary stuff.\n\nEvery flavor we tried blew us away. The pear and bleu cheese? Wow. The pistachio? Damn.

Every ingredient works together perfectly without being disgustingly sweet, which is what I was afraid of.\nThe black sesame sensation was my pick, and if I may say so, it was the best. The mochi totally makes this treat stand out, and it's easily something I can picture having as a treat in Japan on NYE.\nFinal flavor we tried was the extreme chocolate- which is more of a chocolate-covered strawberry flavor, since it includes the fresh fruit. Much better than expected, actually.\n\nAll the desserts were shared and devoured in record time, with extras left over and packed into the freezer for later. Portions are huge and well priced: $3.50 for a small that is easily 1.5 pints of a regular dessert portion. \n\nService was fairly good too- only two employees but both were super sweet, working together to get orders out and make sure customers were satisfied.

Definitely consider starting with an alcoholic beverage, the house margarita was tasty- I forget it's clever name though.\n\nComplimentary BISCUITS upon seating- topped with cinnamon sugar why? Would be so much better unseasoned with regular butter, as others have said.\nBRISKET CHILI- large portion, tasty, but brisket isn't as flavorful as I'd like. Adding cheese and sour cream kind of covers up some of the flavor. Cornbread is sweet, which isn't my preference.\nPULLED PORK SANDWICH- large and juicy, top bun is disposable as there's nothing on it and the bun is quite large. Not really a sandwich you can easily pick up to eat. Served with fresh-made chips, which were actually quite delicious. \nTRI SALAD- salad topped with tri-tip and grilled veggies, gigantic in size and fresh. Worth a try if you're on a salad or health-centric kick, the meat is a good portion and isn't dry, which still makes it enjoyable for a steak at a bbq joint.\nCHICKEN QUESADILLA AND GRILLED ARTICHOKE- had high hopes for this meal made of two half-size entrees, but was underwhelmed. Barbecue chicken in the quesadilla isn't particularly flavorful, despite simply being accompanied by grilled peppers and onions. LIghtly topped with a mostly-decorative design of red pepper sauce and barbecue sauce, this simply had too much going on and the chicken seemed bland, easily overpowered by everything else in the dish. Artichoke was artfully presented but a little difficult to eat, all but diehard artichoke fans need not apply.\n\nLayout is a little odd, with a street entrance and a casino entrance- on a weekend afternoon, signage at the front of the latter instructed us to go through the restaurant to the other side of the bar to the other hostess stand for seating. Having never been there before, it was difficult to find and we basically wandered the dining room until we turned the corner making the stand itself visible. Not such a great plan- maybe have staff on the lookout to escort guests to the right place.\n\nService was fairly attentive despite a shift change during our meal, bonus points for the classic Ball canning jars used as water glasses. We were seated facing the bar, which has three TV screens above it, someone please change the middle TV from cartoons- bizarre choice of programming as this isn't really a child-friendly place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xWSEfwA6L39xWTMUlWWcBA"}

Q gets away from the typical BBQ menu, instead offering various takes on fried chicken (wings, drums, and popcorn style), along with some traditional soups, noodle and rice dishes, and of course, the banchan.\n\nDOLSOT BIBIMBAP: Huge portion, definitely a comfort-food dish. The mix was extremely light on meat, with a bit more veggies, and mostly a ton of rice. Had to ask for sesame oil and sriracha to kick it up from a bland baseline, but the crunchy rice and variety of veggies made it a successful dish for me.\nSOY GARLIC WINGS: The wings here are huge, on par with drumsticks elsewhere, and coated in a thick crust topped with a sticky sauce. The flavor seemed to be more of a sweet and sour, or a honey-based sauce, and there were no notes of garlic. Though flavors weren't what we expected, the dish was still good, and we barely put a dent in the order.\nLEMON PEPPER POPCORN CHICKEN: Listed separately from the other chicken dishes, this one comes topped with a shredded green onion salad and lemon wedges, with a cold, acidic dipping sauce. This was perhaps my favorite mix of flavors at the table, as I especially enjoy green onion. The salad served to keep this fried dish on the lighter side. I do wish the dipping sauce were heated, as the coldness was a bit of an abrupt interruption to the other ingredients. \n\nEach dish had some hits and misses about it, but overall it's a place I'd recommend. Heads up that the service uses those little doorbell buttons for each table, which I don't really care for. The d\u00e9cor is an odd mishmash of styles, but I really enjoy the bubble-light chandelier that is the focal point of the dining room.

Sides of mussels, miso, orgasm salad and/or sashimi salad are also good add-ons. \n\nI'm not too big on rolls here unless I'm ordering to-go, but the Lemon roll, Crispy Spicy Roll, and Moon roll are all good picks- they have quite an extensive menu organized by specials, fried rolls, and tempura rolls and most have pictures to accompany them.\n\nFor dessert, I tend to stick to the classic green tea ice cream which is never gritty or chalky, while my BF swears by their tempura ice cream (today's special flavor was chocolate-fudge), but they also have a green tea creme brulee on the dinner menu that I've been meaning to try.\n\nAll the staff here are incredibly friendly and genuine, but Chef Soto is my favorite.

But the bell peppers were raw, and the sauce was devoid of any flavor other than spice- no garlic, no balance.

Who is a gorgeous and talented woman who is dressed like a swan for most of the play. I don't get it, but roll with it.\n\nThe epic odyssey introduces us to monkeys and warriors who teach Panda how to fight so that he can rescue her. But along the way, there is gorgeous scenery, silly moments, and some downright jaw-dropping stunts. It's gorgeous, and the animated high-def backdrop alternately adds to the drama as well as nearly distracts from it- it's innovative, that's for sure.\n\nI especially loved the disposition of the modern technology involved in making the show come together so well (lighting, sound, that backdrop!) with so many traditional dance and entertainment styles on stage- this is definitely not something you can find anywhere else in Vegas.\n\nMy middle orchestra seats were about $100/each, so it's a bit pricey, but it's one I would say is worth the splurge- be sure to try to get some pics with the cast before or after the show!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Idl2rMYaFuXYLd2vlysxiQ"}

Gourmet Hot Pocket indeed. Crust was buttered and delicious without being too thick or getting gummy, stuffings were hot and complemented one another. Menu mentions several dips it can be served with, I didn't mention one in my order but was brought a dark reddish sauce- based on taste, I could not tell if it was a light house-made ketchup or an odd barbecue sauce, but either way I did not use much of it.

The cowboy roll with seared beef on top especially caught my attention. Mega bonus points for having SIX RICELESS ROLLS! SAY WHAT!? Unheard of, and they're almost all delicious. Freshmen Roll, Spring Mountain Roll, and Tuna Naruto are my favorites in this category. The handrolls and \"burritos\" are huge and delicious- pick from the Monkey Roll or go classic with salmon skin. \n\nSide and appetizer dishes here are also pretty unique (ask for several of the mushroom ball), and the nigiri is thick-cut and delicious- appreciate how they use a proportionate amount of rice rather than gigantic mounds, as found elsewhere in town. \n\nAYCE lunch price (til 3PM) is a super-reasonable $21, dinner is open til 2AM and goes up to $27- adds extra dishes like uni and amaebi nigiri, grilled mackerel, sashimi or poke salad, and mochi for dessert.

Rich, indulgent, fatty, nothing to balance it out. Maybe adding a tiny bit of acidity and crunch would be nice? Or having a suggested side option that balances it out every few bites? I appreciate it for what it is but it isn't for me.\n\nPortions are giagantic, value is good both for size and quality of ingredients. Service was great, they checked on us repeatedly as we dined. I liked the old-school bottled sodas, we opted for a 7-Up, which went well with the sandwiches.

In theory, it's an amazing mix of bowling alley, music venue, bar, and restaurant, with separate areas for each and even a patio overlooking the hoppin' Linq area.\n\nAmelinda's review thoroughly details the pricing difficulty with their musical acts- the only way to get the advertised price and avoid miscellaneous fees is to order in person at the box office with cash. But no local wants to go to the Strip just to make a purchase unless they work nearby. \n\nI'm not a huge bowling fan, but it's a great place to do so- but a group of 6 took about 45 minutes for a single game, and at like $30/half hour not including shoe rentals, that's pretty steep. Best advice would be to include the sock/shoe fees in the lane rental for what they're asking, or bring it down about $10. I'd understand increased pricing during concerts due to demand, but going on a weekday evening the place was dead.\n\nAnd now for their food. You're on the Strip, so it's ridiculously priced. Variety is good, with some unique  appetizers including knishes and a smoked fish plate! But their \"famous\" fried chicken was too salty for me to enjoy and simply did not stand out or wow me in any way- maybe you have to be drunk or from some place other than the south.\n\nMaybe I'm a cheapskate but it's not worth dropping $100 for a couple to enjoy for date night. Props for being a one-stop shop for it all, but music would be the only thing to bring me back here specifically.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4ntvolhaYeSCbHY1dhA53A"}

I quite liked the almost barbecue-like sauce that the pork was cooked in.\n\nCarbonara ramen for myself, black garlic for my guy.\nI was pleasantly surprised by my dish- was a little apprehensive, thinking the broth would be thicker and create a texture I did not like (not a fan of alfredo sauces) but somehow it worked, being milky and flavorful without being too decadent or overly rich (though it was). Did not specify thick noodles as I initially would have preferred, but received thin and appreciated the similarity to spaghetti carbonara, added to the fusion feel of the dish overall. The bacon and fresh-ground pepper really made this dish, adding just a bit of bite to the flavor and a meaty savory element that balanced out the milky broth. And I'm not even a bacon fan! \nMy guy favored his garlic ramen- I took a few bites and it wasn't really for me, flavors were bold but seemed a little off. He has had less ramen but proclaimed that it was his favorite bowl so far, which is impressive. Egg was a bit overcooked, but overall the dish was tasty but just slightly off and almost felt incomplete, like something was missing.\n\nI will say that, despite the giant bowls and the rich broths, the ramen did not feel like an overwhelmingly heavy dinner- perhaps it has to do with the choice for thin noodles? A big bowl of ramen is good comfort food to me, but I liked not feeling the sloshing-belly-full-of-dinner feeling afterward.

Almost all special rolls are a flat $9, or they have a lunch with two basic rolls for the same price. \n\nThis spot is usually pretty empty, but always clean. Service is fine, takeout is ready fast.

Oh, and they're $14, so consider yourself warned.\nThe hefeweizen beer featured on the current menu is also damn delicious. Too bad it took 20 minutes and half of our meal to get to us.\n\nDON'T GET: \nMORGAN'S GREEK SALAD is plated poorly and difficult to cut up and eat the full romaine leaves. Only one piece of feta in the entire dish, fell off the plate due to the plating issue and was unable to eat it. The dressing was citrusy and not at all appealing. Only Greek components of this salad were the feta I couldn't eat and a handful of olives. There was no hummus in this dish as listed on menu, and the croutons were soggy.\nThe MAYOR OF FLAVORTOWN is a dry burger with pastrami of questionable quality. Somehow it looked like brisket with a dark color and odd taste. The Dijon mustard was also flavorless. Served with crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that looked and tasted like they were from the grocery store bulk bag. Did not finish.\n\nMAYBE TAKE A GAMBLE:\nDOUBLE BARREL BBQ WINGS are cut lollipop style, which was visually pleasing and easier for my bf's dad to consume, and Guy's signature bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce was neither bold nor flavorful, making it even more palatable for a guy who hates spice but couldn't find anything else on the menu he wanted to take a gamble on. Good dish for the person who ordered it, but not something I can recommend.\n\nService was also awful. As mentioned above, we waited 20 minutes for our beers. That is simply unacceptable. We also ordered a margarita that tasted like lemonade and did not seem to have any liquor in it- sent it back. Should have sent everything back, but at 1AM our options were limited, I didn't want to make a scene in front of my potential future in-laws, and quite frankly, we never saw our server.\n\nReceipt came in an iPhone holder, with the device, to complete a dining experience survey about our visit. I would have loved to. But the iPhone was out of battery and shut off. Seriously?!\n\nI am so embarrassed to have suggested this place and will not be recommending it.

The spaghetti and sauce were decent, but the meatballs themselves tasted odd, as if they were mostly breadcrumb or filler, though they didn't look it.

I believe the dish would have been significantly better if they were cooked properly. \nMECHOUI ROASTED LAMB: Very nice dish, really loved how the moist meat was complimented by the fresh mint leaves! The sea salt, cumin, and harissa sauce really added to the dish and allows you to customize the seasoning. The meat tasted more like beef than lamb though? Odd.\nMINT TEA ALMOND PANNA COTTA: Doesn't initially appear to be a panna cotta but it is surprisingly successful. The flavors all somehow work together, despite my initially being turned-off by the grapefruit on top (not mentioned in the menu description). BF inhaled this dish, really loved it. I found it enjoyable but also very odd. The mint tones in the dish almost come off as a bit medicinal.\n\nThe food was fairly tasty but did not particularly wow me. Maybe my expectations were set too high but I expected to be a bit more satisfied for the $70 dinner. Perplexed about why the couscous is not offered as a side but instead is only available as an entree.

Given all the local hype about \"oyster hour\" (5-6PM, oysters are $1/ea), we started off with that- seating in bar/lounge area is limited and awkward (very low couches/tables or two large tables for 10+?). Service was disinterested, slow, and careless, so we scaled back to just doing HH instead of a full dinner and even with those lessened expectations, food was mediocre.\n\nOYSTERS: Fine, fresh, served with a mignonette and lemon. Ordered by the dozen, tray was plopped on our table without a word. No clue what kind of oysters they were or where they were from.\nFRENCHIE BURGER: $15 at HH, and one of the menu items the restaurant has been using in publicity materials. Below average. Meat was not overcooked but dry, toppings were harmonious but very understated, overall flavor of burger was muted to the point of bland. This was incredibly boring and not worth any raves whatsoever.\nARTISAN CHEESE PLATE: Again, dropped off without a word. No clue what kind of cheeses I was eating, one was clearly a bleu variety, another seemed to be an English cheddar, who knows about the third. Accompaniments were a cranberry bread, candied walnuts, grapes, and a fruit chutney that did not remotely go with the bread. Odd assortment but good quality cheeses (thankfully!), the only good point of our visit.\n\nUnfortunately, getting some good cheese at a French restaurant is not enough of a justification for me to stick around and try more of the menu- a quick analysis of other reviews clearly shows a correlation of higher ratings with HH and dinner receiving lower ratings. I wasn't about to shell out more money for more mediocrity. What a disappointment for a Daniel Boloud restaurant- and for the Venetian in general.

I wasn't expecting much from this steakhouse, tucked away in Bally's without a celebrity chef or known brand. But they really, really deliver. Cozy atmosphere, excellently executed menu, top-notch service.\n\nPOPOVERS: A fun version of the usual free bread service, these are delightfully airy with a crisp exterior. They're served with fresh Vermont butter and salt, and you even receive a small card with the recipe. I'll just come back instead of trying to make these myself.\nDUCK LIVER PATE: A complimentary dish served to every table, this was served in a small jam jar with two small slices of bread. I like how the richness of the pate was balanced with the sweet jelly on top. An indulgent start to the meal that raised my expectations for the kitchen. \nSTEAK TARTARE: It's not the best version I've had on the Strip, but it is delicious! A traditional preparation, plated with nicely crisp country bread, this is a great starter if you don't mind a  steak app before a steak dinner.\nBURRATA: A heap of deliciously creamy yet mild mozzarella, surrounded with toy box tomatoes and accented with basil seed vinaigrette and basil leaves. Save your popovers to devour this. Add a touch of the salt from the butter, too.\nROASTED BEETS: Everyone has this on their menu these days, but BLT's comes as a salad with apple, french green beans, gorgonzola, and walnuts. BF called this the best version he's had.\nBONE-IN RIB EYE: This was heaven. Cooked and served in cast-iron, it has a thick crust and was cooked perfectly to medium-rare. The fatty bites right next to the bone are the best part, and this is served with the marrow, a tempura-fried onion ring, and a whole roasted garlic bulb. Easily one of the best steaks I've had, and at a shareable 22oz and a wallet-friendly price. After taking the first bite, BF and I knew we would be coming back.\nGRILLED LOBSTER: This is a $20 supplemental, and well worth it. Generous portion, served atop the steak, sweet and tender. I'm usually not much of a lobster fan, but I'm glad we decided to add this on.\nTRUFFLE MASHED POTATOES: Despite all the rave reviews, this didn't go over so well with us. We like truffle-accented dishes, and we like potatoes, but something about this dish just didn't work. Good, smooth texture but it's the only thing on the table we didn't finish.\nMANCHEGO WHITE GRITS: Wow. After leaving the south, it's been difficult to find great grits. Well, here they are, perfectly accented with a tasty green chile relish. I couldn't have asked for better.\nBROWNIE BITES: We were too full to order an actual dessert, but were presented with this complimentary plate, and it's perfectly sized for just a hint of sweetness after the meal. \n\nI feel like I can't fully express what a great find this is- apparently others are catching on, because the dining room was packed on a casual Wednesday evening. I recommend making a reservation if you plan to drop in during dinner hours. \n\nSnag a Groupon while they're still up ($100 credit for $70), the discount is appealing but totally unnecessary to make me return- the food alone is enough to make this a strong and frequent recommendation when seeking a nice steak dinner on the Strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ft2G2rrmtM5WwVRssrQZNg"}

I guess that's justification for the small portions. The other harbinger for our dismal dining experience was the tray of seasonings brought out with the bread plate. The food should be seasoned by the chef, not the diners.\n\nBARBARELLA: This cocktail was similar to an adult lemonade. I enjoyed the basil accents and the rather large glass, but it's not worth $15.\nWOOD ROASTED MUSHROOMS: Menu says this comes with roasted Marcona almonds and ricotta salata. They were basic mushrooms, but the thin cheese slices were a nice touch. No almonds were present.\nGRILLED OCTOPUS: Charred exterior but slightly overcooked and no seasoning whatsoever. Had to ask for lemon, which was embarrassing. Texture seemed to have been boiled to cook and then grilled to add blistering. Disappointing.\nPECORINO TARTUFO: the cheese course suggested by our server, plated with apricot preserves. A highlight! Great salty richness to the cheese with a hint of a truffle crust, the sweetness of the fruit was a good complement. But when the cheese course is one of your most memorable dishes, you're in trouble.\n\"SPICY ITALIAN SAUSAGE ARANCINI\": The name and description are laughably misleading. There is no sausage in this dish, server insisted it's in the risotto crust. Spice flavor was extremely slight. There's no reason whatsoever for the name to reference sausage if it's basically ricotta(?) cheese sticks with marinara sauce. Two thumbs down.\nROASTED BABY BEET SALAD: This was fine. Beets and goat cheese on a bed of frisee with a light dressing and some pepitas. Not bad but nothing different here.\nSTEAK TENDERLOIN CROSTINI: A surprise hit! Good balance of flavors between the thin-cut tenderloin and a mustard-esque sauce and some pickled veggies. Thick, crisp base. Seems to be a newer offering in this category.\nCOLD PEA SOUP: Completely unbalanced. Tasted like pure pureed peas, had hoped for a delicate, subtle pea flavor offset by the pancetta... but it was not. Too bold, too forceful, no restraint, would not get again.\nBACON WRAPPED DATES: Smoky, sweet, and a touch spicy. That's how this dish is supposed to play out, and it does, briefly. Then the sweetness overwhelms. Rather large portion compared to other dishes here, 6 pieces. I liked the bleu cheese crema, wish there was more of it.\nLEMON POTATOES: Crispy \"smashed\" and fried potatoes. Nice blanket of cheese atop the order, nicely done, and the portion goes farther than you'd think.\nSPAGHETTI: I don't care for the pronunciation guide for the pasta portion of the menu, but the spaghetti was decent. Attractively plated with two large and tasty shrimp and a small nest of pasta and a lemony cream sauce similar to an alfredo. As many other reviews state, $34 is a bit much for this dish. Compared to the original menu, the price has risen $6 in the past year. \nLEMONCELLO SOUFFLE: This was the dessert suggested by our server. It's presented tableside with a scoop of buttermilk gelato, which is placed atop the souffl\u00e9 to melt into the dish. I liked the lemon flavors of the souffl\u00e9, but only the topmost portion was cooked to the light, airy style characteristic of a souffl\u00e9. Rather than having a gooey center, the entire bottom half of the dish seemed to be a gritty, soupy (though tasty) mess, which wasn't helped by the melted gelato.\n\nSERVICE. Our server was polite, and suggested a few great dishes. The two-top tables for couples are small, and the plates are large, and we ordered a lot. Our table filled up quick, yet none of the bussers or servers removed our unused wine glasses, unnecessary bread plates, etc. Toward the end of our meal, service improved. It appeared our server had our table, along with another couple, in addition to a party of 10, which was a bit much for one person to handle.\n\nAfter waiting a year to experience Giada's restaurant, our dining experience was disappointingly subpar. The menu and dish descriptions are precisely our style, but many of the dishes received did not match what we were led to expect- multiple dishes were missing ingredients and others lacked seasoning altogether. Though there are a few unique dishes here (no small feat in Vegas!), too many have better versions elsewhere on the Strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "s5-VDvUqyYnD8RG3LPqnbQ"}

Opted to start with the GLASS NOODLES IN ONION SOUP ($8_, which was delicate and classic in the French style. Four thin and flavorful slices of NY Strip within the soup add just the perfect amount of flavor, making this an excellent and subtle starter dish.\nFollowed up with the chef's special, SHRIMP RISOTTO ($12), plated beautifully with an entire, enormous shrimp (possibly actually a prawn?) surrounded by delicate risotto with mushrooms. Again, delicious and subtle- Chef Hong's classical training is very much evident in each dish.\nLastly we went for the CHICKEN WINGS ($8 for 6), very lightly breaded and topped in a light sauce that was almost a glaze. Plated beautifully, again, and accompanied by daikon, which served almost as a palate cleanser.\nHad to try dessert- Ryan recommended the special CREME BRULEE ($5), using a berry popular in Asia. I can't recall it's specific name but the taste was magical, each bite literally tasted different, with notes of sweet, then bitter, sour and a touch salty throughout the dining experience. Truly an adventurous dish.\n\nFollowing our dessert, Chef Hong came out to introduce himself and ask how his dishes were received- overwhelmingly positive experience! Owner made the effort to learn our names over our visit and escorted us out the door when we left.\nStellar service and phenomenal food.

Oozing, gooey, deliciousness. The simplicity went perfectly with their parmesan wonton fries. Odd combo, but one that works.\nTHE HANGOVER:  Pretzel sliders, bro. Topped with drunken onions, grilled summer sausage, and pepper jack cheese, served with their special beer cheese spread (which I'd like to buy in bulk). This wasn't my favorite thing, but my BF really liked the meat and hints of spice. Reminded me of a pub burger.

A bit pricey at $2 per egg half but, hello, caviar. Would get this every visit.\n\nSHORT RIB SLIDERS: Perhaps the least favorite dish of the night. The meat was dry but the root beer glaze flavor was very unique. Tater tots were perfectly crisp and reminiscent of Sonic's but with a slight dusting of seasoning (not enough to call spicy) but felt with all the effort put into the other elements of the dish, the ketchup could have been spiced or at least not cold-straight-from-the-bottle-Heinz.

Rich and flavorful, meatier than expected. \nGYRO TACOS: This was a bit of a letdown. Cool concept but poor execution. The pita taco shells are super dry and floury, and the taco filling was overly seasoned to the point that it didn't even resemble lamb.\nBISON MEATLOAF SLIDERS: Awesome upgrade from the original Dr. Pepper sliders.

This week's entree options included the tempura rice bowl, the chicken ramen, and the wagyu beef burger- which they were out of by our 1PM reservation.\n\nFirst course was the VEGETABLE TERRINE- I was not expecting to like it much but it ended up being the highlight. Perfectly harmonious combination of jellied veggies with chicken and a mayo sauce on lotus leaf. BF called it one of the best things he's ever had. \n\nThe TEMPURA OVER RICE, which sounded deceptively simple, was actually pretty phenomenal: lotus root, shrimp, snap pea, mushroom, and a single amazing scallop, all atop a great brown rice with ginger. Thin batter, perfectly cooked, very well balanced, this is a dish I'd order again.\n\nSadly, it was a bit downhill from there. The CHICKEN RAMEN was thick but the broth was missing something, resulting in a flat, one-note flavor. Thick, chewy noodles, and several additional ingredients mixed in made a filling bowl.\n\nDessert was the GREEN TEA TIRAMISU- The cream layer was amazing with just a touch of sweetness, but the bottom green tea layer was very gritty. \n\nSlightly bummed to miss the burger, may try to make it again before the end of the month. Figured we were better off with the more traditional entrees but was disappointed by the dish I'd hurried here to try- the ramen.\n\nOverall, great value for the current special pricing and the intimate environment is perfect for a special event.

The much-hyped carnitas were missing any sort of wow factor, while the swordfish contained a decent portion but no discernible seasonings. The nachos ($7, + $3.5 to add shrimp) were covered in various sauces but had no spice whatsoever, and the shrimp were small and cold.

Did not care for Jose's Vespa or the Hemmingway.\n\nSTARTERS & SIDES\nFerran Adria Olives, Modern & Traditional: Got these again after loving the concept at Jaleo, but they were not as appreciated by our dining companions\n*The Classic Tartare: easily one of the best dishes we had, one I would come back for. Made tableside and seasoned to your preference, the beef sirloin comes from retired dairy cows and is supremely flavorful. \nVittore 1950 Carpaccio: accidentally received this after ordering the bison buffalo version, but kept it. A well-done classic with parmesan, croutons, capers, and sherry. I would still like to try the buffalo version eventually.\nThe Lhardy's Madrid Beef (soup): served in a tiny teacup, the consomm\u00e9, quail egg, sherry, and caviar were underwhelming. Wouldn't get this again, it doesn't really work, and I don't understand why it's on the menu.\nA simple tomato salad: There is such a thing as being too simple. Three or four cubes of various sweeter tomatoes, plus a light dressing and red onion. I liked the unusual selection of tomatoes but this dish seemed to be missing something. \n*S'mores: Homemade graham crackers and marshmallows plus chocolate and foie gras? This was a surprise hit with our more conservative dining partners! Should have asked for this at the end of the meal as it was better than the desserts we had and less fittingly placed as a starter course.\n\nMEATS\nMerino Lamb Rack, New Zealand: The version at Jaleo is better. This was unevenly seasoned, rendering some of the chops almost bland. The chimmichurri sauce Jaleo's version is plated with would have elevated this dish.\n*Wagyu Beef Cheeks: Tender and flavorful meat was complemented by the citrus and slightly-spicy mojo rojo, which I wish there was more of (as others have said). Good choice.\n*Braised Lamb Neck: Perfectly medium-rare lamb, juicy and well seasoned, plus fried oysters and fried potatoes. The oyster catsup was unnecessary because all of the other components were so well done. Recommend!\n\nDESSERT\nEverything is itty-bitty bite-sized, making our usual habit of sharing dessert difficult. The tiramisu cr\u00e8me puff disappointed the person who chose it, while the raspberry yuzu tart was interesting and fun. By far the favorite was the sea salt caramel crisp. \n\nService was friendly and informative, if a touch too casual. The tableside presentation was fun, and the guy who worked with us was personable. Note that there are three (great-sounding) tiered tasting menus, from $150/pp to $275, this information is not present on the website.\n\nPart of having the best experience here is going with the right group of people, and unfortunately the couple we dined with didn't seem to enjoy many of the items. My rating is rounded up to 4 stars from what is more accurately 3.5, as that is partially my fault. Less than half of our dishes (admittedly mostly classic options) were wonderful, while the other half was disappointing.

Lamb was the favorite at the table, scallop version was overpowered by pork taste with a slight seafood aftertaste. Juicy, cooked well, wouldn't pay $10/6 pieces though.\n\nNOODLES: The Lo Mein, Dan Dan Mian, and Beijing tomato dishes were all tried at our table and each had their own advantages. Lo Mein was my personal favorite due to the chewy texture and tasty sauce, while the Dan Dan could have used more spice to perk it up. The Beijing tomato dish was fairly unique- felt it could have used a more pronounced black garlic flavor by using oil rather than the actual garlic, which was only present in a few bites and used more as a garnish than a flavor-enhancing ingredient.\n\nRICE: Hakka Fried Rice pot was delicious, available in two sizes and made table-side. Tasty combination of flavors and textures made this the standout entree of the table.  Would come here to get this again.\n\nDESSERT: table customized two bowls (one small, one large) of the shaved ice. You select one ice flavor, one syrup, and three toppings including some more unique options like bacon and maldon salt (which I certainly wouldn't pair together). The combinations we put together resulted in an enjoyable confusion for our tastebuds as raspberry ice and honey interacted with perfectly-ripe blueberries in one and the crispy-rice texture dominated in the other dish. Ice texture was perfect but melted very quickly, so do not lollygag around after it arrives.\n\nOverall impression was that the food was decent enough- noodles were tasty, other ingredients were of good quality, but the word 'fusion' is tossed around in many of these reviews and the food simply seems to be an Americanized take on many of the dishes, but that's not necessarily a negative.

Menu is fairly extensive with a few different types of ramens, a handful of sides, add-ons, tapas options, and a few desserts.\n\nJINYA BUN is $3 (~$4 regular) on HH menu- chashu on a bao, simple, classic, flavorful, and delicious. The tempura BRUSSELS SPROUTS were crispy and fresh with a touch of truffle oil that didn't overwhelm but added an extra savory note.\nCRISPY RICE WITH SPICY TUNA is a favorite dish of mine: I'm not a jalapeno fan but the thin slices are the perfect complement to the tuna and rice, which is perfectly crisp and never burned.\nCRISPY CHICKEN is super-moist and flavorful, plated with a small salad with their fabulous dressing and a delightful dipping sauce.\n\nRAMENS:\nTONKOTSU ASSARI- pork broth, chashu, karagge, green onion, seasoned egg, spicy bean sprouts, and thick noodles: delish! Broth had good depth of flavor without feeling too fatty (server described it as one of their lighter options), noodles were chewy and the egg was just slightly overcooked.\n[2nd visit] TOKOTSU BLACK- pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori, egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and THIN noodles: full bodied broth, but highly preferred the thicker noodles, the thin ones are too similar to spaghetti IMO.\n[Millionth Visit] SPICY CHICKEN TONKOTSU: amazing noodles with a spicy broth and ground chicken. No egg. Reminiscent of a lighter version of Sora's spicy ramen bowl but without the heavy grease of Fukumimu's tan tan men.\n\nVery pleased with food and service- so much so that I went two days in  row.\n Affordable pricing (see receipts in pics).

Mediterranean is my favorite cuisine, and this place was highly recommended to me, so I saved this spot for a special occasion and made a reservation for my birthday. The decorative touches of the dining room are thoughtful well put together, but most of the dishes were not. The tapas dishes we started with were great, but instead of escalating to a crescendo with great entrees and dessert, those dishes disappointed. \n\nFALAFEL: Heralded in other reviews as one of the best versions in town, I had high hopes for this dish and I was not disappointed.

So many flavors in this mix of vegetables, but considering it's placed in the \"wood fired\" category of the menu, I would have liked a bit of char to the eggplant or onion.

BF loves pickled foods but we both found this combination of vegetables odd and unsatisfying. Remove from the menu.\nCHICKEN TAGINE: Here's where things started to head south.  Rice was a touch overcooked and almost mushy, chicken was flavorful and well-seasoned but a bit overcooked and dry. Small mistakes, but ordering this dish felt like a big mistake.\nGRILLED OCTOPUS: Probably the most-recommended dish in other reviews, this fell completely flat for me. The actual octopus was overshadowed by the giant cloud of shredded celery atop the dish, and the portion size was small (even compared to others in town) and lacked flavor. The octopus was only slightly charred but had little to no seasoning. I enjoyed the potatoes and lemon vinaigrette more than the actual octopus. The version at Bazaar Meats is miles better, and it's not even the best version in town (Jaleo holds that honor). This can't possibly be the same octopus dish others raved about unless they've never had it before.\nSCALLOPS: Another case of small mistakes. The scallops were slightly rubbery and did not have an adequate sear, indicating that they were not cooked on high enough heat. The piquillo-almond puree and brown butter accents were wonderfully harmonious, but not enough to make up for the star of the dish falling flat. \nFIG & ALMOND PANACOTTA: I love a good custard, and this was nicely creamy and paired well with the figs... but the delicate, balanced flavors were overshadowed by the harsh amaretto poured on top. Cooked down into a more mellow syrup, this would have been much better but instead it was borderline offensive. We did not finish this.\n\nIt soured my mood a bit that I made note of my birthday when making my reservation and not once was it acknowledged or mentioned in any way- not even when the information was pulled up as we were greeted. Our server was nice, but the dishes she recommended to us were the most expensive ones we ordered and the most underwhelming. At the end of our meal, she never came back after dropping off the bill; eventually a manager stepped in to check us out. \n\nIt's a gorgeous space and I might consider coming back for a few of the smaller dishes, but I was extremely disappointed with my overall experience- we enjoyed less than half of what we ordered and were virtually forgotten by our own server.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XqpUYK7tjHe_gi0BrNf1sw"}

I ordered it, but it never arrived. More on this later, as service is why my rating is not higher.\nCRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS: with balsamic soy reduction, green onion, and toasted almonds. What the heck?! These sprouts are flipping delicious. Didn't see this coming, but the sauce perfectly complements the roasted veggie, and the onion and almonds add texture. Going to try to replicate this dish at home!\nSALMON SASHIMI WITH CAVIAR: fresh, flavorful salmon wrapped with onion chutney, topped with caviar, and placed on a slice of cucumber. The artful presentation was as good as the flavor. Be sure to use the accompanying lemon wedge, as the burst of acidity elevates the flavors.\nTIGER ROLL: Only Katsuya can put shrimp tempura, truffle oil, and caviar in my sushi- AND make me like it!

Seems odd that they couldn't keep up with that.\n\nService issues aside, the food was underwhelming.\nThey offer a $14 half-sando, half-soup lunch combo with chips and a \"dessert\". The eggplant pastrami sandwich looked impressive but had an overwhelming peppery taste to it, as if that's the only thing it was seasoned with. The tomato and mozzarella salad was a miniscule portion, but good flavor: one slice of mozz chopped into quarters and half a tomato. Chips were seasoned, dessert was a cookie from a Costco tray.\nJust because I've heard so much about it, I added on an order of the dirty mac. This was decent- hearty, cheesy, and saucy. I'm not a fan of peas but they work in this version. That said, I detected no Ritz but the flavors were okay. Wasn't wowed.\n\nInterior is nicely decorated, and I dig their chalkboard menus over the butcher area. The bar is simple, industrial-style, and they have some outdoor seating facing Alta.

Even the bleu cheese dipping sauce, while totally unnecessary because the chicken itself was delicious, was good.\nCRAB ARTICHOKE DIP: This was tasty, decent amount of meat combined with a \"lemony mayo\" that gave it a bit more flavor than other versions. Served with thin triangles of flatbread, but we mostly at it with the aforementioned tortilla chips.

Portion is small to match the $5 price tag. Guac was fresh, pico was boring and bland.

Apartment size is meant to feed 2 (roughly $15), with a larger family size available too. If you're just a couple, I'd get two individual size pies with different crusts until you find your favorite.\n\nService was friendly from owner and cashier.

Well, not any more.\n\nCame in late at night, again to blasting music and flashing lights. It's telling that every single one of their customers opted to sit outside on the patio. I noticed that the regulars weren't ordering any food. Menu has added American and Mexican food options like burgers, nachos, and burritos. I understand that they're trying to pull in more business, but it brings to mind the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" phrase.\n\nWe ordered four dishes: cabbage pirozky, vinaigrette, julien, and the Olivier we fondly remembered from last time. The pirozky were the only item that were okay, and they were not made in house. The vinaigrette tasted like a basic salad of pickled vegetables. There was minimal beet in a dish that is supposed to be beet-based. The julien looked like a soup in the menu photo but what we received was like a personal pizza, topped with mozzarella and mushrooms. It's hard to find those flavors unappealing, but that is NOT julien. They apparently cannot make the dishes on their menu.\nAs for the Olivier? It was flat-out disgusting. It looked congealed, as if it had been sitting out, exposed to air, for hours. Flavor was completely off and just bad. We took one bite, and immediately asked for the bill.\n\nAs for the service? Our server was a very sweet lady. But she knows nothing about Russian food. We voiced our concerns and she reported back to the kitchen and owner, but no one ever came out to speak with us. Our basic order took 40 minutes, and we were the only table ordering and most of the dishes were premade. To top it off, a group of regulars brought in a blow up doll in with them.

Not sure why that layout was chosen over offering table service. Pricing is fair on most items, but some need to come down: $8-10 for a wrap without a side is a little steep considering the fast-casual setup they chose to implement.

Do your homework and pack light, or check your bag online ahead of time for $30 and bring your own snacks in your carry on. It's not that damn hard, people.\n\nSERVICE: Gate crew were informative and timely about updates and gate changes on the ground, but the in-air crew weren't as forthcoming. We sat on the runway for an hour without any sort of explanation or communication from the cockpit, other than a vague \"we'll be on our way soon, folks!\" after 45 minutes. I wasn't thrilled.\n\nIN-FLIGHT COMFORT: Seats were standard, but there was a surprising amount of leg room, on par with Jet Blue! This was a pleasant surprise. \n\nIN-FLIGHT FOOD: Like a few other airlines, snacks and drinks are available for purchase. But surprisingly, they're priced well with Frontier. Obviously, the more you buy, the more you save, but their 2-drinks-2-snacks combo for $8 is downright cheap when you consider the alternatives (purchasing in the airport after security).\n\nIN -FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT: I was surprised to see the built-in screens as I entered the plane. BF purchased access and asked for free headphones, as instructed in the flight guide. Flight attendant said they were out, no way to refund his purchase or turn on captions. She also revealed that they are removing the screens soon, as if that's some sort of explanation.\n\nBAGGAGE: The website is very clear about carry-on baggage rules and how to avoid paying increased fees for checked luggage. I packed mine and my BF's stuff in one bag and paid my $30 in advance. When I printed my ticket at the airport kiosk, my bag didn't fit in the display luggage holder. \"Ha!\" I thought, \"I made the right call!\" Uh, wrong-o. My bag easily fit under the seat in front of me and was under the weight limit by 15 pounds , so I should have been able to consider it my only carryon. Surprise, there's no way to get a refund on that, either.\n\nPRICE/VALUE: When considering the above, factor in an extra $30+ per person, and if the ticket price is still significantly cheaper, seriously consider Frontier. Put this airline at the top of your list if you pack light and/or will only be gone for a weekend (ie less luggage).", "type": "review", "business_id": "WjtmPE2n9pCtrLu7FmMKRQ"}

I don't see myself being a regular customer, and I wasn't thrilled with the lack of contact with customer service, but flavors and portions are better than they appear.\n\nIssue #1: my order arrived 24 hours late. Scheduled for 12/15, not received by 10PM, no email notifications and no way to track. I confirmed that they took money out of my account and that I had the delivery date correct. There's no way to contact anyone directly, but if there's a delay with your order, the FAQ page says to email their support department the following day (implying that this is fairly common?). Convenience of preordering is irrelevant if they can't keep to stated delivery time and I end up without lunch/dinner, waiting an extra day. So far no one from the company has acknowledged the delay or even reached out with a form letter or link for feedback.\n\nIssue #2: Full disclosure: I ordered with their half off promo. I can't imagine anyone paying $10/meal for this. It's essentially TV dinners, one step removed from the Atkins line. The food doesn't look appetizing and it literally arrives frozen solid, further lending the comparisons to your grocery-store aisle food. Fresh =/= frozen. The cook times are not accurate- all of meals needed at least an additional minute, if not double the listed time just to get heated through. I'm aware that there can be cooking variations with microwave wattage and elevation, but this is ridiculous. Food is icy inside when following directions.\n\nTHE POSITIVES:They offer large menus of over 40 breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals each week, and I like that you can fully customize each meal instead of just in pairs like with other services. But the food is not exciting and service so nonexistent, it's not worth the price or arguable \"convenience\". Note that you have to join, order, and check a specific page, then download a PDF simply to view calorie counts or additional nutrition info. Not sure why this isn't just printed on the label. However, counts are very reasonable for portion size.\n\nTIP: After placing your first order, immediately put a hold on all additional weeks until you try and decide if you want to continue. Freshly one requires NINETY-SIX hours (four whole days) notice in order to change or cancel any service, which is barely enough time to even eat what they ship before another one is on it's way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Grjmw1QeFXZTdh5z5U7aZA"}

The lamb ribs are frickin' delicious and my juicy burger was, too. Some kinks to work out as a new business, but I'll be back to try more menu items soon, no doubt about it.\n\nFOOD: Menu is burgers and ribs. Duh. The aforementioned lamb ribs are what they recommend most, and with damn good reason. They're flavorful, they're juicy, they taste great. The Old Skool burger (American, mustard, pickles, onion, BBQ, and aioli) is classic, juicy perfection. Meats are really good quality, cooked just right. \n\nBEVERAGES: Wine, beer, \"craft bottled sodas\" and Fiji water available only. We were told tap water wasn't available yet the table next to us was offered some after they finished their beers. Other tables had a (probably lower-priced) generic water bottle yet we weren't offered other options than the small, room-temperature Fiji. Not really a fan of the inconsistency, just let me have iced water. Snag a can of Fosters to keep the Aussie spirit flowing.\n\nSERVICE: Mostly friendly staff, management welcoming folks at the door, that's what I like to see! Line at door was backed up, moved slowly. Guy at register was easily distracted and took several minutes to take our simple order. Food took 40+ minutes to come out, I won't count this against them unless it's still that backed up when I return in a month. Expediting and streamlining the kitchen takes time with a new business, I get that.\n\nPRICING: For the few other reviews whining about pricing, ribs are not budget food in the first place. The $18 rack of lamb was priced just right, IMO. Burger was under $10 but some went up to about $14. Still not outlandish, our dinner was right over $30. Considering the other options in this area AND the quality, they're not overpriced.\n\nTrying the lamb burger and the beef ribs on our next visit, hoping for a seat on the patio while the weather is still nice.

These are some damn near perfect fries, but I was expecting some sort of distinct \"duck fat\" flavor and didn't really pick up on one. The tomato jam seems to just be a house-made ketchup with a bit of spice to it.\nSTRAWBERRY + CHAMPAGNE + WALNUT + GOAT: It's a salad, fresh for summer. Instead of goat cheese crumbles or large circles, the cheese is served as a \"fondue\" on the plate. I found the sauce a little light on flavor and missed the texture it usually brings to a salad.\n\"COBB\" SALAD: Good portion, $6 for HH. Very fresh, lots of ingredients, cut to the proper size, and something I would get again even though it's far from a unique dish.\nTUNA + RADISH + TARO CHIPS + SPICE: The taro chips are huge and provide great texture. The poke itself was spicier than I expected but was exceptionally fresh. Not sure I'd get this again though. \nEGGS + BACON \"PORK BELLY\": Cue the hallelujah choir! Perfectly poached egg, generous and thick cut of pork belly, drizzled with a delightful hollandaise with a slight sweetness to it, all atop a thin slice of toast.

Made with very little filler, allowing the simple ingredients to shine. Server said this also had a Tabasco tobiko that I really enjoyed. Pretty pricey though at $17 regularly, a steal at $10 during HH.\nSHORT RIB \"HARLOT\" + HORSERADISH + FRIED ONION: It looked dry and didn't have much sauce, but was very tender and shredded easily. The fried onions and butter potatoes were simple but perfectly executed. \nSWEET HEAT SQUID: Calamari in a sweet and sour sauce, with julienned apples. Fresh, good variety of textures, generous portion for HH. BF really enjoyed this.\nSHRIMP GRITS: Not a great version. Several shrimp, bland sauce, overcooked grits. This was a bit saucier than I liked and needed seasoning. Would not get this again, it's on the HH menu and I think it's priced appropriately there.\nMUSSELS: The broth was missing something, but was nicely fragrant with a large portion. The accompanying garlic bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Would get this again.\n\nThe food is pretty decent. Bar staff are friendly, but I have twice been assigned to a server who waited nearly a half hour to show up at my table, and nearly as long to bring the check.

Pressed for Juice has it all and then some!\n\nSERVICE: Go in and you'll be offered a juice tasting! Cute tiny cup, little pours of each flavor, the full attention of an employee, actual service! I was attended to by two different ladies, both of whom were genuinely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I've literally never had such great service at a juice place!\n\nPRODUCT: With 20+ drinks to choose from, all with clever names (Gin & Juice, Soup Dog, Threesome, Sweetie Pie, etc), an ingredient list, and the purported benefits of the combined fruits and vegetables, there's something for everyone. Three or four different green juices with a range of sweetness, various spicy juices with cayenne and jalapeno, several fruity concoctions, and three different nut milks.\n\nPRICING: Bottled, cold press, non-HPP juice will run you an average of $8-13/bottle in most major cities, Vegas is no exception. Prices here are in the average range but they have several ways to get discounts: Happy Hour is the last 2 hours of every day, and gets you 10% off your order; they run various promotions on FB and Instagram; and you can use a stamp card for a free drink with every 10 bottles purchased! \n\nPressed fulfills all of my requirements in a juice place- other than being far away from my house.

Fish is fresh but the rolls themselves are basic, nothing special, and a little overpriced. Stick to classic apps like gyoza or edamame. \n\nService from bartender Jacqueline was friendly and quick, overall the staff seems to run a tight ship and everyone was in a really positive mood.

While I enjoyed this dish (hello, cheese and tomatoes with bread, what's not to love?!) and the criminally smooth texture, the flavors were a bit too subtle: cheese was mild to the point of being almost flavorless and the pickled tomatoes lacked any sort of vinegary or briney \"pickled\" taste. \nFURIKAKE STREET CORN: I'm not a huge corn fan, but I ordered this dish because it's getting rave reviews. It was just okay. A bit too much oil, but nicely charred kernels and interesting seasonings. \nWATERMELON & FETA SALAD: If the word \"feta\" is in the dish name, I expect more than a scant half-tablespoon in the entire salad. The salty, creamy notes that the cheese adds to this dish were almost nonexistent due to the skimpy portion used.

None of the dishes I ordered really lived up to the hype, or to the restaurant name. Perhaps dessert is where the gluttony kicks in: the PB&C and profitroles both sound great, I'll have to come back another time to find out.\n\nETA: It's not going to change my rating or anything, but the \"Buy a round for the kitchen for $5 to show your appreciation\" on the menu is extremely tacky.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0ng1b8buaqJ7deuiDxMWFg"}

Didn't see one, but hope they add a cold brew to the menu. This area needs some perking up and Illumillate is a nice start.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star.

The brisket wasn't their best item on the menu, but I'd keep Bell's in mind if I were on this side of town again.\n\nMenu features the choice of a meat plate (8oz with two sides, house-made pickles, and Texas toast) or a sandwich, and you can add on additional meats (~4oz?), as they don't have multi-meat combo plates. Sides of mac and greens were just okay.\n\nPORK BELLY: The highlight. Was surprised to see it on the menu, but it ended up being the best thing. Tender, falling apart, juicy, and full of flavor. Wish I'd just ordered this!\nBRISKET: Close, but no cigar. Nicely seasoned with visible smoke ring, but the meat itself was dry and hard in spots. I suspect this is because it wasn't all that fresh, being that they're new and not quite so busy yet. I'd give this another try on a future visit.\nPULLED PORK: No. This was the oddest meat in the meal, cut into odd pieces and drowning in sauce, portion also seemed smaller than the others. Meat was very tender but sauce was overly sweet, did not care for this at all.\nRIBS: Got the St. Louis style, add-on. They're large and meaty, but BF found them a bit too fatty for his liking. I'd get them again, but kind of wish they came sauced, as the cups provided for takeout make it an odd fit for dipping the bone without making a mess. Pleasantly surprised with these!\n\nDESSERTS. I'm not big on desserts, but I couldn't resist the cute jar presentation! Opted for the cashier's favorite, the S'mores. The graham cracker crust bits were on the clumpy side, but the rich, chocolately mousse tasted just like hot chocolate and the browned marshmallow fluff on top was nicely subtle.\n\nService was welcoming and friendly, interior is clean and modern with country d\u00e9cor touches- love the strands of lights above the dining room!

It's like a paste coating every skewer, to the point where you can't even taste the meat. Whoever's in the kitchen needs to chill on the seasoning.\nMACARONS: These were a surprise!

The sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures.\nCRISPY CAULIFLOWER: The breading is super-thin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. One of the better versions I've had, not greasy!\nPARM-TRUFFLE FRITES: You know you want them. They smell great, but let's get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right?

Nicely creamy filling.\nCRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS: You can't go wrong with ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. One of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above.\nPB&J SLIDERS: The dish I was most excited about and the only one I was underwhelmed by. Menu only states \"blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon\" and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word \"slider\" as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challa-style bread. It's actually 3 typical sliders (mini patty and bun) with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. With less PB and more J, this might have been palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.\n\nAll of this, with a beer and tip, for ~$40 can easily feed three.

Glad to see that Caf\u00e9 6 has tasty burgers and a total turnaround in the service department- but the cuisine doesn't really fit the spa-like locale. That said, I'd still keep this spot in mind for a great burger.\n\nFRIED PICKLES: These are spears instead of the expected chips, perfectly crisp and served with a trio of dipping sauces (an acidic ranch, a sweet bbq, and a spicy sriracha). Interesting presentation features vinegar chips under the pickles? \nTHE WEDGIE: More like a wedge salad mated with a BLTA sandwich, minus the bread. Presentation deconstructed the wedge to more manageable pieces,  with generous amounts of avocado and bleu cheese, two slices of bacon. One of the few fresh/healthy options, lots of textural contrast, would get again.\n\nMINI BURGERS\nTURKEY SNACK: Turkey burger with lettuce, avocado, swiss, and apple-cranberry marmalade on a Taro bun. The purple taro bun is fun and slightly sweet, tastes like a Hawaiian roll. This is a great turkey burger, surprisingly juicy.\nBACON BLEU: Angus patty with bacon (allegedly, didn't detect any on ours?), bleu cheese sauce, LTO, on brioche bun. Lovely buttery bun and an incredibly strong sauce, burger was juicy, a bite of perfection.\nTOADSTOOL SWISS: Angus patty with roasted portabella, caramelized onion, lettuce, swiss, Dijon mustard, house-made ketchup. The burger I'd most anticipated was underwhelming. Portabella lacked flavor, mustard didn't really harmonize with other ingredients, small chopped onions were falling all over the plate and didn't stay on the burger.\n\nFULL-SIZE BURGER\nDR. PEPPER SHROOM BURGER: Huge, thick Angus patty with roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onion, Dr. Pepper glaze, Dijon mustard on brioche bun. The full sized burgers are gigantic! Aside from our cooking issues (below), the sweet Dr. Pepper glaze worked better than expected and added to the mushrooms' savory meatiness. Really enjoyed the flavors of this burger. \nWAFFLE FRIES: These are perfectly crisp and wonderfully seasoned, served with a spicy ketchup with a lot of kick. I ate way too many of these, enjoying them more than any other version in recent memory.\n\nNUTELLA DONUTS: Puffy donut holes, dusted in cinnamon-sugar and served with a trio of sauces (the cr\u00e8me anglaise being my favorite). Nutella filling was a good amount, not overflowing, happy my BF pushed to order these despite my not being a dessert fan.  \n\nI recommend the Trio of Sliders ($14), which allows you to try more burger styles, though the giant patty of the full-size burger is a good value. The sliders were cooked perfectly, whereas our full-sized burger was served first overcooked (to well done) then redone to practically rare. If you're charging $15/burger, every one should be cooked perfectly- an area to improve upon.\n\nService was fairly good: lots of positive staff around to check up on us, they had no problem remaking our burger or upselling drinks, apps, and desserts. Now if only they could get people in the door! Despite a Friday evening date-night, there were few diners here and they were mostly older groups. Location away from the casino floor plus $15 burgers (pricey for some) doesn't really help.

This salad alone could easily be a lunch, packed with fish (not just skin), fruit, and an ample amount of fresh veggies in a light, flavorful dressing. Nice variety of textures, too.\n3 ROLL COMBO: This option allows you to pick three special rolls, and get bottomless miso soup, house salad, and dessert (various ice creams) for a crazy-low $26, which is easily enough food for two people but at a cost that rivals the AYCE pricing elsewhere. The miso was standard but the house salad was the first I've come across in an Asian restaurant that included avocado!

The mushroom cream sauce is delicious, I just wish there was more of it. Portion is huge, given sides are wild rice and glazed carrots. I subbed the mac for the rice since that dish is rarely remarkable anywhere.

The chicken for both was super-juicy without being greasy, but the breading didn't adhere very well and the chicken itself didn't have much flavor. I appreciate that the blue cheese on the Bluebird is more of a sauce than crumbles, allowing for more even distribution of flavor.\n\nSIDES: A small is just under $4, while a large is just over $7. Steep. Mashed potatoes didn't taste instant but also weren't worth the price. The small fry is a huge portion of skinny-cut seasoned spuds, great for sampling all of their dipping sauces!\n\nDIPPING SAUCES: BRBQ (bourbon-tinged barbecue), Chipotle honey (possibly my favorite), habanero hot (is hot), wasabi honey (very slight wasabi flavor), and a couple of others.

I'm not generally a soda fan, but there was no button for water so I sampled a few and was surprised to really enjoy them. The ginger ale, cr\u00e8me soda, lemon-lime, and black cherry, in that order, were my top picks. There were a few I didn't try.\n\nSERVICE. Here's where I'm torn on what to rate this place. I understand I went on their second day, but I experienced a few hiccups (charged incorrectly, then brought the wrong order). However, management was quick to apologize and fix the issues, and the service from one employee in the dining room in particular was awesome. Rounding up for that dude.\n\nOverall, this spot is a bit overpriced for what you get, but it's in downtown Summerlin so no one's really surprised. Recommend the wing lunchbox combo (5 wings, fries, and a drink for $8) for a better value, only available 11-3PM, Mon-Fri.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star. Returned for another visit, still had issues with my order. This time I didn't bother bringing it to their attention. You've been open two months and the kitchen still doesn't know the menu?

The Tuesday dinner special is a country-fried steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, which was generously sized and solid for the low $11 price tag. We couldn't resist adding on a bowl of their matzoh ball soup with challah, which was surprisingly meaty for $8. \nWe wanted to share a dessert, but upon asking to see the menu, we were handed our bill- guess that makes the decision for us, huh?\n\nUnfortunately, the subpar service kind of ruined it for me. Regulars were enthusiastically greeted, and we were helped in a polite and competent manner, but odd delays (20 minutes between courses, 10 to run our card, the dessert thing) made things a bit frustrating.

However, quality here is among the best AYCE I've had and the majority of lower-priced businesses in town have significantly lower quality to match.\n\nAPPETIZERS: This was our favorite section of the menu. The Jalapeno Popper dish that is commonly found around town was nicely presented here and actually had a good kick of spice for once! Salmon poke had a great spicy chili sauce, both were offset by the seaweed salad. We really enjoyed the grilled mackerel and the soft shell crab, but I did not care for the oysters. The real standout was the Rock N Roll appetizer, which is a riceless roll! \nNIGIRI: Nigiri selection was ample, and fish was typically pretty fresh. The super white tuna, scallop, golden eel, and squid were good options, but I felt the salmon and yellowtail weren't that great and lacked flavor. Rice was an average portion, fish was cut on the thin side.\nROLLS: We tried the Twilight roll and the White Dragon roll, both had several sauces and fishes, both were tempura-shrimp based. I generally try to be more adventurous with my roll picks but by this point I was too full to care. Rolls were solid and they had a lot of new specialty options, but I wish they had more riceless options.\n\nThe space was another sushi spot before Hanabi took over, but the modern, clean d\u00e9cor and chalkboard specials menu are a bit different. Service at the bar was attentive and we were frequently checked on by both chefs and management, though our empty dishes stacked up- this didn't really bother me, as they were pretty busy.\n\nFor those who are outraged by the higher AYCE price here- if $3 is really a deal breaker for you to drop your rating over, you have no business coming here. Stick to the Dollar Menu. The quality of dishes, freshness of fishes, and variety on the menu are more than enough to warrant the difference in cost.\n\nTIP: Follow them on social media for a 50% off coupon for November & December for a la carte orders (good lunch option).", "type": "review", "business_id": "FJzX7tyXP6Dlo2POut-ZSQ"}

The frank seemed light it might have been sitting out for a bit, and there was a ton of guac. Usually this is a good thing (and a good value!) but the guac itself didn't have much flavor and overpowered the other toppings.

The drink menu is larger than that other spot in town, and everything we had was tasty. Standouts include the Hotel Nacional (subtle and less fruity), Bamboozled (love the use of thai basil, but this drink was packed with ice!), and the Banana Batida (one of their two drinks featuring Dole Whip and the favorite of our group). Drinks are a flat $11/each unless you get a souvenir mug, and they have a full bar to order other drinks if the tropical ones don't appeal to you (heathen!).\n\nParking can be tight in this lot, so utilize their free valet parking behind the building.

Grabbed takeout at 11:30AM on a weekday, and the food was disappointing. Maybe we came on an off day, but it was hard to find anything to like, though we were unable to try the ribs, which sound like their best meat option.\n\nSERVICE:  An hour after opening, they were out of ribs. When my boyfriend  expressed surprise, she said \"this happens every day.\" Uh, basic supply and demand would then suggest you make more. W e'd planned to split a three meat plate. Now, with only brisket and chicken left, we'd have to double up on one. To do so, we were charged an extra $7 for the double brisket. This is ridiculous, and we were put in the position to do so by the lack of other available meats. Takeout box was put  on the counter, had to get bags and utensils separately. If the majority of your orders are for takeout, perhaps someone should be bagging up orders appropriately.  Just a thought.\n\nTHE FOOD\nBRISKET: My initial thoughts were complimentary. But as we got away from the edges of the piece of meat and into the interior, the meat became dry and unappealing. The brisket was the best of what we tried, but we didn't finish it.\nCHICKEN: It was fall off the bone tender, but lacked flavor and was also on the dry side. This went unfinished as well.\nMAC AND CHEESE: I found it interesting, and kind of fun, that they used bowtie pasta for the mac. But it was falling apart and the only flavor seemed to be from the seasoing sprinkled on top. The first few bites were fine, but again, as we got more into the dish and the noodles broke into pieces and the seasoning was gone, flavor was very one note. I do like that they were nicely saucy (dry mac is the worst offense!), but this version was lacking.\nSAUCES: Okay, even average bbq can be made to shine with a good sauce. BF grabbed two different types for us to try and both were gross. One was sickeningly sweet with a chemical-like after taste we couldn't place, while the other (the Godfather?) was similarly sweet but with a punch of pepper. This wasn't balanced, it was just pepper. No bueno!\n\n I may be from Texas and used to great bbq, but after two years in Vegas, I've scaled back my expectations-- and even so, this spot didn't meet them.  Perhaps I'd feel differently if I tried the ribs everyone raves about, but I don't feel inclined to give them another try for a while.", "type": "review", "business_id": "p3yLSaTih0w10gqXWkuslA"}

These were simple but good.\nWOODEAR MUSHROOMS: BF picked this dish, and he liked it. I did not care for the jellied texture of the mushrooms. These were seasoned with a slightly-spicy sauce and a lot of lemongrass. \nCRISPY SHRIMP IN GARLIC OIL: Five crispy shrimp,  with a savory chopped mushroom topping, nicely cooked. I did not care for the \"garlic oil\", as it did not have much flavor and lent the dish a greasy feel. \nPORK AND SHRIMP SHUMAI: These were served in the steamer baskets, and had thicker skins than I am used to.

I was excited about this spot opening but hesitant to visit given the generally-underwhelmed reviews, but their claims of freshness eventually tempted me through the door. \n\nBURGERS: The menu lists single- and double-burgers for each style, I opted for the classic and realized why. The patty thickness is somewhere between White Castle and Dollar Menu Double. Props for offering a lettuce-wrapped version. Beef version, like all the other reviews, lends itself to a less-favorable comparison to that West coast chain. The turkey burger retained a surprising juiciness and the toppings were fresh.\nFRIES: The regular variety are lightly salted, but if your a fan of spice, opt for the Flippin' Spicy style. I openly admit that these were WAY too spicy for me, with tons of chopped grilled jalapenos in every nook and cranny. These were perfectly topped too: so much cheese and pepper that it was difficult to find bare fries, even at the bottom. A win for most people, a lose for me, because it rendered the dish inedible, but this is entirely my fault.\nCONCRETE:  A few specialty versions for a sweet dessert treat, BF opted for the Brownie Delight, whose chocolaty tones were reminiscent of a Frosty, in a good way. The 10oz small is just the right size and the bits of brownie blended in added a nice texture that didn't take away from the overall creaminess.\n\nService was quick and cheery, space is clean and welcoming with framed, mirrored windows on the walls lending a farm-house feeling.

I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business.

Diner-style setup with Asian d\u00e9cor touches like a dragon on the ceiling and matching lions at either side of the door, a menu that boasts both Southern staples and Chinese dishes, and friendly service. Somehow, it works.\n\nCRAB RANGOON DIP: A tasty deconstructed version of the dish. Not much crab in the dip itself, but the flavors worked and the fried eggroll skins as chips was fun.\nKINDA CHINESE RIBLETS: Super tender, drowning in a hoisin barbecue sauce. Mixed feelings on this. BF and I didn't enjoy these as much as we were expecting to.\nCRISPY SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN: Moist meat, crispy skin, dusted with what seemed to be ranch dressing powder? Odd but tasty, it added saltiness that the dish needed. Cornbread muffins were painfully dry, and I don't understand why the chicken is served on sliced white bread? I really appreciated that the batter on the chicken wasn't very thick. Ultimately this dish was just okay.\nSRIRACHA MAC AND CHEESE: Elbow noodles, cheese, a hint of spicy sauce, and everything nicely offset by a green onion garnish. I liked this more than I expected to, having mostly ordered it because of the low $3 price tag. \n\nService was fast and friendly. The southern portion of the menu (save for the cornbread) seems to be executed better than the Chinese. I'm sure the menu will change a bit as they settle in and see what works and what doesn't.

Artisan Foods has outdone themselves! I dig the concept: selling specialty ingredients for home cooking, and showcasing store products at an on-site caf\u00e9! Menu is limited, but everything we tried was great. This is definitely a spot to make reservations, as seats are limited. Come hungry and bring a couple of friends- I wish I'd had an extra person or two with me to order the entire menu to share!\n\nJELLYFISH \"CALAMARI\" FRIES WITH SQUID INK AIOLI: The best calamari ever! Breading was light, seemed to be cornmeal based, and did not adhere so well, but this was the best-tasting calamari or jellyfish dish I've had. Bright, acidic, fresh, with that great squid ink aioli. Wanted to lick the plate. A must-order, great start to our meal.\nLIONFISH CEVICHE: It was a bit sad to order and consume this dish while staring directly at a lionfish in the tank beside us. But lionfish are the cockroaches of the ocean and they need to be eaten! (True story, Google it.) The ceviche itself was very citrusy and the flavor of the lionfish was not the star of the dish, it seemed to be overpowered by the other ingredients. But the tempura shiso leaves were the best vessel for eating this! BF said he wouldn't get this again, but I am open to other versions of lionfish.\nMADE TO ORDER CAESAR: The Worcestershire flavor is more pronounced in this version than in others I've tried. Portion is easily shareable, the egg was perfectly poached.\nMONTEAMORE GRILLED CHEESE ON BAGUETTE WITH LOCAL HONEY: This dish is where my BF finally \"got it\" about why I was so anxious to come here ASAP. This is the best grilled cheese. It's not a traditional version, but it's crisp and buttery, with a bright, salty cheese balanced well by the use of local honey and plated with house-made pickles. Portion is small like the price tag ($6), great for sharing as a starter.\nCRISPY BRICK CHICKEN THIGH: WOW. The chicken thigh itself is so tender, and served atop a wonderful savory mushroom bread pudding. I cook with chicken thigh a lot, and don't particularly care for the texture of bread pudding, so I almost didn't order this but it really was amazing. The chopped chives on top added just the right amount of verdant freshness.\nHANDCUT PAPPARDELLE PASTA: BF's entr\u00e9e choice at our server's recommendation, reminiscent of a beef stroganoff, sans beef. The pasta was thin, delicate ribbons, married with a heap of roasted mushrooms and artichokes. Great dish.\nCROISSANT FRENCH TOAST: BF's dessert pick, lots of flavors and textures going on here. Bread wasn't too thick, caramel apple cider sauce wasn't too sweet, and the fresh julienned green apples on top were a great accent. \nHEXX CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME: Simple but very good. Three slices of orange over a pot of rich chocolate mousse, with fennel pollen. I can't honestly tell you what the pollen tastes like but everything came together well- and this coming from someone who usually shies away from dishes that combine chocolate and citrus. \n\nThe new industrial location is near their former dwelling, but with increased floor space and a kitchen. Adding the caf\u00e9 concept is wonderful, and Vegas needs more spots like this that highlight local talent (both cooking and sourcing!) in a way that locals can appreciate. This is making the shortlist of places we will be bringing visiting friends and relatives.

I enjoyed the cucumber dipping sauce but this didn't pop needed a hit of acidity or something.\nPAPAYA SALAD: BF requested this and devoured the entire portion. Sauce was slightly spicy, did not like the half-frozen green beans used though.\nCRAB FRIED RICE: This was listed on the board as a daily special. Portion was large enough, and I like that the extra bit of attention and effort were put into presentation even though this was a takeout order. However, I asked for a spice level of 5 (on their 1-10 scale) and this had no spice whatsoever. I ended up dumping two cups of chili paste and some red pepper flakes into the dish to give it some heat. It's a huge pet peeve of mine to be asked for a spice level and then not even take it into account when cooking the dish. It was even on the receipt so I'm not sure who dropped the ball.\n\nLocated in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot on Sahara next door to a leather goods shop, it's not necessarily a place I'll return- the food was fine, but didn't have anything about it to stand out from the sea of other thai places on the block.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c8b7niizd3jigDlq-z_E6Q"}

I'm definitely coming back here for more sandwiches, though the selection is a bit limited . Grab the dac biet!\n\nThe namesake pho is also a good option- broth was lighter than is typical around town, and meat was an average portion but less fatty than cuts served at other shops.

Everything was fresh and priced appropriately though ($5).\n\nService was attentive and friendly- much more so than I'm used to receiving at a Vietnamese place, to be honest.

For a low $3, the piece is huge and features one of the best crusts I've ever had. I'm not even a big crust fan in general, but this was incredible. Cheesecake itself was lightly sweet and creamy, accented only by decorative whipped cream swirls and a tiny bit of chocolate.\n\nUnfortunately my second item wasn't as successful- got a Nutella cookie, which was two light cookies freshly-filled upon order with piped Nutella cream. The cookies were so delicate they fell apart, and despite a short ride home they were already soggy from the cream, which was airy and delicious. The red syrup accent was cloyingly sweet and detracted from the favorable elements of the cookie. Maybe it's one of those things that's just not for me.\n\nShop is small but very clean.

I like the cooking method and these were solid, and admirably light on grease. But the nearby CK has a larger portion with a great dipping sauce that this version can't hold a candle to.\nTODAY'S SASHIMI/TARTARE (TUNA POKE): This was just okay. Poke was oddly seasoned with large chunks of onion and a lot of spice, rather than the citrus-garlic-ponzu punch I'd been anticipating. It was really fresh though.\nLAMB TACOS: The dish I was most anticipating, with a clever concept of crafting a taco shell from fried eggplant. I really enjoyed the sweet pepper chutney, which was reminiscent of a ratatouille. But the lamb itself lacked the familiar, meaty flavor. Seemed to lack any sort of seasoning whatsoever.\nCRISPY DEVILED EGGS: A fried egg white with nicely fried crispy texture, topped with a bland but creamy egg yolk filling, and entirely too much paprika. I had anticipated a version similar to a Thai hard-boiled egg, yielding a barely-cooked yolk. This just didn't work for me. Other that the paprika, there wasn't much going on... and for $8/4 pieces, CK's version with caviar is the better option.\n\nI was dying to try their sticky toffee pudding, but my BF refused to order anything else and experience additional frustration. Around this time, our server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes and eventually the super-sweet food runner settled our bill for us. This spot has great decor and the menu all sounds like food I'd love, but the execution and/or consistency are just not there at this time- perhaps Chris and I had different chefs working on our visits?
