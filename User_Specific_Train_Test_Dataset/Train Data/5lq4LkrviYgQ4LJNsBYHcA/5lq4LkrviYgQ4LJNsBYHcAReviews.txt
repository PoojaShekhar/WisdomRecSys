Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"  While I guess she didn't define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \"I hope you will join us again.\" I will not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

Wandering up the strip we noticed a shop we'd seen closed the day prior was now open and decided to stop in to Mon Aimee Chocolat.  Greeted by owner Amy Rosenfield the moment we walked in the door I was a bit taken aback - she seemed frustrated...but her mood quickly changing as we entered the shop.  Jovial, pleasant, and ready/willing/able to discuss her collection of confections at length it turned out that her original frustration was due to a downed credit card machine and getting the runaround from the IT folks over the phone.\n\nBrowsing the shop while Amy dealt with the folks via phone we stood in awe of the diversity of the collection Aero bars from Canada, Amadei from Italy, and even Hershey from right up the road.  Vintage to current, house made to international, gums, cookies, caramels,  and...Capogiro gelato.  Already full of Pamela's fantastic breakfast we debated (briefly) whether ice cream before 10am was a good idea - a unanimous yes.  Selecting two scoops at a somewhat pricey $4.25 our choices were Cappuccino and Cioccolato Scuro (\"Bitter.\")  Having heard great things about Capogiro but not yet making it to Philadelphia all I can say is that the rumors are true - the flavors were superb, the texture like silk, and the weight light and appealing...the Scuro literally tasted like brownie batter without the doughy texture.\n\nSelecting a few creamy salted caramels, a small bag of housemade chocolate covered blueberries, and a few gifts to take home to my aunt we settled the bill and bid Amy good luck with the tech support.  A fantastic store with a selection rivaled by few I'd place Mon Aimee on the \"must visit\" list for the Strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gFT2yXDXJ1qfuGOSfSU5Bw"}

With the bar empty and only one section being seated be claimed our reservation and were led quickly to a table near the large glass windows - an excellent view of the river would be our companion throughout the meal.  Meeting our waiter, a friendly man named Chendo we were given menus and a brief explanation of the daily special pastas for the Pasta Trio.  With the restaurant quite slow that day I will note we were very well taken care of throughout out meal - the service staff was excellent.\n\nBrowsing the high ceilinged room, randomly placed bottles and objects, and abundant brightly colored glass panels plus Chihuily influenced chandeliers I have to say Lidia's is a very handsome restaurant - it has that \"wow\" factor of many New York City dining rooms.  While the white paper over white tablecloth aspect of the table setting struck me as odd, everything else felt \"fine dining\" without seeming forced.\n\nSitting and waiting for our meals to arrive we were first delivered one of the better bread baskets I've had in recent memory - Sea Salt Foccacia, Rustic Italian, and Cracked Wheat Sourdough served with two spreads, a Chick Pea Pesto and pureed White Beans with Black Olive, both resting in a pool of slightly sweet extra virgin olive oil.  Served warm the breads were tantalizing and given the size of the portions soon to be arriving it was definitely a chore not to overindulge (a chore I failed, miserably.)\n\nFor our main courses my mother opted for a salad and a contorti while Erika and I chose pastas.  For myselfthe choice was quite simple - my favorite pasta and my favorite protein on the same plate, Gnocchi with Duck Guazetto.  An Italian Stew not unlike Chicken Cacciatore, but featuring duck in white wine instead of Chicken in Red the thick reduction was hearty, meaty, smoky, and laden with vegetables.  Paired with a toothsome yet non-doughy potato gnocchi the dish was not only enormous, but incredibly filling.  While I will admit I ate a lot of bread and helped my mother and sister  with their plates I can say that this was one dish I couldn't finish, it was just too large.\n\nFor Mother's selection she opted for the Roasted Beet and Apple Salad with Frisee and Fresh Goat Cheese plus the Pan Seared Golden Polenta Fritters.  A competent salad with sweet apples balancing earthy beets and pungent goat cheese the dish was brought together by a splash of balsamic and olive oil, ample in size and flavor, very nicely done.  Not fairing quite as well as the Salad were the Fritters - nicely prepared and crispy on the outside with creamy polenta within, they simply lacked flavor.\n\nErika's selection would be the signature Pasta Trio - three pastas plated tableside with unlimited refills.  Admittedly the concept sounds somewhat \"Olive Garden\" but that is before you realize two of the pastas are made in house and one is imported direct from Italy...and all the sauces are made daily in the kitchen, as well.  Served up onto a single large platter the daily selections  would be hand torn Tagliatelle and Pork Ragu, Imported Orchiette with Fennel Sausage and Thyme, and house folded Sweet Pea and Corn Ravioli with Cream Sauce.  Enormous in portion I cannot really fathom anyone requiring seconds of the trio and at a mere $14 the selections were excellent.  Smoky and Sweet the Pork Ragu complimented the al dente Tagliatelle nicely while the aromatic sausage was an equally balanced flavor for the Orchiette.  The most impressive of the group, the sweet pea and corn ravioli, was sweetened only by the vegetal components while the cream itself had notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nArriving simultaneously and thankfully smaller than the entrees was Torta di Mandorle e Mirtilli - Blueberry and almond cake, blueberry-lavender ice cream, almond crunch, blueberries. .  If a little is good a lot is better seemed to be the theme of this dessert and it worked nicely - the fresh blueberries lacing the buttery pound cake, the flowery accent to the blueberry ice cream, and the crunchy sugared almonds paired with even more blueberries - excellent.\n\nThe second dessert, larger in size but lighter in texture, would be Panna Cotta alla Fragola - Strawberry and ricotta panna cottas, lemon-strawberry sandwich cookies, fresh strawberries.  Served in a 12oz glass better suited for a milkshake the panna cotta was surprisingly springy and well blended with a more gelatin strawberry base topped by an ample creamy layer of whipped cream and ricotta.  Unnecessary but welcomed the lemony cookies were much akin to a shortbread in texture and Madeline in flavor.\n\nHaving heard \"upscale Olive Garden\" comparisons I personally find that assessment far from accurate and would actually go so far as to say that aside from the lack of seasoning the the experience was on par with many fine dining Italian establishments in other cities.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

Discussing amongst ourselves while scouring other tables for evidence of portion size we eventually settled on one appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza...we then began the agonizing process of deciding which option sounded best.  \n\nBaked in house the first basket was had only three options while the second arrived with a fourth.  With each bread a great example of its particular type the baskets featured a smoky Rustic Italian, buttery Semolina Vienna, amply sour sesame seed crusted Sourdough, and a buttery moist Foccacia.  While I rather wish the pairing would have been a nice olive oil as opposed to butter neither were really necessary with all the sauce that required mopping up.\n\nBeginning the meal as the sounds of eager diners bounced around the wonderfully decorated brick and tile interior was a delightful Arancini with creamy arborio rice providing a slightly toothsome contrast to velvety fried Mozzarella.   An ample portion for a mere $6 the dish was only enhanced by resting the crispy balls of cheese in a pool of house-made marinara.  Remember the comment about the bread - a whole basket was used to dredge the plate clean of the aromatic and slightly acidic sauce.\n\nSelecting two of the eighteen pastas the pair was delivered simultaneously and looking back I still cannot decide which was better.  Beginning first with the Paglia E Fieno, a spinach and egg tagliatelle with peas, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and cream I was stunned by the bouncy texture of the pasta to tooth yet its undeniable melt-in-the-mouth texture upon mastication...al dente done just right.  Complimenting the pasta were sweet and snappy peas, a smooth and salty prosciutto, and a pungent parmigiano-reggiano that added texture and pungency.  All balanced by a somewhat sweet cream sauce the entire dish was well thought out, well balanced, and divine.\n\nNot to be outdone, Gnocchi Di Ricotta featuring Ricotta Gnocchi, Butter, Sage, and Parmigiana-Reggiano was a dish that would have the three of us fighting for the last dumpling.  Simply prepared, as one expects from a rustic dish like gnocchi, the dumplings were undoubtedly the star of the dish-literally melting puddles of potato and ricotta cheese that provided little resistance to tooth, yet enough body to support and absorb the subtly sweet and aromatic sauce.  Topped with a quick grating of cheese and cracked black pepper the gnocchi was one of the best I've ever tasted-a skilled hand, perfect cooking conditions, and largely un-fussed-with.\n\nEnjoying all the previous efforts so much the \"star\" of the afternoon was nearly an afterthought-and one heck of an afterthought given that it is where the restaurant made its name.  Opting for the Provola with Smoked Mozzarella di bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Baby Arugula, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil we watched as the dough emerged from the temperature controlled room, was rolled by hand, topped and was placed inside the stone oven for a mere 90 seconds.  Emerging bubbly and charred the pizza was topped with a heap of fresh arugala, drizzled with olive oil and a quick shredding of Parmigiano-Reggiano before being plated and brought to the table.  Squeaky and smoky the cheese was a perfect foil for the cornmeal accented and yeasty dough.  Crisp and toasted around the circumference of the 13 inche pie and sopping wet at the center each ingredient was pronounced in flavor with the super sweet tomatoes and basil forming the foundation and the bite of the parmigiano and bitterness of the Arugula providing a nice compliment of flavor.\n\nArriving quickly and in ample portion the house made desserts were both presented simply and unadorned.  Beginning first with the Tiramisu-a rather standard example with buttery lady fingers, smooth mascarpone, high quality cocoa, ribbons of chocolate, and a hefty shot of rum-it was good, but like many pre-prepared versions it was largely unbalanced with the rum soaking the bottom layer and cream dominating the top.  Significantly more impressive was the Cannoli, a crisp and slightly cinnamon accented shell housing a lightly lemon tinged ricotta cream.  One end dipped in crushed pistachio, the other in chocolate chips, and sitting atop a bed of hand whipped cream-light, refreshing, and authentic.\n\nGreat service, everything expertly prepared, and prices that fit the quality of the ingredients I was very happy with every aspect of our meal.  Honestly, when the pizza, one of the best I've ever had was the \"worst\" savory...that is saying something.  Clearly I need to start paying attention to that Verace Pizza Napoletana Association list when I travel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

Driving though the streets of Pittsburgh up to Walnut Street the GPS alerted us that a programmed destination was close and our plans changed - Prantl's would be dessert, instead.  Ever intrigued by restaurants, shops, bakeries, and cafes that become infamous for a single item (see Haydel's in NOLA or Patisserie Claude in NYC) I felt it necessary to see if the Burnt Almond Torte lived up to the hype.\n\nParking at a Premium at this time of day I hopped out while the others circled the block.  Entering the small shop and finding no less than 7 people waiting in line I grabbed a number and browsed the selections - 5 full cases ranging from whole cakes to single iced cookies and everything in between.  With 5 servers behind the counter the line moved quickly and it would be a matter of minutes before I had to make a decision - opting for three items that spanned a wide range I paid the modest $6 tab and made my way outside.\n\nOpening the string-tied box the smell of cinnamon quickly filled the air announcing to everyone my first selection - a still-slightly-warm Cinnamon roll.  Ample, yeasty, and loaded with butter and Cinnamon I quite liked that the pastry was not overly-iced, instead focusing on the more nuanced flavors and natural yeasty flavor of the roll.  While my sister contested it would have been better hot (I can't say I disagree) it was an excellent pasty none the less.\n\nThe second selection was ordered more out of tradition than out of necessity - a chocolate cupcake with colorful sugary frosting.  Having not yet indulged on a cupcake in our Pittsburgh trip I can't say this option looked particularly interesting, but tradition is tradition and surprisingly it was actually quite good.  Simple white on black cake, moist and sweet - nothing new, but certainly an adequate cupcake for $0.99.\n\nThe final choice was obviously the Burnt Almond Torte - a single \"Bar\" for $3.25.  Large and heavy I was expecting to have my mind blown given the reviews all I can say is that the rumors are true.  Somewhat Twinkie, somewhat Pound Cake, smooth and complex custard plus whipping cream, and sugar laden almonds cooked to just short of scorched.  Crispy, creamy, crispy, creamy - layer upon layer of home style decadence.  Sharing the bar around the car (and making a mess) everyone agreed that this was one of the best baked goods we'd ever experienced - and an absolute bargain at that.  Really, much like King Cake in NOLA and Pizza in Chicago  I can't imagine going back to Pittsburgh and not getting a slice of Burnt Almond Torte from Prantl's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yWVY1Bq19lDxu3BP7_96EQ"}

Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.\n\nArriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take \"any seat I wanted\" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.\n\nHaving debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive \"Grandma Slice\" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.\n\nMoving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was \"wow - that is a lot of cheese\" while my second, after a bite, was \"wow - that is a lot of flavor.\"  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.\n\nLargely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ"}

Beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, caf\u00e9, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is La Grande Orange Grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to \"fit.\"\n\nHarbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go I made my way into La Grande Orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing I could think of when I entered the door was a trip to Whole Foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  With cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once I entered and started to browse I detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.  \n\nHaving already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at Bianco for later in the day I took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  With many items baked in house and others provided by Tammie Coe Bakery two doors down I weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable I ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as \"the best thing in the world;\" a promise I told her I'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab I made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as I checked into my hotel.)\n\nBeginning first with my selection, La Grande Orange's very own Red Velvet Cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better Red Velvets I've had in some time save for the stellar version at Bouchon Bakery just one month prior.  Loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what I'm pretty sure was clove I really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.\n\nMoving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the Tammie Coe Crumb Bun, I really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what I received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet I had on my visit to Arizona.  Beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous Breton Kouign Amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  Layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all I can say is that if you find yourself in the Phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections I was lucky to be staying so far from La Grande Orange and Tammie Coe because otherwise I'd have gone back for more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g"}

Sure there have been other restaurants that have stirred such emotions but for whatever reason - generally distance or a desire to try something new - I have not yet had the opportunity.  With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.\n\nDescribed simply as \"an organic coffee and breakfast bar, caf\u00e9, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery\" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Caf\u00e9 (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.\n\nEthiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.\n\nCroque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'\n\nFamous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and cr\u00e8me fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's \"French Pancakes\" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'\n\nBlueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.\n\nPumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.\n\n...more to come", "type": "review", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g"}

A bag of these and a jar of local honey, preserves, or pretty much any topping sold at LGO Grocery would make for a lovely start to Sunday breakfast at home.\n\nBlackberry Almond Dumpling:  If this is available at LGO you should do yourself a favor and buy two.  Powder sugar dusted and crispy like a croissant on its exterior with a wispy pull-apart interior somewhere between the aforementioned croissant and a cinnamon roll this 'dumpling' was rife with frangipane and fresh blackberries, but more so with butter.  Served warm and well-endowed to make a substantial mess of clothing both black and white I would recommend this one only as a fork and knife pastry, though any mess you make will be worth it.\n\nPistachio Chocolate Cream Puff:  A cream puff per LGO but a dressed up Paris Brest to me this wheel of choux was perhaps not as texturally sound or traditional as some of the hazelnut versions of France and elsewhere but with crackling pastry topped with a cocoa shell and crunchy pistachios plus an interior of pistachio tinged pastry cream it would be hard to be disappointed by this one.  Every bit as unique as Dominique Ansel's Paris/NY but not quite as decadent I personally loved the sweet meets savory aspects of this one but would definitely go early as the shell was starting to get a bit moist by the time I enjoyed this around noon.\n\nCr\u00e8me Fraiche Coffee Cake:  I'll totally admit to being a sucker for coffee cake, and even more for butter cake - but prior to entering La Grande Orange that Saturday morning I had no idea there was cr\u00e8me fraiche cake.  With the traditional style obviously focused on sour cream, or in the rare case cream cheese, this take would up the ante in the savories department and with sours nicely balanced by cinnamon and what I swear was cardamom and maybe even rosemary I could have eaten a whole loaf of this if LGO had provided me jam.  With a fine crumb and delicately sweet this went great with coffee but I could see it equally well suited alongside afternoon tea and sandwiches or cheese.\n\nOld Timer Cupcake:  Having already enjoyed the Red Velvet cupcake on a prior visit (as well as the Red Velvet Cake from LGO at Chelsea's Kitchen earlier that day) I decided to try the Old Timer on my most recent visit to LGO and while I'm not sure if you can call it a cupcake since it is covered top to bottom with a crunchy dark chocolate shell and therefore more like a Ding Dong (or King Don for you Midwesterners) it is still quite delicious as the dark chocolate shell, airy chocolate angel food cake, and light cream all come together much like the classic Hostess version, but with a bit less of the artificial sweetness.  Great with a cup of coffee there is really nothing 'special' here, just a really good piece of chocolate cake that goes nicely with a cup of coffee (or a big glass of milk.)\n\nAtoZ Cookie and French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie:  Two more things that go great with milk or coffee, these half pound cookies are without a doubt amongst the best I've ever tasted.  Two choices amongst a daily half-dozen or so each of these decadent creations sets a high standard for texture with the outer rim slightly crisp while the interior falls just short of 'set' but where they truly excel are the ingredients - the former a sort of kitchen sink concoction of corn flakes, caramel, oats, toffee, and who knows what else while the second is simply a perfect dark chocolate chunk cookie heavily garnished with a hefty shake of fresh flaked fleur de sel.  Go early when they're warm - and before they sell out.\n\nCampfire Smores Brownie:  In a word, decadent and in another, intense; for the chocolate lover this is an absolute must (but even then it is probably best shared.)  Dense, moist, and rife with dark chocolate while house made marshmallows and graham crackers attempt to add some levity this certainly isn't an everyday treat but as a capper to a an LGO pizza it worked quite nicely.", "type": "review", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g"}

Would it be easiest to discuss it as a \"resort restaurant\" where the meal is begun with an offering of citrus selections for the water and silverware is presented temperature appropriate?  Would it make sense to talk about the culinary pedigree of head Chef Michael O'Dowd and his heavy reliance on refined French technique to display the beauty of rarely utilized locally farmed ingredients?  Or perhaps I should start off in the manner that a meal at Kai begins - with a lengthy and informative story about the location, tribe, and inspirations of the meal that will follow.  In reality I think any of the above would be appropriate, but in the end I think the best way to begin is in the mindset of a \"destination\" meal because from start to finish that is precisely what Kai is.\n\nThe second course of my meal at Kai would prove to be the single best thing I ate during my visit to the desert - a plate where nearly everything screamed \"heavy and overly complicated\" but a dish where each element added something to the whole with the resultant product even greater than the sum of its parts.  Entitled \"Escargot, Truffles, Wild Mushrooms & Caramel Goat Cheese\" this lovely presentation arrived with a piece of slightly sweetened Native \"French Toast\" at one end and a stew of Burgundy snails, Oregon truffles, and pork belly nuggets at the other.  Teaming with notes of Meyer lemon and black garlic nage plus the sweet acidity of blis vinegar the dish was finally topped tableside with a slowly melting frozen Truffle Crema and dots of Tarragon Oil and Chive Oil that added an aromatic tinge both earthy and herbal that rose to the palate and sinuses melding all the flavors into a truly magnificent dish.\n\nAnother highlight reel dish and served at the size of its full a la carte portion the \"Prairie Squab & Spiced Cornmeal Dusted Sweetbreads\" would be quite the generous offering.  Beginning first with the scarlet squab featuring a flawless sear and the hockey-puck sized sweetbread, crispy on the outside and creamy within, both of the proteins on this plate would prove exemplary.  Moving next to the accoutrements - beneath the squab a round of truffled Iberico Lomo Gratinee Potatoes plus Wilted Summer Chard Leaves and under the thymus a dollop of stone fruit & grape Chutney with Truffle Croutons -one sweet and one savory once again, and both complimentary to their respective proteins without being overwhelming.\n\nmMy final dessert would arrive in the hands of a back-server along with a warning of \"be careful, this is very hot\" and indeed it was, the Mexican Chocolate Souffle's ramekin radiating a palpable heat at easily a two foot distance.  Large, tall, proper, and aromatic with notes of cocoa and \"Kai's Sweetened Dry Mole Spices\" the souffl\u00e9 was subsequently punctured tableside with the addition of a thick and smoky Wattleseed Anglaise and without hesitation I can say that although non-traditional in texture the flavor was outstanding...a sweet meets savory brownie with notes of cinnamon, cumin, pepper, and clove punctuating the chocolate and melding with the Anglaise.  Like the cheesecake this is the sort of dessert I imagined when I requested its addition to my menu and I'd encourage any and all to do the same.\n\nNo stranger to fine dining whether stateside or in Paris I will simply state that although some may not appreciate \"resort\" restaurants or the somewhat longwinded ostentatiousness of Kai's presentations there is not a doubt in my mind that this is a restaurant deserving of its 5-star accolades and the sort of restaurant that would invariably garner at least two if not three Michelin Stars if the Red Guide ever came to town.  A refined experience with an exquisitely talented chef preparing ingredients both common and unique in ways that are novel even to the experience diner Kai is not just a restaurant, but truly the exploration of native and local flavors that it sets out to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T9iBSa4pxYXP129pHlt5Sg"}

Showered and refreshed by the in-room Starbucks Africa Kitamu and readied for another long day of eating, sightseeing, eating, hockey, and eating I made my way to the car and set my GPS for the town of Gilbert; destination Liberty Market, home of what many (including the local paper) have noted to be the best Bread Pudding around.\n\nA functioning grocery since 1935 and located in a building under a water tower every bit showing its age I approached Liberty Market slowly due to the local farmer's market - a market containing much of what has now been out of season in Ohio for at least a month - and with parking readily available I made my way into Liberty Market via the side door.  Passing the al fresco dining area, the kitchen, and subsequently the store and pastry counter to take my place in a line six deep I grabbed a paper menu on the way in to browse though in all reality it was not really necessary; I knew what I was there for and the pastry case had already tempted me with any number of appetizers.  \n\nStanding in line while others made their decisions, some a full meal and some merely pastries to go, when I eventually reached the coffee bar I was greeted by a young man with spacers and sleeves to fit his blas\u00e9 demeanor and placing my order the price was recited and a number was handed to me with any number of seats to choose from both inside and out.  Opting this time for the indoors and filling a glass with water and ice I took a seat with a full view of the room and placing my number on the table was left to wait for perhaps 10 minutes while reading a local guidebook detailing Liberty's history as well as  the other restaurants in Joe Johnston's stable.\n\nSipping my water while watching a small boy barely make a dent in his enormous pile of eggs my first course of the meal at Liberty would arrive hot from the pastry case in the form of the largest Cinnamon Roll I've eaten to date - a squared off yeasty pastry nearly filling the 12\" by 12\"plate and inundating what I can only imagine to be a 6 foot diameter with the smells of butter, cinnamon, and sugar.  Large yet impressively light with wispy dough sandwiching layers of cinnamon and butter and the entirely lacquered in a thin sugar shell the Cinnamon Roll wowed in flavor as much as it did in size and without being the belly buster of Cinnabon was a perfect size to share as an appetizer - or, if you're feeling truly ravenous (gluttonous) to enjoy on your own.\n\nWith the cinnamon roll easily dispatched of and now wishing I'd have gotten coffee but not wanting to withstand the 10+ deep line my second dish would arrive approximately fifteen minutes on the heels of the cinnamon roll and given all its hype I truly expected the Griddled Bread Pudding to be mind blowing, but alas it was merely very good.  Served with real maple syrup and approximately half the size and twice the weight of the cinnamon roll the bread pudding was in reality nearly flawless French Toast - a caramelized exterior and a moist custard interior, but what he had in texture it unfortunately lacked in taste.  Largely eggy but also with slight notes of cinnamon and vanilla that perked up with the syrup perhaps part of my disillusionment with the pudding was actually how sweet its predecessor had been but overall it just felt like something was missing - perhaps some fruit, whipped cream, or caramelized nuts to add a bit of texture and nuance (this is apparently how they serve the dessert, non-griddled, bread pudding.)\n\nOverall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes, plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

Admitting up front that I'm neither Jewish nor particularly fond of smoked fish and thus leaving judgments of authenticity or the quality of their Lox at the door, it was just short of 8:15am when I entered the deceptively large space and with a young Hispanic gentleman shouting 'sit anywhere you want' I did just that, a quick perusal of the deli and bakery confirming some selections for later before sitting down to a menu already in place.

Situated on Decatur and the largest of a handful of locations spanning the city the look and feel of the restaurant can best be summed up as an upscaled Denny's with better coffee alongside a more creative menu and given my early hour of arrival the service was exemplary - an older couple entering just after me the restaurant's only other patrons.  A skeleton crew in the kitchen largely focused on preparing the day's housemade cakes and pastries it was with little delay that decisions were made from the extensive menu and orders placed I chatted with my waitress at length, the longtime veteran of Blueberry Hill keeping coffee filled to the brim and commending my picks while offering suggestions for 'next time' - an occurrence that will be sooner rather than later given the quality of what soon arrived.  Beginning savory and moving to sweet it was with a loaded un-fried Monte Cristo that I began and deferring standard jam with a request for the housemade strawberry compote I'd strongly recommend everyone do the same as the ample sweetness proved a lovely balance to briny ham and smoked turkey...\"balance\" completely ignored by my second selection, the pillow soft pancakes chock-a-block full of crushed cookies and smeared with frosting identical in flavor to the cream-filling, plus whipped cream for garnish.  Sated and heavily caffeinated it was perhaps a bit gluttonous to consider dessert but unable to pass on a rotating cake-case it was with a slice of Red Velvet that I made my departure and waiting until the afternoon to indulge the results were good, if not great, as the cake was moist and rich though I'd have preferred more tang to the icing...a small quibble at $3 for the 11.6oz 'slice.'", "type": "review", "business_id": "SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ"}

Amongst other disappointments I personally found Sunrise's Bavarian cloyingly sweet and decidedly artificial tasting compared to both Real and Donut Hut, but again finding redemption it was Sunrise's Buttermilk Bar that proved my favorite item of the tasting, the archetype version loaded with tangy notes beneath sweet glaze and an ethereal texture with obvious visual separation of the cake layer and buttermilk layer on hemisection, a sort of fried coffee cake that makes me want to go back for more of their cake selections...no matter how bad the fritter.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VI9fDfMAbeFVeeUav39Tiw"}

Traditional in texture, full bodied with flavor, unmistakably custard given a light egginess to the vanilla, and with substantially more heft than the versions popularized at iconic Ted Drewes' or franchised Rita's it took a few rich spoonfuls to truly appreciate the velvety texture of the custard itself as I worked through toppings acting more as a distraction than a compliment but once down to creamy base it can only be said that this is indeed some excellent custard and for fans of the style it is a 'must visit,' though for my dining dollars the presence of Art of Flavors only a few blocks away will make a return unlikely anytime soon as even the \"best\" custard can't hold a candle to truly superlative gelato.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uYVdp5LfCbX8S8ytnhdk-g"}

Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at the sizeable storefront and although the clock had just ticked past 7:15am I entered the restaurant to find the place already lively, a quartet of tables already seated while two couples before me checked in with a friendly hostess soon leading them to their seats.  Eventually finding my place at a booth best suited for four it was mere seconds before my server stopped by and with my order pre-decided based on past experience a simple request that plates arrive in two courses was granted, the long cooking time of the later assuring a fifteen minute delay between rounds.  Sipping on water as the restaurant continued to fill it would not be long before first plates arrived and although the restaurant's eponymous buttermilk batter was fluffy as ever beneath a mountain of whipped cream it was the house-baked challah that truly impressed, the exterior rendered crispy while the center was soaked in sweet custard playing counterpoint the rich egginess of soft bread.

Clearly a menu designed with wine in mind but not particularly wanting to imbibe so early in the day it was instead the food that brought me to Bacchus, specifically the house charcuterie program and as such selecting the Bacchus platter along with an order of the house foie gras would be the order of the day, a lovely arrangement that paired beautifully with not only the warm house bread but also the weather, sun, water, ducks and turtles passing by.  From appropriately funky rillettes to spicy chorizo and a hearty pork pate each item on the charcuterie platter was excellent while the foie gras itself was delicate and creamy with all its characteristic sapor despite the surprisingly flavorless and liquidy gelee - a situation remedied quickly with a request for more quince.  Moving on to dessert, and actually a difficult choice amongst a pair of my favorites I eventually went with my instincts and selected the bread pudding, a delicate cloud that seemed to be made of angel food cake with ample house whipped cream and a sidecar of intense rum sauce spiked with cinnamon.

Undoubtedly a spot where 'regulars' are expected while newcomers are welcomed with open arms it was just after 11am when my friend and I entered the Argentinean barbeque doubling as bakery, deli, as well as gourmet market and quickly seated beneath an LCD television displaying futbol while the rest of Las Vegas buzzed about the American collegiate variety it was as though we'd instantly been transported many miles away, our smiling server just efficient enough in English to guide our hand to a baker's dozen of options served alongside toasty bread and herbal chimichurri that eschewed heat in favor of earthy notes and smoothness that complimented everything on which it was poured.  Beginning first with a trio of empanadas that featured flaky puff pastry around intensely spiced chicken, cheddar studded in pork, and shucked corn with sweetness tempered by onions and cream one would be hard pressed to choose a winner amongst the group and turning next to the Italian Provoletta a similar theme emerged, the texture intensely creamy while diverse aromatics and just a hint of spice tickled the palate with each balanced bite.  Unable to ignore the tabletop barbeque, presented still sizzling with pre-set options or choices a la carte, it was after perhaps thirty minutes that our enormous entr\u00e9e arrived and featuring more than enough for a family of four to share we each sampled widely, the blood sausage particularly noteworthy for myself with a spice profile and texture on par with artisan sausages I've paid double for elsewhere while the tender sweetbreads were also beyond reproach.  Transitioning to dessert I was fortunate to be dining with a friend who was more than willing to take the overindulgent approach and although I'm rather certain I consumed the majority of what was ordered there is no doubt that we were both invariably impressed by everything that arrived - the milky flan smooth yet rich while both the Milhojas and Alfajor presented a more restrained sweetness and textural juxtapositions of cream amidst crunch, a slice of quince pie rounding out the quartet with the fruit's intense sweetness finding its foil in a buttery golden crust.\n\nEvery bit as good as the rumors, and the very definition of 'hidden in plain sight,' Rincon de Buenos Aires is the sort of place anyone looking for something 'new' or 'different' should investigate, the prices trending a bit higher than much of Spring Mountain but quality of product, preparation, and service far outperforming most of them as well.  To the best of my knowledge the only Argentine barbeque in Las Vegas and one of the few places where blood sausage and sweetbreads can be bought by the pound even vegetarians will be safe here as the restaurant offers a number of unique pastas, pizzas, and produce driven options...not to mention prepackaged goods, ready-to-bake empanadas, and desserts that are well worth the effort even if you decide to take them home for later and skip the sizzling meats.", "type": "review", "business_id": "O1NBNVfXWmk3CvszAhOEoQ"}

Starting at the door where hasty greetings lead us to the back room it would be less that thirty seconds after seating that the blitzkrieg began - baskets and steamers that had clearly been propped against the wall shoved in our faces with several selections requiring an unannounced trip to the kitchen microwave - and kicking off with a trio of steamed options it was only BBQ Pork buns that proved competent as rubbery XLB and Shu Mai skins undermined otherwise juicy contents.  Still frenetic in pace as a $16 lobster special with slippery noodles swimming in ginger found its way to the table alongside a trio of excellent baked pastries it would unfortunately not be long before these gems were lost amidst overly salted garlic smelt and a dry coconut sponge, the duo immediately leaving me parched  as beverage refills lagged.

Pinckney Street, a table set for one at the restaurant's center mine for the night.  Toqued by Chef Tory Miller and similarly focused on locally sourced proteins and produce as the space next door it was once more that I found myself seated amidst floor-to-ceiling windows but with the capitol now illuminated and tables clad in white linen the mood was decidedly different, the majority of other diners clearly celebrating special events as any number of candle-lit desserts emerged from the kitchen throughout the night.  Offered in two formats, prix fixe or tasting, it was without hesitation that I opted to enjoy L'Etoile's signature experience and although service was a bit off-kilter as my captain often interrupted me to repeat descriptions of plates already well presented it was without a single flaw in execution that each plate arrived, the flavorless house-bread and ice-cubes of butter a lone exception to the rule.  Starting off with the first of two elegant mocktails as a canap\u00e9 and an amuse whetted the palate it was after a bit of delay that my first course arrived but with the thinly sliced scallops finding even more sweetness in late season corn atop an anchor of mushrooms and bright tomatoes one could hardly complain, a textbook terrine of foie gras melting into a sweet, rich soup quick to follow on its heels.  With another short stoppage between plates it was onward to flaky sablefish with crispy skin atop earthy mushroom puree that the meal progressed and rounding out savories with a rosy strip of duck amidst pleasant aromatics followed by a thick cut of lamb atop early winter beans cooked to a cream-like consistency not one of the five plates would prove anything short of stellar, a thin wedge of cheese no less impressive when plated against crispy potatoes and aromatic onions tempered by house-made jam.  Admittedly coveting several of the desserts listed in the prix fixe and almost requesting a supplemental course (or three) it was mostly with a mind on the late hour and another full day to come that I showed some restraint and with two brioche beignets arriving alongside no less than four presentations of peach I perfectly satisfied, the trio of mignardises a final send-off with the fruit-filled truffle stealing the show from fresh popped corn lacquered in caramel that was also quite good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oGE8GPmBvHXQskP-m2cdLw"}

Every bit a mom n' pop spot and the sort of place that looks as though it has \"been there fooorrrrrever\" to feed little Badgers and alumni alike it was first with a startle and then a smile that my server eventually came around the corner and much to my delight it was almost as if he was baring gifts, a full tray of Frisbee-sized fritters glistening beneath wet glaze and still hot to the touch.  Quick to procure one $5 fritter and adding on two more $1 rings plus a Wisconsin-staple \"Kringle\" before paying my thanks and the tab it was immediately to the sunny street that I progressed and with my hotel mere moments away it was just as glaze had set that I dug in, the crispy rim of cinnamon and sugar shattering to pockets of apple amidst lightly fried dough.  Truly a textbook fritter without even a hint of oiliness it was likely an effect of such a stellar opening volley that made both the blueberry cake and old fashioned seem rather pedestrian by comparison but with textures and flavor far superior to Milwaukee's Holey Moley at nearly half the price one would still be hard pressed to complain - my only regret being the valuable stomach space filled, thus limiting my indulgence in the almond stuffed kringle whose buttery layers of lamination roused memories of a Mardi Gras King Cake without one ounce of guilt for eating it \"out of season.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "CmCvsKSVNJwtiGggMw9Khw"}

Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's \"famous\" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.\n\nMoving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.  Featuing a double dipped and friend boneless, skinless breast alongside a bowl of intense and peppery sausage gravy the chicken here was definitely the star of the show with each bite juicy and full of crunch but largely devoid of any oil whatsoever.  Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.\n\nMaking short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say \"nice job\" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife \"that boy can eat\" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.\n\nBeginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.\n\nRealizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved \"Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake\" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K8pM6qQdYu5h6buRE1-_sw"}

With some orders having been phoned in and others being delivered to the tables surrounding mine if I had to guess nearly fifteen Fry Breads were served during my nine minute wait and when I finally heard \"Michael\" called from the front I stepped up to collect my $12 merely seconds before the next order was served up to \"Andre.\"\n\nReturning to my seat with prizes in hand my first impression was that I'd over ordered as each disc was easily the size of a Frisbee and two-to-three fold as thick, but picking up my first option, the \"Indian Taco with Pinto Beans, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce\" I was next impressed as to just how light the hand stretched bread was - a wisp of pillowy flat bread crisped on the outside by the oil but light and airy within.  With the ingredients a standard store-bought admixture of traditional taco toppings and a bit of hot sauce to taste this was a good choice to understand what the \"Indian Taco\" was all about (and perhaps to understand why diabetes and lipid disorders are so prevalent in their population, as well.)\n\nMoving next to my dessert selection, one of the frequently noted \"best dishes\" in Phoenix and denoted as an \"Award Winning Favorite\" on the restaurant menu, the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the \"Fair Food\" extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon.  Sliced and resting atop both wax paper and napkins to soak up the grease I attacked this fry bread with zeal and without going so far as to call it the most sinful thing I've eaten this year I will simply say this; it was a once-in-a-year sort of treat that was entirely worth the money, calories, and visit but at the same time the sort of thing that simply feels \"bad\" for you despite the smile on your face as you're eating it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mqQwChPNN4o4DhAzaGntIA"}

Featuring clean lines and an upscale design with light music playing overhead along with service far more pleasant than other hip breakfast joints in the neighborhood, in our case from a young man named Andrew,  the restaurant plays all the right notes of similar places in other big cities and one ups the competition with a menu that is familiar but also happy to take some chances.\n\nBeginning first with beverages and baked goods while our primary plates were readied a wide variety of coffees and espresso drinks were prepared and (in the case of the coffee) refilled copiously while the signature Hot Cocoa was rich and thick - almost a drinking chocolate as much as a cocoa and rich enough that my aunt couldn't finish it on her own.  Speaking to the baked goods, while the banana bread could have stood for a few less minutes in the oven the pumpkin spice muffin was dense and moist, hovering somewhere between pumpkin pie and pudding cake as opposed to a muffin or quick bread.\n\nMoving on to the plates - in our case two orders of pancakes and one of French Toast - it is difficult to say which dish was the best of the group as all three were excellent, but given my predilection for custard French toast as opposed to more bready versions like that at Orange Table I'd have to lean towards the pancakes, no matter how impressive that whisky sauce was, and with that in mind I'll simply say that unless you are really sensitive to spice the Jalapeno Pecan Cakes are a signature dish worthy of signature status; the cakes toothsome and light with the flavors intense enough to make you sweat but not so hot as to make it unpleasant - particularly when balanced out with the buttery nuts and a side of tender griddled prosciutto.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V6BYjHM9SnXscfkln3hCdA"}

Chuckling to myself as I opened the menu with quotations ranging from Spaceballs to The Addams family it would be mere moments before our server, John, would stop by to fill our water and announce the daily specials.  With the afternoon crowd clearly slow and John, a good waiter but a bit more corny than would have been preferred, ever present it would be mere moments before we were ready to order and confirming all our choices as \"excellent\" we were left to chat\n\nDiscussing real estate, travel, and the area of Old-town Scottsdale it would be a mere 15 minutes before our first courses would arrive and for my appetizer I selected Duck Confit Relleno with roasted shallots, queso Oaxaca, cheddar, and roasted guajillo-tomatillo salsa, I will fully admit that I ordered this dish largely based on the fowl but what I received turned out to be large, bold, and unexpectedly quite sweet.  Beginning first with the Relleno itself, a cored pasilla chili pepper absolutely stuffed with confit and cheese then fried and coated with even more cheese the flavor was exemplary.  With fresh sliced avocado and the squeaky cheese taming the pepper while the crisp duck nicely juxtaposed the creamy cheddar it was the green salsa that really served as the most surprising part of this dish - an acidic pineapple flavor with a slightly heated finish.\n\nFor ours second course we'd see Cowboy Ciao's most famous dishes - first the \"Stetson Chopped,\" I had the opportunity to watch the beautifully arranged salad of couscous, arugula, tomato, cheese, pepitas, corn, salmon, and currants come together before my eyes.  Never one to be wowed by a salad, particularly one with a mayo based dressing I will admit that the presentation and composition of this dish did intrigue me enough to take a couple of bites and while indeed a salad I could just as easily make at home I really did love the variety of textures and flavors hiding beneath a dressing that although hefty was quite refreshing with notes of basil, onion, garlic, and lemon beneath the slightly sour creamy tones.\n\nIf the Stetson is not Cowboy Ciao's most fabled item then my main course most certainly was, a dish described simply as the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Again topped with chopped avocados, cheese, and tomatoes and consisting of \"mucho mushrooms (including cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel, yellow foot)\" in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta the pan fry would prove to be many things, not the least of which being the richest vegetarian dish I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the mushrooms - a blend I have a hard time calling exotic as each can be found at your local Whole Foods - I will admit that the variety of flavors and textures were truly impressive, particularly as they related to the hearty and complex sauce.  With each bite a different experience depending on the balance of mushrooms and vegetables this was exactly the sort of dish I love though I really could have done without the polenta - a thick gob that was so wet it did nothing to soak up any of the sauce and as such tasted like a wet sponge in the middle of the dish.\n\nHaving requested some bread to assist in sopping up the rest of the ancho cream (bread that is 'baked to order,' largely flavorless on its own, and an unlisted $2 for three meager rolls) John would arrive as my friend was finishing his salad and I was sopping up the last of my sauce to ask if we would be interested in dessert and with my love of bread pudding well documented I selected \"Bread Pudding Overboard\" which arrived on a large plate in a relatively modest portion. .  Beginning first with buttery brioche - the sort they should have served instead of those dinner rolls - nicely soaked in caramel custard and dotted with dried cherries, craisins, and pine nuts the steaming hot bread pudding was of good quality and firm texture; a good but not stunning representation on its own.  Moving next to the toppings - a trio of brown sugar streusel, praline cream, and American Oak ice cream the overall effect was sweet, sweet, and sweet - not inherently a bad thing, but a bit of overkill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FV0BkoGOd3Yu_eJnXY15ZA"}

The salad was fresh and the dish was edible, but at $16...even with the localdines certificate I felt ripped off.\n\nMoving next to a pair of sweets, Aileen opted for the Parisian Crepes with Apricot preserves, Cr\u00e8me Chantilly, and Berries and requesting the dish without powdered sugar I think we both kind of chuckled at the lackluster presentation but unlike the croque this dish was at least tasty; the crepes dainty with a goodly amount of sweet filling and the cr\u00e8me light yet flavorful but at $12 probably not enough to satiate all but the slightest appetite.\n\nFor our final (and certainly most decadent) taste of Boa an order of Stuffed Pain Perdu arrived featuring two pieces of brioche wrapped around a light layer of mascarpone and Nutella that was subsequently battered and dipped in hazelnuts prior before a trip to the pan.  Nicely caramelized with an exterior still featuring a bit of crunch and an interior just short of custard plus a topping of caramelized bananas, raisins, and maple the overall flavor profile was certainly sweet but at the same time nicely balanced and certainly a step up from the rest of the morning...even if nearly twice the price and half as good as the French Toast at Essence just hours before.  A 60 minute wait and $40 (plus tax and tip) for 3 items - only one of which was even remotely memorable - let's just say Caffe Boa won't see a starring role in my dinner plans any time soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iNT6pcUugoXsDlZgRTyhtw"}

Truly oldschool in terms of design, variety, and price with customers more like kin to the friendly staff it was clear on entry that the presence of a camera was not common around these parts and inquiring into my business I briefly explained, the end result a few laughs and rolled eyes followed by a multitude of suggestions and one congenial fellow refusing to allow me to pay, instead suggesting my half dozen be \"placed on his tab,\" a tab the clerk suggested he never pays anyhow.  Thanking everyone involved and taking my selections to the street it would not be long before the tasting began and opting for variety the most remarkable thing about Friendly was consistency; each fried pastry a textbook example of its genre with light yeastiness to the raised options and supple textures beneath a crisp glaze on the buttermilk and blueberry.  Moving next to an impressive Bismarck suggested to me as 'can't miss' by the table of two and then to a delicate cruller with thick cherry glaze it was largely expected that what followed would represent \"saving the best for last\" and sure enough both enormous bearclaw filled with spiced apples and the crispy apple fritter would prove the best I've found in Las Vegas and although perhaps not 'destination' worthy, certainly worth a visit for those in or around Henderson.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NLEy6m6hvVyfy0X829QGiQ"}

Undoubtedly a gluttonous meal but one priced competitively to that of KJ or Cathay House with food on par with the former and far superior to the second as items felt to be 'too old' by servers were twice delayed until fresh versions could be procured from the kitchen it was with a wide swath and steady pacing that we cut our path through a selection of over fifty options and with only the overly thick wrapper of the har gow and oily pan-fried mixed dumplings proving less than impressive to my tooth an 88% batting average was still quite impressive for any dim sum spot, let alone one situated well outside of Chinatown on an industrial stretch of South Decatur.  Having already spoke to the quality of the crispy roast duck and snappy prawns finding skillful balance between cream and crunch beneath a milky sweet sauce it should generally go without saying that freshest items proved the strongest options throughout our meal and with the herb-tinged congee a personal favorite along with molten baked custard buns I'd be remiss to not also mention a pair of novelties that proved equally impressive, the first featuring steamed egg custard topped with tender shrimp in an umami-laden broth and the second a delectable Red Bean Bun delivered  as a sticky golden spin on the cinnamon roll with a slight-savory finish bridging the classic Chinese ingredient to a Western palate in a way that many traditional Dim-Sum 'sweets' do not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg"}

the white linens, candles, and rose on each table all building on an atmosphere less-and-less frequently seen in modern dining realm. \n\nNavigating a menu steeped in heritage, many 'signatures' outlined while seasonal notes decorate a large collection of house-made pastas, it was with a basket of warm bread with oil atop caponata that the two-and-a-half hour meal began and with a bottle of white from the well-priced list soon poured for some a duo of sliced truffle alongside meatballs and polenta proved a decadent opening duo, both notably available as part of the 4-7pm happy hour in the lounge at a fraction of the a la carte price.\n\nTransitioning to Antipasti, the well sourced Affettati e Formaggio was presented as a veritable bargain at $18 with mortadella, prosciutto, and speck all shining alongside crumbly Pecorino and rich Gorgonzola, but acknowledging that none of these items are made on-site the true star was actually bowl of Mrs. Ferraro's sliced eggplant, an in-the-know sort of item served at the request of one diner that saw the oft-fried ingredient breathed new life through vinegar, sugar, and black pepper - each bite delicious on its own, but all the moreso when used taken as a poignant foil to the charcuterie's meaty sapor.\n\nJoking that an Italian Tasting Menu mostly means the chef will send out more pasta, round three featured a quartet of primi plated tasting-style by the kitchen plus a bowl of pasta created at the Sicilian Chef's whim, and although the risotto unfortunately came off a bit undercooked the four house-made noodles were undoubtedly amongst the best in the city, the signature Puttanesca not nearly as briny as one may guess from the ingredients while both gnocchi and agnolotti were tender bites of decadence, the artichoke pasta marrying discrepant flavors with brown butter a truly dynamic dish that hopefully represents a sign of evolution from a kitchen already well versed in the things it has long done well.\n\nSticking entirely to signatures for secondi it would seem obvious that no meal at Ferraro's should end without the city's most storied Osso Buco, and carved tableside by Gino with no more than a fork and spoon the tender meat in rich wine was just as good as rumor would have it, a compliment no less applicable to juicy braised rabbit served alongside lemony wilted spinach or the best tripe dish I've encountered stateside in quite some time, each supple bite rife rife with texture while the spicy sauce served to highlight the offal's intrinsic flavor rather than hide it like so many others.\n\nPerhaps mistakenly allowing the kitchen to decide upon dessert it was with a rather mundane chocolate cake that the evening was originally set to end, but having heard rumor of a tiramisu not to be missed a slice was requested along with four spoons, the sizable $12 wedge every bit as textbook as the menu's other classics with a delicate balance of mascarpone and cinnamon overlying feather-light ladyfingers ever so faintly accented with coffee and a the slightest hint of liquor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4GQhbPvGU5r23YdVm8EmkQ"}

Kitsch in d\u00e9cor with a pervasive log cabin theme speckled by bears both stuffed and carved it was to the tunes of the Four Tops that I entered Black Bear Diner and greeted first by a host behind the small pastry case and then by my server, Ray, the morning progressed in two courses with countless cups of coffee, the carving action outside visible through the windows while I dined.  Starting sweet and progressing sweeter it was to the flavor of custard-rich, ice cream crowned bread pudding that the meal began and rife with caramel, pecans, and raisins the steamy block proved surprisingly light while a duo of fresh baked breads with whipped butter and honey proved equally well done; the $0.99 cornbread toothsome and buttery while the $2.39 biscuit was so fluffy it literally flaked apart to the tooth.  Working slowly through the trio as wood chips flew it was only after the pudding was polished off that Ray put in my order for round-two and arriving piping hot the quartered cinnamon roll dressed in eggy batter and fried golden was superb, a light drizzle of cream cheese frosting mingling with the surprise of pure maple syrup into pure decadence - the sort of dish best taken with milk or coffee...and perhaps even better, shared.  At this point taking my leave and settling the bill it was with two additional items that I exited the cozy confines of the Black Bear and saving them until hours later suffice it to say that it was with some disappointment that I found the signature bear claw's pastry poorly laminated around pasty nut filling while the requested \"Cinnamon Apple Bavarian Cream Pie\" had been substituted by a standard, albeit delicious, traditional Apple Pie with a glossy butter crust instead - next time I guess I'll just have to enjoy all three courses at the table instead.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fkVBloMEFJG2HTgeCxeNDg"}

Every bit the elegant space with fine linens and a subdued color palate perched 55 floors above the casino below the Alize 'experience' begins the moment one exits the elevator and quickly whisked away to a prime Strip-side table after checking in with the hostess the night started out well, menus presented and questions answered with two resultant chef's tastings to follow including a single substitution granted at a $10 surcharge in order to experience Andre Rochat's signature Sole, a textbook rendition served with sauce Amandine that would prove the highlight of the meal.  Featuring the culinary talents of Chef de cuisine Mark Purdy with a trio of options offered at each course it was after an elegant amuse and a trio of breads matched to exquisite butter that the proper menu began and with bumbled presentations including several mispronunciations dotting the evening it should really come as no surprise that it was only after the meal that we were made aware that the \"first\" course carried an additional $20 charge, the caviar itself underwhelming in quality and quantity while the delicate fish instead proved the star of the show.  Moving next through the $135 progression of well appointed lobster salad to a standard duo of foie gras that soon gave way to the luxurious Sole and a pair of underwhelming lighter proteins before a thick cut of lamb it was largely with minimal risk that each course arrived and although culminating in a perfect souffl\u00e9 after well appointed cheeses one could not help but feel a bit bored, a lively conversation with my friend as the lights of the Strip illuminated notwithstanding, of course.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DoEMzev54WS8_lVLJ3NoqQ"}

Admittedly underwhelmed by more routine plates like guacamole, queso fundido, as well as carne asada and still perplexed as to why the restaurant would outsource something like tortilla chips when executing more complex items so well there is no doubt that a great meal can be had at Canonita by those willing to venture away from the tried and true, particularly when taking into account the vibe and the view.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UBvTnbaRD3h_dD6oXWLCBA"}

Clearly over ordering but happy to indulge, a single secondi of lightly braised lamb arrived rife with grassy notes beneath a savory glaze while the accompanying bowl of polenta proved sticky, rich, and decadent - the latter carrying right over to desserts, each excellent but the towering cloud of banana truly special and every bit as good as the one being served next door, still one of my favorite souffl\u00e9s to date.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LOef7o-dnn7Z5qGMZCi6pw"}

direction of GM Chris Zadie and Chef Michael LaPlaca, with pastry contributions from the team at nearby Heritage Steak, Portofino achieved a lot of recognition over the last few months thanks to stories of their 'diamond and gold' lasagna, but a closer look at the menu and words from friends in the know indicated there was much more to the story than savvy marketing, the native Ohioan toque reportedly turning out some of the best Italian food in the city with nearly everything from pastas and sauces made in house.\n\nPreviously known as Onda, and still sporting much of the original space's design, it was just moments before 6:30 when myself and two others sat down at the bar in wait for two more and with a friendly bartender offering up drinks and fluffy focaccia alongside lightly grassy olive oil blended with balsamic it would not be long before our group was complete, a white linen table on the upper level of the main dining room  seemingly miles away from not only the Casino beyond, but also the Wildcats and Badgers playing on silent televisions in the lounge.\n\nLarge in size, with a palate of beige highlighted by lines of cursive decorating the walls, it was mere seconds after seating that Mr. Zadie greeted our table and with wine from one friend already decanted the party's likes and dislikes were discussed,  a family style tasting to follow as light music played overhead.\n\nDivided into four courses, specifically antipasti, pasta, secondi, and dolci, it would not be long before the first round of food arrived and with Chef LePlaca personally presenting all four plates the descriptions were lengthy discourses clearly showing the young toque's passion for everything from sourcing to plating, each dish putting a unique spin on something traditional and familiar in order to show the concepts and ingredients in new light.\n\nStarting with salad and progressing to more substantial things, antipasti began with a Caprese punctuated by sundried rounds of tomato and garlic that acted to accentuate, rather than hide, the musky funk of fresh buffalo mozzarella and moving on to the signature crabcakes feigning as arancini one couldn't help but smile at the whimsy or diversity of flavors, a far more 'serious' composition found in the upcoming spring starter of tender octopus glazed in old balsamic atop spicy hash while the supple meatballs topped in stuffed squash blossoms made a strong case for best in Sin City, the pungent duo of cheeses melding effortlessly to bright tomato puree below.\n\nRepeatedly celebrated for their pastas, at least two now considered Strip-side staples, it was next in a quintet of family-style plates that we would indulge and eschewing a trend for undersaucing that seems more and more pervasive these days not a single option was less than superlative, the gnocchi so light they threatened to float off the plate were it not for the rich fonduta while tender agnolotti were every bit as creamy and decadent as ingredients would suggest, the rest of the lot textbook al dente with both the carbonara and fettuccini textbooks renditions while the signature wide-noodle 'ripatelli' performed a rarity with lamb, rendering it aromatic and vegetal as opposed to so rich as to overwhelm.\n\nAt this point allowed to choose secondi as dictated by hunger, a total of three entrees were selected and although the seared Branzino with two types of cauliflower alongside crispy mushrooms and polenta was flawlessly prepared it simply lacked the lust-inducing satisfaction of two other proteins, the osso buco defining the phrases 'fall off the bone' and 'cut with a spoon' atop creamy risotto while the upscaled take on Chicken Parm is a destination dish for any fan of the classic, a housemade sausage of leg and thigh wrapped inside a roulade of Mary's Free Range breast coated in the lightest of breadings beneath marinara and melted mozzarella.\n\nAdmittedly full at this point, the veal substantial enough to go around the table twice, it was finally in desserts that the meal concluded and with the hour just past 9:00pm as coffee was served my joke about 'all of them' proved a case of being careful what you ask for, five plates of dolci arriving at once with the semifreddo undoubtedly the most well conceptualized while the tiramisu was a surprising delicate take on the classic with light notes of cocoa, espresso, and cream lingering on the palate long after a meal that ranks highly amongst my favorites this year.\n\nNot yet a complete vision, the d\u00e9cor and desserts yet to be fully realized for an entirely new name and brand, Portofino is perhaps the most interesting take on \"American\" Italian food I've seen attempted to date and with a young and passionate team operating both the kitchen and front of house the question simply becomes one of filling a large dining room tucked away in the back corner of The Mirage, a gem becoming less hidden as more people discover the creativity and sing its praise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uCFoGYwwjXqsRdmD8Ecskw"}

Clearly not expecting the quality of Bouchon or Bonjour given the obvious discrepancy in price and production it was after a short drive and with coffee in hand that my sampling continued and starting small with an entremet of apple strudel the taste simply fell flat, a dry puff pastry with artificial tasting filling that carried right over a slightly superior tart again compromised by a core I'm rather certain was Smucker's supplied.  At this point with expectations decidedly dwindling it was into a soft almond croissant that teeth tore and discarding more than half of the doughy debacle before tasting a fairly forgettable black & white cookie I thankfully found some solace in the sticky pecan bun with ample notes of butter beneath a lacquer of cinnamon-sugar drizzled nuts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QNAH_yX7VZj-dQRwDKxsrQ"}

Nondescript from the exterior but cozy and kitsch inside as a friendly staff bounced between tables with endless refills of coffee from Illy at a mere $2.75 it was to a diverse menu and a hot, yeasty 'pot of bread' slathered with Nutella and toasted almonds that I arrived and after perusing the menu at length an order was placed, a server named Shirley warning me that it would be \"a lot of food,\" but failing to inform me of noted upcharges of $2 for a single Red Velvet Pancake and $1.25 for grits in place of potatoes.  Jovial in spirit with tunes ranging from Sinatra to Madonna playing overhead it was perhaps a ten minute wait after the bread that the rest of my meal arrived and with each item larger than expected in size it was indeed a substantial breakfast with only the cocoa-less Red Velvet failing to impress...the flavor merely that of a decent buttermilk pancake gussied up with $2 in dye.  Speaking to the rest, suffice it to say that it would be hard to mess up something as decadent as the signature \"S'Mores\" with ample chocolate chips and chocolate syrup finding balance in bold buttermilk, marshmallows, plus a dollop of whipped cream and yet as good as the pancake was, the un-fried riff on the Monte Cristo easily stole the show as golden Texas Toast dipped in custard housed Ham, Turkey, and Swiss of good quality and quantity, all just waiting for a sweet gilding of maple syrup to make flavors pop.  Never one to quibble prices but a firm believer that upcharges should always be disclosed Jamms strikes me as a good-enough place in a city with plenty of similar options; a bit better than some and a bit worse than others...the sort of place I'm sure to revisit at some point for the Waffle Sundae or the Stuffed French Toast, but not before investigating other family owned spots or before second visits to Blueberry Hill, Hash House, Egg & I, or Baby Stacks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "co0vxQ8ecXiBy2sGDeHi8A"}

Featuring house made, old school, all natural, hand cut Italian treats I rather expected to enter a large rustic space full off cakes, cookies, and confections - and to that end we most certainly weren't disappointed.  Greeted by a friendly young man as we watched two young ladies cut biscotti in the back I asked about a number of items that were not clearly marked and the three of us eventually settled on four separate options.  Paying with credit (I was actually amazed how many spots in the Burgh were cash only) we made our way to the car and drove to the National Aviary where we'd enjoy the desserts while waiting for the exhibits to open.\n\nHaving heard great things about the Chocolate Ravioli I'd ordered one - or at least I thought I did.  Taking a bite we'd clearly received the wrong order as the filling of the crisp and buttery shell yielded candied lemon peel.  Tasty, sweet, but definitely not what I'd expected.  Moving on to the next taste, a dish described as \"Strawberry Soft Biscotti\" we were yet again duped, but this time in a good way.  Sweet and cakelike this \"biscotti\" was most certainly not Strawberry but instead a sweet and complex amalgam of maraschino cherry and pistachio.  The best of our four options and also the most filling of the group I was quite happy with the biscotti while my mother and sister remained underwhelmed.\n\nMoving on to our second pair of selections, the drier of the options, we started with the \"Banana Walnut Biscotti.\"  Tasting minimally like banana, less like walnut, and mostly like a good sugar cookie all I can say is that it was nicely textured plain biscotti - I'm not sure if this was another mistake in our order or simply a lack of pronounced flavors.  Following the biscotti was a \"Blackberry drop\" Scone - a sugary biscuit with lush pockets of butter and thick whole blackberries - it was excellent.\n\nThroughout the rest of our visit to Pittsburgh we would see Enrico Biscotti at multiple markets, bakeries, and shops - clearly they are not hurting for fame or business, even if they are hurting for competent help at home base.  While none of the items we had were bad, only the scone was more impressive than an average quality version of the same thing at any good bakery - perhaps we just went on a bad day or perhaps we ordered wrong...then again, perhaps we ordered right and just got the wrong thing?", "type": "review", "business_id": "J2x_AMx591i6TK3xccEzqQ"}

With much sharing to be done and pictures taken the next twenty or so minutes would consist of much less talking and far more eating than the previous thirty and beginning first with my selection - well - let's just say it lived up to the hype as the ROSA with Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, and Arizona Pistachios may just be the best \"specialty pizza\" I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the crust - an expert balancing act between the thinness of a Neapolitan like Lucali and the chewy hole structure of that at Great Lake - it was nearly perfect as the slight char from the wood oven gave each pie a lovely crunch yet pliable interior that could support the ingredients without disturbing them.  Moving next to the toppings - no sauce here - just thinly sliced onions, intense salty cheese, crunchy smooth pistachios, and a touch of rosemary to pique everything else.  Marvelous.\n\nMoving next to another of Bianco's signatures, the WISEGUY with wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage I was pleasantly surprised by the mildness of both the onions and the fennel, both present but not overwhelming, while the slight spice of the sausage floated above the pools of creamy cow's milk mozzarella.  Another well balanced pie, though I do feel it could have done with just a touch less olive oil...a small quibble, to be sure.\n\nFor the third choice, the BIANCOVERDE with Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, and Arugula would be the only pizza we modified from the menu description - in this case by adding a $3 supplement of Organic 'La Quercia' Prosciutto Americano from Iowa that was every bit worth the cost.  Again featuring that same pliable smoky crust but this time topping it first with the trio of cheeses before adding the arugula and prosciutto after it exited the oven this \"Salad Pizza\" was a valuable addition to the lineup largely because of the quality of the ingredients and the balance achieved by using each lightly.  From the smooth mozzarella to the puddles of ricotta and tangy Parmigiano up through the slight bitters of the greens and the powerful saline notes of the pork everything simply clicked though for some the lack of spice was an issue - an issue easily amendable by the red pepper provided on request (try getting that at Una, Lucali, or Great Lake.)\n\nFor the final selection, that of the man who'd experienced Chris' work longer and more frequently than the rest of us combined, there was no way I was going to miss out on the MARGHERITA while I was here and thankfully he'd ordered it (thus preventing me from ordering both it and the ROSA.)  With the stars of the show well known - simply the freshest Tomato Sauce with light hints of sweetness, oregano, and garlic plus Fresh Mozzarella, and Basil - this was a no nonsense sort of pie that hit on all cylinders; tangy, creamy, aromatic, smoky, and perfect.  While not the absolute greatest Margherita I've ever had, a top 5 member for sure and when paired with the rest of the menu, the service, and the setting a pizza definitely worthy of the fame especially considering the fact that Bianco uses all local ingredients including tomatoes from California in the making of his sauce.\n\nEating, sharing, talking, and then eating some more while the service checked in occasionally to see if we needed anything else our time at Bianco felt much longer than it was and when it was all said and done only four slices remained - two of the WISEGUY and two the BIANCOVERDE - all wrapped up and going home with their respective owners while I took home with me the memories of some of the best pizza I've ever experienced and (perhaps more importantly) the experience of meeting with some great people for outstanding pizza in a setting where people have a passion for what they are doing without all the pretense.  Yeah Chris didn't build the oven and furniture by hand like Lucali, and perhaps Pizzeria Bianco doesn't fly all their ingredients in from Italy like Una, and sure Chris' health prevents him from being ever present at the oven like Dom at DiFara or Nick at Great Lake but in the end the results are the same...this is some really great pizza well worth going out of your way for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ"}

High points below:\n\nA native of a small town in the Midwest surrounded by farms heavily populated by Latino workers each summer of my youth I'm a bit ashamed to admit that overall my experience with \"Mexican\" food in general has been quite abysmal.  Sure there were childhood experiences with Little Mexico in Detroit before or after games at Joe Louis Arena and yes I've visited a few of Rick Bayless' spots in the Second City but beyond that and Border Grill in Los Angeles the closest I've been to South of the Border cuisine is Don Pablos...or perhaps Chi-Chi's before they filed for bankruptcy.  With these glaring omissions in my culinary education admitted and in part due to my overall lack of enthusiasm for spicy foods I promised myself going into this trip to Arizona that I would make an effort to at least hit some of the more upscale spots in order to \"ease myself in\" and the first of these stops would be at The Barrio Caf\u00e9.\n\nGoing light on the bread as it was somewhat uninspiring and the plates coming from the kitchen were surprisingly large it would be around twenty minutes after seating that my \"appetizer\" would arrive in the form of Tacos de Cochinita Pibil, four Mayan style slow roasted suckling pig tacos wrapped in house made tortillas with a side of Yucca fries, chipotle ketchup, and salsa Yucateca.  Beginning first with the tacos I'll simply say that while it may not mean much considering my lack of experience these were without a doubt the best tacos I have ever had.  Double wrapped due to the moistness of the succulent meat each bite was savory and smoky with a light acidity kissing the tongue as the queso fresco tamed everything.  Deftly spiced with any number of flavors foreign to my palate and going back and forth with the tasty fries I think the thing that really stood out to me with this dish was that while the \"heat\" was there, it served a purpose - pushing forward more unique tones like cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, and even sweetness from the meat.\n\nFor my main course; a dish titled Pato en Tamarindo or \"Seared breast of duck in a striking sweet & sour tamarind & chipotle pepper sauce.\"  With my love of duck well documented and already quite impressed with the flavor profile of the preceding tacos I have to say I went into this dish with high expectations and was met only half-way.  Beginning first with the accoutrements - mashed yucca with poblano peppers and asparagus with onions, both were tasty and well prepared if not particularly memorable.  Moving on to the duck, similarly well prepared with the breast first pounded thin and then saut\u00e9ed prior to a final sear, the issue with this dish would flash back to my complaint about \"spice\" because while the menu said \"duck\" my palate merely said \"protein\" as the flavors of the fowl were entirely obliterated by the thick notes of smoke, pepper, and slight bitters.  A good dish, sure, but for someone who truly loves duck I simply wanted to be able to taste it.\n\nWith the duck now consumed and feeling reasonably full but certainly not \"stuffed\" Esequiel again stopped by with a big smile stating \"Nice job, I knew you could do it.  But did you save room for dessert?\" - an obvious 'yes' which led to perhaps Barrio Caf\u00e9's most famous dish arriving at my table just ten minutes later.  Entitled \"Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra\" and trumping either of the previous dishes in overall mass this marvelous plate was composed of essentially five things and all five of them things I love; deep fried cinnamon doughnuts, chocolate, caramel, strawberries, and ice cream.\n\nBeginning first with the Churros - flawless, light, and crisp on the exterior with molten goats milk caramel spilling forth as they were cut...in all honestly they could have stopped here and I'd have been happy, but instead opting to pair this with an enormous double scoop of fresh vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with more caramel, slightly peppery \"Mexican hot chocolate\" and fresh strawberries...sure it was $12 for churros, but it is $12 I'd gladly spend again as I ate every last bite of the crunchy yet creamy concoction and spent another three or four minutes scraping the plate clean with my spoon.\n\nWith Esequiel returning yet again and asking, jokingly, if I'd enjoyed the churros he inquired (I hope jokingly) if there was anything else he could get me and telling him no, that the bill, I waited for a few moments while my tab was calculated - an admittedly pricey $58 after tax and tip - and with the bill paid I thanked the my servers for such a great afternoon before making my way back out into the sun.  Thankful for the meal that just was for opening my eyes in to a cuisine I've far too long overlooked I've no doubt that Barrio Caf\u00e9 is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Valley's Mexican scene, but considering what they say about first impression's I'm glad Chef Esparza and her team made a good one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1NZLxU5WvB5roPFzneAlLw"}

Surely the most 'famous' restaurant in Las Vegas and debatably the most well-known place for Thai in the United States the nondescript strip-mall location on Sahara Ave had always been on my \"to visit\" list and although my heat tolerance is still quite novice what I found at LoS was well within my comfort zone and aside from the nearly ninety minute wait for a seat and perfunctory service all of it was really quite delicious.\n\nFortunate to visit on a day when Chef Saipin was in the kitchen and the crowd was largely local our table of three tried as best we could to sample a wide but manageable amount of food from various areas of the immense menu and deferring once or twice to our server, Pha, we requested items arrive in a couple of courses as opposed to all at once; a request honored leading to seven plates in three rounds, each plate nicely presented, piping hot, and all but the Beef Ball soup full of flavor.\n\nBeginning first with savory fish cakes aromatic and spicy, prawns snappy and fresh with dipping sauce far sweeter than sour, and crispy rice with citrus proving an admirable foil to funky sausage the meal began with a bang only to falter slightly in the second round where the seafood shined while the aforementioned soup fell flat and the duck, advertised as crispy, was actually rather limp but quite delicious as the garlicky noodles, laden with fish sauce, provided needed balance to the substantial heat.  Last, largely because the kitchen forgot we ordered it until we inquired, but certainly not least - the Mussel Omelet arrived resembling a savory funnel cake - a slight sweetness beneath the brine and along with the Nam Kao Tod and Hoh Mok evidence to me that any subsequent trip to Lotus of Siam would see me focus even more strongly on seafood - particularly the snapper and catfish - while also taking a look at the Northern Thai menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

If possible, I'd give Emeril's Fish House 2.5 stars, but because of the experience and the dessert, I'll bump up.\n\nWent to Emeril's before Frozen Fury X last year, both my buddy and I dressed in LA purple.  Although not \"fine dining\" I worried that we would be underdressed, yet fortunately most of the people in the MGM were there for the same reason.  Go Kings Go.\n\nService was prompt, friendly, attentive, and intelligent.  Although clearly not a Kings fan, she knew the right questions to ask and was quite personable.  Bread (delicious garlic bread and a not-quite-Mina-quality cornbread) were served promptly and refilled continuously.  Drinks and water were also promply attended to.\n\nFor my meal I opted for Cedar Grilled Yellowtail with Potatoes while my buddy selected Filet Oscar.  While both presentations were relatively simple, the plating was attractive, the food was very fresh, and portions were adequate for the prices.  For a side we split Lobster Mac n' Cheese that was incredibly creamy and cheesy, yet with enough lobster that it wasn't overwhelmed.  Definitely the highlight before dessert arrived.\n\nFor dessert I was delighted to see two of my favorite items combined, one from the 95% of the time I eat healthy, and the other from the 5% when I don't; Sweet Potato Bread Pudding.  Served with a caramel cookie and marscapone icecream I'd say this was one of the 5 best Bread puddings I've tasted, though nowhere near the one at Emeril's Orlando location.  My friend choose a flourless chocolate cake with a Godiva liquor milkshake that, although small, was enjoyed greatly by my friend.\n\nAll told, I've certainly had better meals, but the place was above average 'dinner out.'  Perhaps I overrate it for great presentations of my favorite bread and one of my favorite desserts, but all told I think Emeril is a pretty decent chef who people like to pick on because he is a little over the top.

Obviously unable to rate the restaurant experience as a whole considering the fact that our 26 menu items were served almost exclusively by Chef Heath and the kitchen staff, there is little doubt in my mind that Emeril's New Orleans Fish House is as good today as it ever has been.", "type": "review", "business_id": "H6CJflwclNpttYrtsBMsVg"}

Foie Gras, Truffles, Shrimp, Lobster.....you name it, you got it.  While I do find it odd that I found myself being led into Burger Bar by my friend when I don't particularly like beef and don't eat burgers, I will admit to have had a few in the past and my all-time was the Thurman Burger in Columbus Ohio, a famous one in its own right.  In a day that included Tableau for breakfast and Alex for dinner I must say I didn't expect much from the Burger Bar....but I was pleasantly surprised.\n \nWhile the Bar was located in a shopping mall at Mandalay Bay I didn't judge....most of Vegas feels like a mall anyhow and Per Se in NYC is located in a mall, as well.  Arriving around 2:30pm there was a line...a good sign I guess....our names were taken and 10 minutes later we found ourselves seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant.  While the place was quite loud, conversation was quite easy and our menus were delivered quickly.  With 5-6 bread options, 5-6 meat options, 40-50 topping options, plus desserts it actually took longer to order than we had imagined.  Eventually I settled on the Turkey Burger on Ciabatta with grilled Shrimp, Pesto, and a side order of Sweet Potato fries while my buddy opted for the Kobe Beef Burger with Sharp Cheddar and Hickory Bacon on Whole Wheat with Spicy Skinny Fries and a sampler of beers.\n \nAs the place was busy we chatted for a bit and I decided to get up and explore.  Much to my surprise the kitchen was wide open for viewing and I wandered about to realize how fresh all the ingredients were, the bread being baked in visible ovens, and the meats stored in large lockers.  Everything appeared very hygienic and clean, very much unlike your average burger shack.  By the time I arrived back at the table my buddy was working on his beer and approximately two minutes later the food arrived.  While I spent a moment dressing my burger and eating my incredibly garlicky pickle spear, I heard my buddy partially-moan....clearly he was loving this burger.\n \nOnce my burger was adequately dressed and I had a large pile of ketchup for my fries it was time to dig in.  Crisp ciabatta with a fluffy interior first greeted my tongue followed by the wonderful basil blast of the pesto mingling with plump and tender shrimp and well cooked yet juicy turkey.  Great texture, quality ingredients, wonderful flavor, well cooked....what more can you ask for in a burger?  I next dug into the fries which were simply fantastic and #3 only to Michael Mina's Duck Fat Fries and Michael Symon's Lola Fries in terms of crispy outside and soft/salty inside.  I do find it rather unfortunate that the restaurant did not order an organic/original ketchup given the quality of the ingredients otherwise, but I guess a minimal amount of HFCS won't kill me.\n \nHaving finished off our burgers and laughing more at the PTI analysis of the USC/Oregon State result my buddy and I opted for a dessert burger - the chocolate version featuring a split donut topped with a chocolate gnache puck, mango \"cheese\", and strawberries.  Humorous in presentation and tasty in flavor, this choice was excellent and split down the middle this \"burger\" was just enough after the huge burger/fries.  The mango cheese was especially surprising in its fresh taste and jello-like texture while the chocolate puck was so rich I doubt I'd have finished one myself.  The donut was a tad dry, IMO, but didn't hurt the burger overall.\n \nAll told I liked the energy and the food at Burger Bar.  While certainly our most \"low class\" meal, I actually enjoyed the experience and the pricetag more than Sensi and Craftsteak and my buddy loved it which was excellent since he humored me in going to so many French restaurants on the weekend.  IMO, foie and truffles are best served by a chef like Stratta or Savoy and not on a piece of beef and buried under toppings...the concept of the Rossini Burger is ludicrous and anyone ordering it is showing off and missing out on the opportunity for more originality and customization at a lower price.  Regardless, to each his/her own and I think the concept of designer burgers has a lot to offer...even if the underdressed and uncustomizable option at Father's Office is still the standard by which most burgers are judged.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xyTJYlbE_MLouK6rCou6zg"}

I ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around BSing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced.\n\nFor meals, my buddy ordered the Mesa Burger with Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion, and Horseradish Mustard on a House Roll with Southwest fries.....the burger was enormous and per his word \"awesome.\"  I opted for the Thick Cut Ahi Tuna Nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas.  While it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu, I still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna I've yet to consume.  The portion was large and at only $11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread, nachos, soda, and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $15.\n\nWhile this isn't \"5 star\" dining, it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice 'bar' setting when in Vegas.  In retrospect I wish I'd have ordered dessert, but with dinner reserves at Simon later that evening I didn't want to overindulge.....y'know, after eating the Paris buffet for breakfast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

Driving up from Columbus early on a Monday morning we decided to kick off our trip with the legendary (albeit revised) original location - a small bar on 18th Street, at the heart of the Strip District.  Arriving at 9am we arrived between breakfast and lunch and found easy free parking before making our way into the heavily wooded and entirely homey feeling bar.\n\nFinding the location surprisingly empty (we were the only patrons) I was a bit put off as the two older ladies behind the register eyed us without saying a word.  Making our way further into the restaurant and chuckling at the legendary Pittsburgh caricatures lining the walls I rather guessed that the 24-hour nature of Primanti Brothers had left us with employees at the beginning or end of a shift as it actually required a concerted effort to place an order.  Not wanting to get filled up as we had a whole day of eating and museum hopping ahead of us we opted for a single sandwich and two \"pops\" to which our cashier stated \"is that it?\" almost incredulously.\n\nUndeterred we sat down and waited while our sandwich was prepped, dressed, and brought to the table on white paper.  By the time our sandwich had arrived another couple groups had entered the restaurant and our server's mood began to soften - a little.  Presented with a smile our Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich was quite good.  Thick yet yielding the white bread provided a great transport medium that stood up well to the sweet and savory slaw, crispy golden fries, salty bacon, creamy egg, and (honestly) somewhat underwhelming cheese.  Divided amongst the three of us the sandwich was enough to get a taste of what the restaurant was all about and enough for me to say the food largely makes  up for the service.  Much like many \"legendary\" restaurants (Tony Packo's, Central Grocery, etc) the food at Primanti's isn't going to blow your mind - but the setting, style, and experience are definitely something to witness when you're visiting from out of town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q4ULAiIE2qCA4RYplCTrUQ"}

Not a steak eater, the choice may seem a tad unusual until one realizes that this was now my fourth Emeril restaurant and fourth time I'd be sampling his take on Shrimp and Bread Pudding.  To be fair, I find it unfortunate that so many people consider Emeril a \"sell-out\" because he is on TV....he is still a good cook with some great recipes and one of the few celeb chefs who actually keeps his restaurants open for lunch along with dinner.  \n\nOn first impression, Delmonico seems rather boring in design.  A front bar/lounge and a back dining room with mostly whites and woods - Elegant but \"home-y\" would be the best way to describe it, yet slightly odd with the single spotlights peering down on each table.  Arriving around 1:45 I was toward the end of lunch hour, but was seated immediately at a four top in the front.  \n\nThe menu and bread were delivered swiftly, yet despite my knowing exactly what I wanted it took 15 minutes before the waiter returned for my order.  Creamy BBQ Shrimp with Fresh Baked Rosemary Biscuit, please.  \n\nOrder placed, I was given \"bread\" and \"butter\" from a side serving table....the bread was cool and dry while the butter was a block of ice....poor form.\n\nUnchecked upon until the arrival of my shrimp around 2:30pm, I sat and listened to the table behind me and took some pictures.  Thankfully, when my meal did arrive, the Chef's cooking once again spoke volumes.  7 huge shrimp, 3 small rosemary biscuits, and a sauce that can only be described as a mixture of honey, hickory, and cream with a slight bit of spice....it was lovely.  With all the shrimp finished and significant sauce left over, I requested more bread and this time was \nthankfully brought two piping hot rolls glistening with butter.  While these were delicious and used for mopping up the sauce, it does not excuse the awful first bread service.\n\nWith my main gone a different waiter appeared and asked if I'd like dessert.  Darn right I said, having sampled 3 of Emeril's Bread Puddings in the past (one of them twice....we actually went back to Emeril's of Orlando for Bread Pudding after the version at Emeril's Tchoup Chop disappointed....not that I'm obsessed with bread pudding or anything.)  On the menu at Delmonico?  Banana Bread Pudding w/ Oreo Ice Cream.  \n\nServed in a tiny pot, the moist and liquidy Banana Bread was fantastic, yet so hot that it had turned the ice cream into a melting puddle before it even arrived.  The icecream itself was pretty standard fare and didn't really compliment nor detract from the pudding.  Having had Banana Bread Pudding twice in the past, this was the worst of the three and nowhere near as good as the Sweet Potato Bread Pudding at Emeril's Fish House or the Bourbon Cinnamon version at Citywalk Orlando.  As many have noted before, Vegas seems to have a thing for runny bread pudding, yet the three best I've tried in Vegas have all been the more dry version.  \n\nAll told, the shrimp was truly standout while all other aspects of the meal were pretty average....and the cold bread....poor poor from.  From what I've heard the steaks here are delicious and I'd certainy return to sample other menu items, but given the vast number of Vegas choices (and two better Emeril restaurants, IMO) I doubt I'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YacTpiq0ZptFcXD7I-kdGA"}

Drinking plenty of water and showering I'd worked up quite an appetite and made my way out for another walk south on the strip - this time to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  Arriving at 7:20am I was greeted by the friendly hostesses at the door and led promptly to a prime seat on the patio where I watched Vegas roll by - the best part about early morning Vegas is that there are only two sorts of people - the early morning joggers and the people just heading home.  I laughed like hell when a guy came up and yelled \"high five - yellow shirt - I love yellow shirts\" with regard to my vintage LA Kings T.  Only in Vegas.\n\nHaving heard much about Mon Ami Gabi's view - truly awesome sitting 4 feet above Las Vegas Boulevard and directly across from the fountains at Bellagio - I must admit I'd heard mixed reviews of the food and went in with tempered expectations.  Greeted by my server and handed a menu I was offered coffee which I graciously accepted.  A decent French Roast with heavy nuttiness the coffee was good, but probably the worst I had during my trip to Vegas...and refills were slow at best despite the restaurant being unfilled throughout my meal.  Browsing the menu I was impressed by both the sweets and the savories - deciding between the Blueberry French Toast and Poached Pear Waffles proved difficult and thus I ended up with neither.   Placing my order I also opted to order a pain au chocolate from the limited bakery menu.\n\nSitting for nearly 30 minutes while I waited for my food I sipped my coffee and watched the street - I've said it before and I'll say it again, half the \"Vegas Experience\" is people watching.  Eventually arriving along with only my first refill of coffee (I had to request it - thankfully after this service improved and a young man took over my coffee refills) I was somewhat surprised when the sweet arrived with my savory breakfast.  Cool and questionably fresh the Pain au Chocolate was appropriately buttery and flakey but lacked any pizzazz.  Featuring a small single vein of average chocolate I could've gotten the same dish for much less than $3.50 at most convenience stores.\n\nWhere I would consider the sweet a failure - I didn't even finish it - my savory at MAG was actually a unique take on a classic and quite delicious.  Described as a \"classic\" Croque Madame the dish was actually presented in a \"deconstructed\" fork and knife sandwich manner with two large slices of hearty grain bread pan fried in butter and then cut in half, topped with ham and gruyere cheese plus chives, and finished with a sunny-side up egg.  Accompanying the croque on the plate was a simple salad of frisee and vinegar and on a side plate were some oily and uninspiring (and decidedly American) hash browns with Heinz ketchup poured into a small cup.  While good this croque and accoutrements certainly wasn't as good as the version the previous day at Pinot and no-where near on par with the versions in Northern California at Butler and the Chef or Bouchon.\n\nFinishing my meal and sipping on my coffee again my female server finally returned to my table to ask if I needed anything else - when I asked for a \"to go\" cup of coffee plus the check this duty was pawned off on the young man who'd been filling my coffee while she went back to talking to the other female server near the register.  Like Pinot I simply don't understand why \"bistro\" entails sub-par service in Las Vegas and I actually mentioned on my way out suggesting that I wanted my tip (left in cash as opposed to on my credit card as I normally do on vacation) be given to the young man and not my \"server.\"  In general I can't say there is much to brag about at Mon Ami Gabi aside from the view and while the restaurant would certainly stand at the top of French cuisine in Columbus Ohio (my home) I'd much sooner go back to Pinot, Bouchon, Payard, or Tableau when in a dining destination city like Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

Referred to by some a 'stodgy' with fine porcelain, silver, and lush fabrics to accompany formal service plus a cigar and cognac lounge my experience at Andre's began a few days prior with an E-mail to Ms. Jana Lane Southard requesting a copy of the menu plus a supplemental classic to the chef's tasting and with both requests granted to the tune of a small surcharge the dinner that followed was a true fete of three plus hours of near-perfect food and drink.  Noting up front that beverages were not requested, but instead comped to the tune of me leaving more inebriated than I'd prefer, it was to a glass of brisk bubbly that I was welcomed and proceeding next to the almost-too-rich-for-one \"Marti Foie\" with a quartet of accoutrements my palate was soon warmed with a gamy croquette serving notice of bold flavors to come.  Moving past mundane bread and frankly disappointing chilled butter it was with my upcharged request of demi-portion of Rochat's classic Thermidor that my tasting began and served in a high-arched bowl the only thing more impressive than the portion was the prep as the butter-poached crustacean proved snappy-sweet amidst a sea of cognac custard studded with tender vegetables and light aromatics.  Opting next for a caramelized seared steak of grade-A foie gras over savory fruitcake tinged with verjus and paired with Tokaji it was only course three that proved anything less than perfection as a slight over-sear dulled a freshly shucked scallop amidst flavors plucked from Robuchon, a small gaff not repeated in the plump sweetbreads or duet of duck - both amongst the most memorable preparations I've found in the state of Nevada.  Transitioning to cheese, an area where I think Andre's could certainly expand its selection, before an impressive palate cleanse it was at long last that a dessert long anticipated arrived; a tall and proud souffle with a tableside finish proving whimsy and perfection can indeed coexist as cocoa, cream, and cinnamon melded seamlessly into an ethereal pudding.  Rounding out the night with brandied cherries, chocolate, and a swig of cognac before settling the tab with a hefty tip it was with nothing but smiles that I exited Andre's; my only regret being that I'd waited so long to do so.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UO80ofDOenKF4QWR2z-oKA"}

I must say, in a weekend that included meals featuring the vision of Stratta, Keller, and Ducasse it was only Colicchio who failed to impress.\n \nFirst off, our waiter (Team #6, Cashier JR T) did not introduce himself for 15 minutes, actively avoiding eye contact when it was sought.  Thankfully the water and bread servers were on the ball.  When the waiter did introduce himself it was as though it was an epic hassle for him to explain the family style menu.  Additionally, though the MGM site lists $100 and $110 menus with chefs vs. personal selection, the waiter acted unaware of these entirely.  When he finally \ndid concede that the site had these options, only the chefs choice was offered.....and stuck to.....without question.  \n \nWhile the online menu suggests three mains, three salads, three appetizers, three sides, and three desserts we were only offered the option of two appetizers with all other items to be selected for us.  When I attempted to order the scallops and the foie we were informed that both were out of stock.  Fair enough, the place was busy and my buddy already ordered his 10oz Filet cooked rare so I opted for the Yellowtail Tuna with olive and tomato cooked as rare as possible.  These choices made our waiter disappeared and we were brought the much hyped bread and butter.  While the bread was good, it certainly wasn't on par with the similar version served at Table 10 or Delmonico and the butter was rather cold.\n \nSalads arrived in a matter of minutes and consisted of the Butter Poached Diver Scallops with Fennel (I thought they were out?,) Satur Farm Mixed Lettuces with Olive Oil and Vinegar, Heirloom Tomatoes, and Prosciutto San Daniele.  Admittedly all dishes were good with the scallops and Heirloom tomatoes being particularly excellent.  The scallops were butter braised and lightly poached with a perfect sashimi-style inside and lightly crisp exterior.  The tomatoes were amongst the best I've ever tasted with a mild olive oil and balsamic marinade bringing out the acidic and sweet flavor of each of the 5+ varieties...as my buddy does not like tomatoes I was given the bulk of these lovely items and was greatful to oblige. \n \nSoon after the arrival of salads and appetizers we were brought our mains and sides which consisted of the aformentioned 10oz Fillet and Yellowfin Tuna with Olive and Tomato tapanade, Whipped Yukon gold potatoes, Mixed Mushooms (Lobster, Hen of Woods, Shiitake, Chanterelle) in Garlic, and Sweet White Corn.  As was the case last year in Vegas my buddy got me to try a piece of steak which he claimed was better than the Grade 12 A5 Waygu at Alex....it tasted merely like beef to me but he claimed it to be the best steak he'd ever tasted.  My tuna was quite excellent and cooked flawlessly with the interesting contrast of sweet tomatoes and bitter/briney olives forming an excellent medly of flavors.  Not the best yellowtail I've experienced, but certainly fantastic.  \n\nLike the mains and appetizers, the sides were delectable and featured a stockpile of woodsy mushrooms simply presented and delectable in taste - I was particularly thrilled to get such a large lobster mushroom as it lags behind only a morel as my favorite fungi.  The corn and potatoes were equally simple yet wonderful with the corn almost 'sugar-sweet' and the potatoes velvety, buttery, and wonderful.\n\nThe meal was slightly sabotaged here, once again, by our server who committed multiple mistakes.  Number one:  My friend ordered a half bottle of wine for $65.  Once again in his avoidance of us the waiter forgot (admitting this and apologizing later) until after appetizers were consumed and mains/sides delivered....and considering we were essentially rushed out the door by 11:15 (we received mains at 10:25) wine consumption was anything but leisurely.  Number two:  More bread was promised.....it was never delivered.  When sides were given and we were asked \"is there anything else you would like?\" I stated we'd like to try the Sweet Potatoes.....they were never delivered. Number three:  Well, read on...\n\nDessert was next and given my love for bread pudding and souffle (and the rave reviews I'd read of each) I specifically explained to my waiter, in great detail, that these were my favorites and that I'd heard good things about the versions at Craftsteak.  In response to my accolades the waiter simply noted \"we do lots of great things\" and proceeded to serve us NO bread pudding or Souffl\u00e9.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HbUQ_3dlm3uCacmhTEMnuA"}

In a city with so many great options I would not generally be the sort to 'forgive and forget,' but returning with my two friends - both who love steak - and remembering how good the food was I made contact with the restaurant through the MGM website.  While Mr. Bartucci (and our server) had apparently since been dismissed from the restaurant, my e-mail was answered by the new General Manager, Sebastien Vallet, who invited the three of us back for the chef's tasting with wine pairings on the house. \n\nTaking our seats we were almost instantly met by Mr. Vallet, a gregarious and friendly man in a great looking grey suit (vastly differing from the black/white clad servers,) who promised us a fantastic meal and confirmed that I did not eat beef while my friends most certainly did.  \n\nWithin moments our waters were filled - bottled water without even requesting, and our server and his assistant came to our table to once again confirm likes, dislikes, and anything we may need.  In order to not belabor service issues too much I will note a couple of issues here that, despite their obviously being overly attentive to our table, were less than impressive.  First, while Sebastien stopped by multiple times, our server spent vastly more time at a table of well clad businessmen while the assistant served as our primary server throughout.  While not \"unfriendly\" our assistant's grasp of the English language was poor at best, wines were not described as presented, and this was officially the only restaurant on my trip to Vegas where I had to fill my own water.  Another service issue presented itself later, but otherwise I have to say the team clearly \"went out of their way\" to please us - yet despite that fact, the service at Mastro's, CUT, Carnevino, and myriad other fine dining establishments vastly outpaced Craftsteak - their \"average\" being better than Craftsteak's \"best.\"\n\nBrowsing around the restaurant I was amazed at how many hockey jerseys were present - clearly not the \"business casual\" Craftsteak desires.  Arriving from our assistant server without any description (approximately 1 minute later our main server showed up to tell us what the dishes were) our mains and sides were served with a red wine of which I'm unfamiliar and neither myself nor JT enjoyed - Brad thought it was decent.  Featuring mains of a 16oz Ribeye, a 12oz Skirt, and Divers Scallops with Fennel and sides of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Wood Roasted Asparagus this is where the other service issue came up.  As previously noted, I don't eat steak - that doesn't mean my buddies do not eat scallops.  Featuring only five scallops (we received three of the exact same dish as an appetizer last visit) and my friends each deserving to try at least one I explained to our server that this wasn't acceptable and, surprisingly, met some resistance - apparently my thin frame made him think I can't eat.  Asking if any other fishes were available I was told only tuna - again the same prep I'd had last year (there was lobster, I saw it on another table, but clearly they weren't giving this away) and inquiring about birds or pork I was told only chicken (I know they had duck and pork loin, I saw the nightly menu) so I requested the chicken.  Consenting, begrudgingly, the server asked if we wanted anything else and I emphatically stated some mushrooms would be nice.  While it took about 15 minutes to prepare, the dishes were indeed brought by yet another server - someone who actually smiled (aside from Sebastien.)\n\nMyself - I was pleased with the food again, but still less than sold on the service given the fact that they were clearly \"doing their best\" and still seemed a little less than in-step with other restaurants of their caliber.  When it was all said and done Mr. Vallet stopped by to see how everything had been and I told him it was good - because it was.  It simply wasn't \"great.\"  Leaving a nice tip for our service team (perhaps had they known we'd be leaving a good tip the primary server would've been more available) we made our way out of Craftsteak for the last time.  Impressed enough that I plan to check out Craft the next time I'm in Los Angeles or NYC, Vegas has plenty of other options in the meats market and if I were attending repeats I'd head to CUT or Carnevino first.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HbUQ_3dlm3uCacmhTEMnuA"}

Having consumed ~$100 between two at Bouchon Bakery in NYC back in June, my expectations entering Bouchon Bistro on the 10th floor of the Venetian were high....at least 10 stories high.\n\nDue to their rustic simplicity and historic preparation by poor persons utilizing limited ingredients, I personally believe gnocchi/dumplings (along with Bread Pudding) to be the ultimate foods by which to judge a chef and knowing that my time in Vegas would be limited, I e-mailed ahead approximately 2 weeks early and asked if it would be possible for the chef to prepare the Gnocchi a la Parisienne during the weekday breakfast hours.  While an odd request for sure, my e-mail was almost immediately answered by General Manager Andy St. John who stated the chef would be delighted to prepare the meal during the day at no additional costs, no questions asked.  Gnocchi for breakfast?  Well, kinda...\n\nArriving at Bouchon around 7:30 I checked in with the host who introduced me to dining manager Robert who took me to my seat, indoors looking out at the pool given the bright sun and my fare skin.  Water was delivered and I was given a few moments to browse the restaurant before my server returned.  The simple bistro layout, the open doors to the pool and garden, the fresh smell of the baking breads....lovely.  When Robert returned specials were discussed, despite already knowing my strange request, and I settled on a starter of the Chocolate Almond Croissant and a cup (make that about 6 cups) of coffee.  See, the croissant was Breakfast...the Gnocchi just followed closely.\n\nThe croissant, like all of Keller's pastries, was magical...the best croissant I've ever had in terms of flavor.  Crispy and warm on the outside with chocolate drizzle and copious almonds, plus a flaky interior and a thick layer of chocolate gnache folded into the flaky dough and then loaded with chopped almonds.  If I lived close to a Bouchon this would be a very frequent indulgence to say the least.  The coffee...thick, robust, french pressed...the best priced cup of coffee in Vegas for sure.\n\nA couple more coffee refills and it was time for the main course (consumed with water, not coffee.)  Without further ado, I will just say that this dish redefined gnocchi in all ways.  Unlike Italian gnocchi, the French style utilized butter in the noodles along with the potatoes and the effect literally creates a dumpling that melts on the tongue.  Every single piece appeared hand crafted, perfectly tender on the outside, yet toothsome and textural on the outside.  The dish was complimented with carrots, spinach, mushrooms fricassee and beurre noisette as dressing and the entire effect was simply perfection on a plate.  I honestly cannot think of the last time it took me so long to savor each bite of a dish, but by all accounts I believe I ate each piece individually, slowly.  Such simple ingredients, such flawless execution.  \n\nCertainly I love foie gras, blue lobster, diver scallops, and desserts considered to be delicacies, but I also appreciate when simplicity yields perfection.  While I've not been to French Laundry or Per Se, both will have their time in the sun in the near future...but for now I will simply state that if it is the little things that count, Bouchon is doing ALL the little things right from superior service to setting to food.  After breakfast I made my second of four visits during the trip to Bouchon Bakery for a carry-along snack...two days later I returned to Bouchon for Brunch, my only repeat of the trip....yes, it was that impressive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

With that in mind, as a rule I generally don't revisit restaurants, especially when on vacation.   How is it that I found myself back at Bouchon only 2 days after my original experience you might ask?  Because dollar for dollar it is the best restaurant in Vegas.  It's the same reason I found myself at Bouchon Bakery four times in four days.  Call me obsessive if you like, I consider it a pursuit of perfection and as of yet I've not found anything in terms of food or service that Thomas Keller does less than perfect.\n\nArriving for Saturday brunch around 7:50am the night after dinner at Alex one might assume I was both happy and full...and difficult to impress.  One would be correct.  With those things in mind, the Buckeyes and Gophers game was starting at 9:00am and I was meeting friends at the Palazzo Sports Book so an early trip to Bouchon was ideal.  Seated outside I was once again greeted by the same fantastic service I received on trip one and was presented the specials including a phenomenal sounding Lobster gratin, Lorraine quiche, Strawberry croissant, and Cauliflower soup.  While the gratin was incredibly tempting the draw of the French toast bread pudding was simply too much this time around and my neighbors had the cinnamon beignets which appeared heavenly.  One French toast, one order of beignets, and a coffee please.\n\nUnlike the first time, for this meal I was started off with Keller's famous epi-baguettes which I first experienced in NYC back in June.  Still wonderfully crunchy on the outside and soft and buttery within and served with that sinful sweet butter and raspberry preserves the baguettes were gone by the time my beignets arrived.\n\nThe beignets, as expected, were incredible.  Having tried the custard and Raspberry filled versions at Bouchon Bakery the day before I opted for the donut-esque versions this time around which were served with a beautiful apricot jam and a pot of warm Nutella.  Light, airy, sweet, and still warm/glistening the beignets were much more than a \"donut\" and when dipped in the Nutella were even better than Ducasse's famous madelines from two nights prior.  Magical.  Losing myself in the morning sun, wonderful taste, and bold coffee I slowly indulged until all the jam and nutella was spent.\n\nPlates cleared and table dusted off for posterity, my coffee was refilled and returned along with the French Toast.  Smaller than expected, yet delicate in appearance I dug in slowly expecting to be amazed...and amazed I was.  While small, the taste was compact and potent with a creamy texture of butter cut by the texture of spiced apple and the fragrance of cinnamon.  Syrup was utilized sparingly, yet wonderfully to create a masterpiece without overpowering with sweetness.  While not a \"true\" bread pudding in the sense of the one served at Bouchon Bakery, this is my second favorite bread pudding ever behind only Nancy Olson's life-altering version at Gramercy Tavern.\n\nMeal finished I paid my bill and thanked my server for the wonderful meal.  All things being equal I would have returned for a late brunch around 2pm in order to check out the gratin or chicken and waffles, but after hanging out at the Sportsbook for a few others my buddy made other plans.  Oh well, at least I made my fourth and final stop at the Bakery on my way over to the Palazzo for some mid-game snacks.\n\nTwo meals in four days, four stops at the Bakery, and a previous visit to the NYC location back in June...certainly not normal for me...then again, there is nothing normal about Bouchon; it is fantastic.  With fellowship interviews coming up later this year I fully expect myself to wind up on both coasts for interviews...if schedules work out, a trip to French Laundry, Ad Hoc, and/or Per Se is almost a guarantee.  Until then, Thanksgiving will certainly feature the Bouchon Cookbook quite prominently.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Truely a \"chef's chef\" I've always respected his desire to remain authentic, to not let his empire spread too far or too wide, and his strong dedication to the progression of America's culinary scene - donations to the Culinary Institute, working with the US Culinary Olympic team, etc.  Without overstating, though I still rank Alinea as my favorite meal of all time, I consider Keller my favorite chef.  Having been to each of Keller's restaurants except for Per Se in 2009 it was only logical that I make my way back to Bouchon for Saturday brunch on my most recent trip to Las Vegas - especially since it was only 2 floors away from my hotel room.\n\nArriving at the doors of Bouchon around 7:50 there was already a line of 8 people waiting and by the time the doors opened at 8:00 there were nearly 20.  Browsing the sign of specials I thought the crabcakes benedict sounded good, but not nearly as good as what I'd come for originally.  Making my way into the restaurant and meeting with the hostess I asked for a table for one outdoors if possible and was swiftly taken to the precise table I enjoyed the previous year.  Handed a menu to browse my coffee was filled (so much better than the coffee at the continental breakfast) and I was brought a water after declining a cocktail.\n \nReturning after a short time my server explained the specials and asked if I had any questions - stating no I placed my orders and requested some of the infamous epi-baguette to go with the house made butter and fresh preserves (strawberry this time) that were already on the table.  Receiving a \"branch\" of two pieces - and later two more - these wonderful pieces of carbohydrate reminded me again of just how good a simple baguette can be when using quality ingredients.  Creamy and grassy the butter went largely underutilized instead opting for the jam which displayed the very essence of strawberries and a small cup of nutella (an unexpected $2.50 surcharge.)\n\nBeginning the meal along with my second cup of coffee was a slice of Almond Brioche.  Served piping hot from the griddle the bread was buttery and sweet with perfectly toasted almonds contrasting well with the soft bread.  Similar to the brioche served with the foie gras terrine at The French Laundry (plus almonds) this was toast at its very best.\n\nMy main course, arriving with another refill of my coffee (yes, I have a caffeine problem) was the dish I knew I'd order the moment I decided to return to Bouchon - Keller's Chicken and Waffles.  Unobtainable at any other Thomas Keller restaurant (much like the French Toast Bread Pudding) the mere thought of this dish had me excited and it certainly didn't disappoint - better than Roscoe's, Crops, or Seldom Blues...by far.  The chicken, instead of being traditionally Southern fried was instead marinated in thyme and rosemary, then slow roasted for 13 hours and pan-flashed to crisp the skin.  Perfectly smooth, incredibly juicy, the chicken alone would have justified the trip.  Further enhancing the impressive plate were the waffles - four quartered pieces accented with buttermilk, bacon, chives, and (per the server) a bit of chicken stock.  Served alongside the main components of the dish was a delectable Tahitian vanilla bean butter, pure Vermont maple syrup, and sauce chasseur - essentially a gravy of chicken stock, bacon lardons, mushrooms, and onion.  A flawless array of crispy and soft, savory and sweet, nuanced and \"in your face\" - an absolutely lovely dish worth every penny of the $25 pricetag.\n\nSitting and sipping my coffee in the sun rising over the Venezia pools I couldn't help but think about other meals at Thomas Keller restaurants - honestly, aside from a stale cinnamon brioche (admittedly a flaw,) a piece of cheese (simply not my style,) and some spicy walnuts ( good, but not at that time in the meal) I've not yet had an item that was less than impressive - and many items were not just impressive, but formed the prototype for what I think that item is in its near-perfect form.  While service can sometimes be a tad \"cool,\" or \"stiff\" it is always professional and the settings, ingredients, and experience uncompromisingly refined.  While I still have to try Verandah and Hash House a Go-Go to complete my \"to do list\" for breakfasts in Vegas, unless they truly wow I do believe I'll simply be frequenting Bouchon from now on when visiting the strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Open for breakfast, brunch, and dinner I'd been to Chef Keller's Vegas Bistro on each of my previous three visits to Las Vegas and the opportunity to eat Christmas Brunch there with the three most important people in my life was simply too perfect and obvious a choice to pass up.  Having contacted the restaurant to be sure they'd be open on Christmas I was informed that they were indeed open but not taking reservations as is their Saturday Brunch policy - I was also told there would be \"holiday themed\" specials available.\n\nWaking early to be sure we'd arrive plenty early I have to admit I was a tad surprised when we were the first people in line at 7:45am, though we'd quickly be joined by twenty or so others before the doors opened with a pleasant Merry Christmas from the staff at exactly 8am.  Checking in at the hostess stand we were quickly whisked away to a great four-top near the windows overlooking the pools at the center of the Venezia tower and presented with menus.  With water poured the next person to visit our table would be our server, a pleasant young woman named Arlene who would live up to Bouchon's customary service - interested and forthcoming, knowledgable and efficient.  Describing the chalkboard specials (no \"holiday themed\" options to be found) and taking drink orders we were left to ponder our choices.\n\nWith two coffees, a tea, and orange juice served and refilled consistently (save for the orange juice) by the ever circling bussers we sat for mere moments before the ever-welcomed epi-baguette would arrive, this time with that same lovely butter and apricot preserves.\n\nStarting the meal proper and finally dining at Bouchon's brunch with a group I was this time able to order the pastry basket I'd previously held off on for fear that it would go to waste.  With four options to the basket plus one included with my aunt's Breakfast Americane the basket would actually be a silver platter with a blue cloth.  Featuring a cream cheese Danish, Pecan Sticky Bun, Orange Currant Scone, Chocolate Almond Croissant, and two Raspberry Beignets each taste was everything I've come to expect from Bouchon bakery and both the Cheese Danish and Orange Currant Scone were truly remarkable given the fact that I generally would not have ordered them at other restaurants.  Rumor has it that Keller is working on a Bouchon Bakery cookbook and this experience once again made me hope the rumors are true.\n\nFor my mother the choice would be a dish familiar to myself from two years prior; the bread pudding style French toast.  This time using D'anjou pears as opposed to the Bartletts from my visit but again with lovely layers of custard interspersed with cinnamon spiked compote of fruit between each layer there really isn't much that can be said about this dish that hasn't been praised before - a touch of maple syrup, a dust of confectioner's sugar to finish a truly decadent breakfast.  To temper the sweetness she also ordered a side of bacon - 7 thick strips of apple wood smoked Kurobuta pork for a mere $5.\n\nFor my sister, still feeling the effects of the gluttony at Picasso the night before, something light was desired and the decision was made to sample Keller's Waffle recipe.  Spiked with vanilla and so crispy on the exterior that I'd not be surprised if cornmeal was involved, the interior of the waffle was supple and spongy - textbook.  Topped with fresh bananas and chopped walnuts at a cost of $12 I can't say this was a cheap waffle, but all things considering it was light, tasty, and unfaultable.\n\nMy breakfast selection would be from the chalkboard.  Described merely as Oeuf du jour with Crab and Macaroni Gratin the dish itself would be served in a steaming hot low-ramekin.  Featuring tender macaroni intermingling with plump chunks of crab, gruyere, breadcrumbs, and butter at its base the dish was subsequently topped with two medium scrambled eggs and sauce Mornay with paprika and chives.  Creamy yet textural, slightly briny but sweet, and buttery beyond anything I've had in recent memory the dish was perhaps the best savory I've ever had for breakfast and the golden brioche served alongside harkened memories of Per Se and The French Laundry.\n\nWith plates cleaned our bussers would clear the table rapidly and Arlene would return with the check - no offer of dessert, just a \"No Rush - Merry Christmas and thanks for having brunch with us today\" as she handed us the check in a glass cup.  A tad annoyed at the lack of promised \"holiday themed\" specials we settled the tab and made our way to the door by 9:05 - a mere hour after we entered.  While certainly a good meal with great company this visit to Bouchon was a letdown largely due to heightened expectations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Tired but excited I walked in and mentioned I had a reservation for one to which the beautiful attendant stated \"Ah yes, Dr. U, we've been expecting you.\"  At this point I was handed off to a team of fantastic servers who showed me to my window-side 4-top and the extravagance began.  I'll get my complaints out of the way early....there was a spot on the tablecloth approximately the size of match-head...no more complaints.  Perfect service, flawless timing, full descriptions, elaborate presentations, the gorgeous interior and fountain show outdoors....and a customized tasting menu as follows:\n\nAmuse Bouche:  Komomoto Oyster w/ American Caviar - I'm not an oyster guy, nor a Caviar guy, but the presentation was gorgeous and the flavors far more subdued than past tastes.  While I cannot say I'll ever appreciate these two items as much as other haute-cuisine, I can definitely say I'll look forward to my next unexpected encounter.\n\nBread Basket:  Pretzel, Walnut Olive, French Baguette w/ salted and unsalted butter.  The Baguette was crunchy and perfect for soaking up sauces, the pretzel crispy and salty outside and buttery soft inside, and the olive walnut simply sublime.  Better Pretzel than Mastros or Yankee Stadium, Better olive than Gramercy Tavern.  Runner up to Spago for best basket all time.  Better yet - After the first three courses I'd eaten one piece of each and went to grab another piece of Baguette for sauces when the waiter whisked it away and replaced it with a piping hot fresh basket stating \"it isn't as good when it cools.\"\n\nCourse One:  Lobster Salad w/ avocado, frisee, hericot vert, black truffle - A Le Cirque classic and for very good reason.  Beautifully poached lobster over a puree of avocado and hericot verts, a layer or frisse, and a drizzle of black truffle dressing topped with a shaved black truffle.  Delicious as it was decadent, a beautiful way to start.  (note: the truffle was fresh and quite good, but certainly more for effect than taste....like plastic surgery on a super model....it was already great, but here is that extra unnecessary touch.)  \n\nCourse two:  Sauteed Foie Gras w/ microgreens, petite chestnuts, white peach, blackberry, cranberry - Sublime.  Fatty and flawless inside, just slightly crisp outside.  Served warm and sweet with a brilliant contrast against the tart berries, crispy peach, and crunchy nuts with the microgreens added for texture.  While not quite as innovative as the version at EMP, better in flavor.\n\nCourse three:  Crispy Sweet Breads w/ Fig and grape marmalade, veal reduction, butter basil foam, asparagus/heirloom tomato/mushroom salad - A substitution for the seasonal risotto and absolutely worth the decision.  A single sweetbread panflashed and crisp served beneath an airy butter and basil foam over a flavorful salad the dish was further enhanced by the addition of two smears of fig jelly that provided a sweet component to the already incredibly savory dish.  The veal reduction was poured in a small ring around the dish tableside and was my first experience with what the sous-chef could really do...until dishes four and five.\n\nCourse four:  Paupiette of Sea Bass with Pinot Noir sauce, crispy potato skin, microgreens and shredded savoy cabbage - Another Le Cirque classic and another winner in every way.  Perfectly poached bass with a crispy paper-thin skin served over a crispy salad and covered with a sauce that can only be described as heavenly.  Sweet and winelike yet bold and buttery, refined yet complex....more bread, please.\n\nCourse five:  Organic chicken w/ Foie gras macaroni, truffle, asparagus, tomato compote - My second substitution as I don't favor beef and a second wonderful choice.  Clean and tasty chicken with thin shavings of black tuffle beneath the crispy skin served over a layer of long handmade macaroni and a transcendent sauce of mushroom puree and foie gras.  Wonderfully crisp asparagus and a beautifully complex grilled tomato compote lent additional flavors to the dish, as well.\n\nPalate Cleanser:  Tequila Sorbet with gold leaf, dragon fruit, dinosaur plum, coconut milk, and edible bowl - More pineapple than tequila, this sorbet was divine and a mere sign of things to come.  The fruit compote was delectable and the coconut milk wonderful for offsetting the citrus.  I'd like to say I knew the bowl was edible, but initially when I broke it I was worried....I think this was expected as my server then stepped in to suggest I \"try a bite.\"  The gold leaf....we'll chalk that up to extravagance, it had no flavor.\n\nSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4EhFsjWBSaSp_5TkkLp7LA"}

Admittedly unable to fairly assess the 'experience' under the circumstances in which I dined - carte blanche, truffe blanche, vin blanche, gratuit - but instead opting to focus on the skills of 28 year old chef Wilfred Bergerhausen and what he placed on our plates it was with a glass of the restaurant's signature cocktail of raspberry puree and brut bubbles that the evening began and although perhaps an 'expected' pairing I'd be hard pressed to name a better amuse than the briny eggs over creamy salmon that chives that arrived next, each of four bites slowly savored from the only utensil fit for such a job.  Asking for a mix of the new chef's plates to be served alongside longstanding classics both the salad and pasta courses showed Le Cirque's dedication  to quality of sourcing and although the modernist-kiss of shaved torchon atop a texturally compelling salad proved a brilliant carrier for the early season truffles it was the follow-up plate that quickly stole the show - a mountain of Tuber magnatum the only thing holding down dumplings so light that they threatened to float off the plate.  At this point abandoning any attempt to stay my hand from further trips to a bread plate that rivals the city's best it was a tender scallop over fall-fruit 'risotto' that arrived and liberally ladled with white chocolate sauce the flavors popped, even the scallop-skeptic in the group relishing the experience as I mopped the terrine clean with warm white chocolate and walnut bread.  Transitioning here to heartier flavors it was to a stack of rabbit saddle, confit, and offal ravioli that we were treated and with a finishing touch of crispy spatzle the longtime classic was reborn, the grand finale of duck a l'orange equally timeless with novel twists finding it stuffed in lavender and rosemary while a small bowl of duck consomm\u00e9 featured slowly melting slices of foie gras, the semi-sweet red served at its side a brilliant pairing with light acid and smoke lingering on the end.  Bridging savory to sweet with a trio of aged cheeses, more bread, and fruit puree I'd have gladly eaten by the spoon it was in a trio of desserts and a tower of mignardise that the meal ended and although both the chocolate sphere and champagne parfait were lovely, neither could hold a candle to the souffl\u00e9 - a classic soon to be remastered under the talents of a new pastry chef by month's end, and a reason in and of itself to warrant an expedited return.\n\nDespite several offers to pay the bill we were refused at all turns but lumping together a pile of cash to at least compensate the remarkable service I'm confident to say that at this very moment Le Cirque's kitchen is executing on the level of most Michelin 2* restaurants I've been to in Europe or The United States, a statement I reserve for less than a handful of restaurants in Las Vegas and one that becomes even more impressive when you look at the price point - the tasting menu under $150 with service from a team that has largely been in place since the restaurant opened its doors 16 years ago.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4EhFsjWBSaSp_5TkkLp7LA"}

Clearly the sort of restaurant where subtlety yields to gluttony it was largely a desire to sample more items that led to us taking a pass on the infamous \"Fat Elvis,\" instead ordering a quartet of items beginning with decent, if not particularly memorable chicken over waffles and a buttery blueberry muffin before moving onto things far superior, the first a stack of golden French toast soaked with custard but crisped by cornflakes and loaded with fresh berries plus mascarpone and the second, quite literally, a flaky \"turntable-sized\" cinnamon roll rife with butter, cinnamon, and bacon that rivals the best I've found and will invariably be ordered again just as soon as I find someone to go back with me to tackle that signature stack of 14 bacon and banana pancakes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_VN5hYv1VgNIBgwxTQZ_1Q"}

until I recalled what treasures were to come.\n\nAcknowledging my limitations as relates to alcohol, and as such imbibing in only two-and-a-half glasses of Perrier Jouet along with at least three-fold as many refills of coffee during the course of my 175 minute stay, it was with a deliberate pace and path that I worked my way through the buffet's offerings, a first plate featuring the restaurant's heralded omelet prepped to order with 2oz of caviar, a trio of blinis, and a nicely grilled lobster tail plus freshly drawn butter at its side.\n\nGenerally underwhelmed by buffet seafood, but immediately impressed by both the lobster as well as the caviar, a second trip saw snappy shrimp set beside another tail, more roe, plus two types of crab and although the cold pre-cracked claws were a little more grainy than I'd have hoped the King Crab was as sweet and succulent as most found in fine dining establishments spanning the strip, a follow-up of benedicts from the kitchen taking far too long to prepare and meagerly decorated with protein when compared to what customers can just as easily gather themselves.\n\nTaken by the delicacy of noodles surrounding lobster ravioli topped in a sauce quite similar to the bisque, but richer when thickened by hot cast iron, and more than a little surprised at just how supple the slab bacon was when sliced to order, it was here that sweets would first be sampled and although the miniature waffles topped with whipped cream and macerated fruit plus a drizzle of maple syrup were a nice balance of crisp, pliable, and yeasty the laminated pastry given a custard bath before being baked into French Toast was an absolute show-stopper, easily amongst the best in the city and far superior to many that cost $17-20 at several 24-hour cafes.\n\nSpending some time admiring decorations fashioned from reappropriated utensils, the restaurant now nearing half-full with several inebriated patrons pushing the noise level to a dull roar, it was unfortunate that neither the flimsy bacon nor run-of-the-mill sausage were any better than that available at a neighborhood diner while the tiny slice of filet mignon was almost inedibly cooked past well-the tender lamb chops as well as stuffed chicken proving far better seasoned and prepared on my final plate of savories before rounding out the experience in to a quartet of plates featuring small desserts, fruits, cheeses, and nuts.\n\nAt this point losing track of the server who seemed to be covering half the room, it was to the GM that I appealed for another cup of coffee and tasting through each of the sweets presented from the bar up front only two items really stood out - the hazelnut tart for its ability to reinvent Nutella into an ever-so-light mousse and the Cheesecake whose sour thickness was absolutely the opposite, a far better bite found in a small bowl of grilled peaches and candied bacon atop fresh pulled burrata that sat unannounced on the cold bar next to an equally fresh berry and yogurt parfait.\n\nWithout a doubt an experience, the quality of the cuisine and beverages easily justifying the cost for fans of shellfish and those capable of drinking their fair share of bubbly brut, Sterling Buffet lived up to its 'bucket list' billing as one of those places that everyone should try once, the impetus to return a matter of tastes and budget, particularly in a city where far more vast spreads can be found at a mere fraction of the cost.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dl5K9Hc2kUcGcrVIQAOhWQ"}

the journey presented to our table a slightly augmented nine-course affair in part selected by Mr. Richards and partly on request, a few fine wines as well as a cocktail, tea, and coffee rounding out an experience that stretched just over three hours.\n\nBeginning almost entirely empty, and perhaps half-full when the meal ended at 9PM, it was largely with tableside service from Warren plus one of his captains that dinner at Bartolotta progressed and after opening bites of lightly fried squid plus bread that proved absolutely irresistible across several rounds it would not be long before the first of several stunners arrived, the duo of Italian Mullet and  roasted Ricciola each simply presented with light saucing over vegetables, the brine of anchovies and bitter radicchio particularly inspiring when paired to the sweet, buttery Amberjack.\n\nDiverting from sea-life momentarily on request, plate three featured a dollop of foie gras rendered almost incomparably light through the utilization of butter, booze, plus plenty of technique and slowly savoring each bite trying to recall a better presentation of duck liver in recent memory it was in the subsequent course that the restaurant's tableside treasure chest truly showed its importance to the experience, both the enormous langoustines and slipper lobster that had been alive just moments prior showing the sort of quality rarely seen on either coast, let alone at the center of a valley without a drop of saltwater in sight.\n\nAgain venturing back to the bounty of land for the first of two pasta duos, Bartolotta certainly lived up to its Italian inspirations with both the delicate potato dumplings as well as the cheese ravioli draped in a veil of Pecorino and buttery wine glaze, yet as good as both the small portions were, neither could live up to the quality of a subsequent course of seafood slanted primi, the inky risotto a briny yet creamy composition while the signature 'rags' tasted like a textbook cioppino with just enough acid from the tomatoes to balance the fresh crustaceans with hints of herbs and wine lingering on the finish.\n\nSelf-selecting a still-blinking San Pietro from the glass case as the culmination of savories, course seven saw the roasted John Dory deftly plated tableside over lightly roasted zucchini and although edges proved ever so slightly parched the center was rich, moist, and absolutely indulgent while a trio of sauces served to silence any talk of over-cooking, the Cruda and Agrumi equally well adapted to the white flesh with the later equally delectable drizzled on wheat bread of which far too much had already been had.\n\nAt this point declining an inquiry as to whether anything else was desired to be added a la carte, it was undoubtedly a bit of showing off that saw eighteen of the restaurant's twenty-four housemade iced delicacies delivered as a palate cleanser to trump any experienced to date, and although I'd like to say restraint was shown the fact of the matter is that little more than a few puddles returned to the kitchen - only the mango proving less than a spot on interpretation of the ingredient's natural flavor while the Coconut, Amarena Cherry, Black Currant, Pistachio, and Dark Chocolate were all amongst the city's best frozen bites.\n\nSipping a sweet Moscato while desserts were readied, and later ordering up an iced Americano to pair with the sweets, it was largely a Chef's selection that rounded out the evening and having previously been underwhelmed by Italian desserts throughout much of the city the quality of the quintet at Bartolotta proved every bit as inspired as the savorites, the Lemon Cake and Semifreddo each a great option for those favoring fruit-based flavors while the baba and spuma were rich and traditional with bold flavors amidst exceptionally light textures, the budino undoubtedly the heaviest of the finale with rich chocolate pudding finding its foil in sweet passion fruit plus one more quenelle of gelato.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n_QAA70NrnGIsGjog3HF_Q"}

Served curled around the cr\u00e8me fraiche the salmon was excellent - more firm than a sashimi prep, but similar in taste.  With the caviar somewhat less briny than others I've tasted it worked well with the somewhat sour cr\u00e8me while the egg added its characteristic creamy flavor.  The Potato soup was a commendable potage - the creamy texture balanced nicely with the onions and chives.\n\nWith myself ordering the 5-course degustation, largely unchanged over many years at Picasso, and Erika opting to go Prix Fixe for more choices our first courses would arrive simultaneously.  For my first dish, Maine Lobster Salad - Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette was ample in portion, elegant in presentation, and lovely on the palate.  With thick chunks of chilled lobster in a light cream sauce serving as the base, the \"salad\" was essentially microgreens tossed with apple-cider accented vinaigrette atop.  Flanked by melon balls and tomatoes of varying colors the dish was quite light, a wonderful opening volley even if it was much more \"lobster\" than \"salad.\"\n\nCourse two was a Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau.  Served with a potato crisp standing playfully behind the single monstrous scallop the dish looked beautiful and the tastes were lovely, albeit predictable with the savory veal reduction balancing the sweet scallop.  With the creamy potato puree loaded with butter the place where this dish missed was in the centerpiece - gorgeously caramelized to the point of a near brulee on the exterior the scallop was simply a bit too well done at its center.  While certainly a competent and lovely preparation the fact remains that perhaps twenty less seconds on the pan could have elevated it to a whole different level.\n\nThe next course would provide my sister with an empty charger while I would receive the Saut\u00e9ed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras with Poached Pears, Huckleberries, Crushed Pistachios, Lemon Zest, and Rhubarb.  A large steak of 3-4 ounces of high quality and perfectly cleaned Foie Gras, the liver itself was everything you would expect.  Placed atop a \"cake\" of compressed pistachio and topped with roasted crunchy pistachios kissed with lemon the textures were a nice contrast and exceptionally complimentary.  Swirled with rhubarb reduction and plated alongside a poached pear with huckleberries this dish did not attempt to reinvent the wheel, but it was quite memorable for its classic approach.\n\nThe main course was Roasted Lamb Chops with Sweet Bell Pepper Farci turned out to be quite the substantial portion - easily 7-8oz including the bone.  Prepared rare and extremely juicy yet easily cut with the side of the fork this was without a doubt a top-5 all time lamb preparation.  Presented simply with rosemary, a stack of buttery potatoes, and a m\u00e9lange of sweet bell peppers this would prove my favorite dish of the evening, regardless of how good the Foie Gras was.\n\nHazelnut and Coffee Opera with Coffee Hazelnut Ice Cream and Brown Sugar Filberts was quite impressive in presentation.  With a thin wedge of moist cake served on edge with a \"shadow\" of Hazelnut dust the flavor and texture of the cake was somewhere between almond dacquoise and tiramisu.  Resting happily next to the tall and proud cake, a small ball of similarly flavored ice cream atop candied nuts - creamy and crunchy, a nice cake and ice cream combination but certainly nothing to write home about.\n\nMaking our way from Picasso I must say I left with mixed emotions - not because anything was bad - as a matter of fact, everything was quite good.  The issue was that aside from a lovely Christmas Eve with my little sister at a restaurant that seemed unattainable a mere 8 years ago, nothing was \"great\" aside from the d\u00e9cor and art.  In the end I think Picasso has maintained its place in the Vegas culinary scene - it is just that many other restaurants, and my own personal dining preferences, have perhaps grown to be something more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-5RN56jH78MV2oquLV_G8g"}

Additionally, the Alaskan King Salmon Tournedos were flawless, fresh, perfectly seared, and delicious.....and about 1/2 the price as the same amount of meat as Bartolotta at the Wynn.

Having already browsed the newest Jean-Philippe boutique multiple times during our visit and having tried the original at Bellagio in the past we were thrilled to note that as opposed to Bouchon, Jean Philippe was fully embracing the holiday theme.\n\nHaving experienced the Nutella gelato and Tiramisu on past visits to Jean Philippe at the Bellagio I personally was wowed by the vastness of the new shop's selection - from cookies to candies to confections and ice cream everything looked excellent and given the length of the line we were given plenty of time to decide.  With the space at Aria including a dining area in addition to the vast shop my mother and sister made their suggestions and went to wait out a table - a successful bid that would land us a four-top overlooking the gaming floor only moments before we paid our bill.\n\nBrowsing the selection and deciding on a dessert each, plus an enormous chocolate covered strawberry and a coffee the items were plated on clear plastic trays with the Chef's signature logo - a nice touch softening the blow of a $38 tab.  Splitting each item into fourths in order to design a miniature dessert tasting our selections would be a \"gift wrapped\" Carrot cake, a Nutella Brioche, a Snowman Tiramisu, and a Chocolate Bouche de Noel.  \n\nWith each item a stunning example of Jean Philippe and team's handiwork I still think this is one of the best Tiramisu dishes to ever grace my palate and the Bouche was vastly superior to that at Bouchon Bakery just days before.  With the Carrot Cake loaded with a citrus toned cream cheese, raisins, and plenty of texture and the Nutella Brioche featuring the texture of a Croissant with easily two tablespoons of the Hazelnut filling within everything was divine, especially when paired with the subtly chocolate toned coffee.

Boulevard eateries, the same to be said of crunchy Waffles and golden French Toast studded with white chocolate, the Crespelles creamy as can be though a little slight in citrus.\n\nBolstered by refilled pots of coffee and water that was repeatedly topped off without request, Italian is well represented in pizzas as well as a few hot skillets, the \"Sinatra Family\" meatballs small but tender with a bright tomato sauce while Parmesan Chicken eats lighter than one might expect, the garlic knots and polenta also well executed, though those with more modest appetites might be well advised to avoid such \"filler.\"\n\nPassing on Sushi, Shrimp and Salmon, instead opting for a dim sum trio as well as a bowl of congee dressed up in pickled vegetables and a good bit of century egg, pork buns were unfortunately a bit bland while spring rolls and potstickers were both pleasant, the Thai style chicken wings surprisingly meaty with heat and sweetness kept in good balance.\n\nWell represented in breakfast meats as well as roasted chicken and glazed ham, the beef rib and peppered slab bacon both missing the mark by being too dry and too heavily seasoned, respectively, macaroni and cheese sees an upgrade through the use of sharp white cheddar while Cajun Shrimp atop baked grits is one of the buffet's best bites, the same flavors not as well represented in the benedict's overly thick hollandaise.\n\nNo doubt a sucker for sweets, likely the least costly part of the buffet in terms of those looking to 'get their money's worth,' baked goods including olive loaf and focaccia are nicely made, as are croissants and danishes, a collection of bruleed oats, museli, yogurt, granola, and various fruits all quite nicely presented, the chia parfait not really my thing though the lady at a table next to mine raved about it.\n\nTaking the Petit Four approach to desserts, low sugar and gluten-free options available to those seeking such things, cookies are a decided must-miss as none are better than those from a  package, the S'mores tart also disappointing with no smoke or graham cracker flavor evident, far better bites found in the cakes from which both Cracker Jack and Strawberry Shortcake were memorable, as too were the Apple Parfait and liquid centered Brownie, less so the sticky toffee pudding which was just sugary sweet.\n\nTold that the bread pudding is a Wynn Signature, the Butterscotch laden scoop setting a high standard for anything one might find in all-you-can-eat form, it was perhaps even more surprising that the seasonal cobbler was a textbook rendition underneath Vanilla tinged crumble, the only thing preventing the overconsumption of each being limited remaining room in the stomach, that filled by three small scoops of ice-cream, the selection of a bowl over a fresh-made cone indicative of the amount of food eaten, but the malted version so rich and nuanced that there was some brief thought of going back for seconds.", "type":

more fruit served on request with only perhaps an ounce and half of the liver going uneaten...and only because we were told there was more to come.\n\nUndoubtedly acknowledging the effects of so much Foie, and as such sending out a plate described as 'very light,' it was next in the Three Seas Tasting that our party indulged and true to the captain's word each bite on the oblong plate was indeed a study of refinement, every bite displaying its ingredients with maximum impact without weighing on the belly more than a bit - the kitchen coaxing all sorts of nuance out of scallop, langoustine, and snapper through proper preparation and pairing with ingredients to accent and emphasize the subtleties of each.\n\nStill not finished, even with one member of our table ready to wave the white flag, savories would conclude in rare slices of American Wagyu set beside upscale traditional accoutrements and a deep, dark sauce of Pinot Noir and with the small piece of short-rib perhaps even more memorable than the ribeye itself a duo of sides would prove no less impressive, the textural sprouts beneath a pile of crispy leaves amongst the best in the city while the creamy polenta knows no local match in terms of texture or taste, the use of real truffles making all the difference in a city where oil so often is used to please the naive.\n\nJokingly suggesting that 'all' the desserts would be the best way to close out the night it was perhaps my 'fault' that what happened next did occur and with two varieties of sweet wine in hand it was to a quintet of servers that our evening would end, one of Michael's signature Root Beer Float and Chocolate Chip Cookie plates landing before each diner along with one each of the restaurant's current seasonal desserts, each an entirely different experience ranging from ethereal panna cotta to dense chocolate cake with the warm clafouti falling somewhere in the middle, each tender bite rife with fresh berries while tangy cr\u00e8me fraiche and buttermilk sorbet slowly melted at its side.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZNdsRbGeOfrYYPRl6AziCQ"}

Calling ahead for reservations for three we were told they were mostly booked but had a four-top available at 1:30. Standing up and walking to the windows I looked out over the amazing 18 holes of greenery that Mr. Wynn had built in the middle of the desert - quite possibly the most impressive \"architecture\" in the Wynn empire.\n\nWe made our way to our table and were met by our witty and surprisingly down-to-earth and casual server.  Explaining some of the daily specials while handing us our menus the waiter quipped about his favorite dishes, the design of the restaurant, Chef Guia's culinary pedigree, and the multiple celebrities who'd sat in our very seats - Bill Murray and Michael Jordan to name a few.  While clearly intending to impress I actually found our waiter to be a pretty genuine individual throughout our meal - something a bit different for \"Wynn service\" which is normally a bit starchy and unapproachable.  \n \nSitting and chatting for a little while we were soon brought refills of our waters and diet cokes and a large basket of bread - fresh from the oven.  Served with a soft and fragrant butter the bread itself was almost a cross between a brioche in density and a soda bread in texture.  With a lovely crunchy crust giving way to a soft and buttery center we devoured the first basket before our appetizers even arrived and ended up finishing a second basket before the mains were completed.  \n\nFor Matt and myself why not get a sweet for one course and a savory for the other?  For an appetizer, the French Toast Bread Pudding with Vermont Maple Syrup, Berries, Candied Pecans, Glazed Bacon - essentially two large English-muffin sized pieces of custard laden and smooth maple bread pudding stacked and surrounded with fresh berries and candied pecans - then topped with a slice of thick and perfect maple glazed bacon.  Honestly - no offense to Thomas Keller's similar option at Bouchon - but this was better.  A m\u00e9lange of vanilla and maple, cinnamon and butter, and crispy exterior yielding a custard-like interior - it could've been breakfast, it could've been dessert - and it was one heck of an appetizer.\n\nAfter a wait, more talk, more fries, and more coffee our mains arrived.  For myself, Two large organic poached eggs with BBQ Smoked Pork, Bacon Cheese Muffins, and Charred Green Chile Hollandaise.  Somewhat \"Tex Mex\" but also at the same time as refined as a traditional Benedict it is hard to say what aspect of this dish was most appealing - the maple-heavy pulled pork, the creamy poached eggs, the spicy hollandaise with only mild hints of sour, or those indelible English muffins.  Rupturing the eggs and allowed the dish to flood with a combination of creamy and spicy, sweet and savory I have to say the result wasn't as pretty as the presentation, but the flavor was fantastic.\n\nFor dessert our waiter recommedned the Bombolone for dessert and stated it was one of his five favorite dishes in Vegas.  Taking him on his word I agreed and approximately 15 minutes later the dishes arrived.  Entitled Chocolate Bombolone with Brioche Donuts, Berries, Creme Anglaise, and Chocolate Sauce the dish was simple - five 72% dark chocolate truffles dipped in brioche batter and deep fried only long enough to brown the outside and liquefy the center paired with a smooth vanilla anglaise, fresh berries, and a hefty dark chocolate sauce.  What the dish lacked in complexity, however, it more than made up for in flavor.  Instructed to place the whole bite into my mouth before chewing each bite simply burst forth with chocolate on masticating.  Small in portion the richness of the chocolate was a perfect way to end a great meal and any more would have likely been too decadent to finish.\n\nSitting and chatting for another half hour before our departure our drinks were continually refilled and our server occasionally stopped by to be sure all was well.  Never rushed as it was the end of the brunch service I was impressed at how laid back such a refined restaurant felt - it really did feel like a \"member's only\" club where people were welcome to socialize as long as they like.  Very happy with the meal and the uncharacteristically casual feel of a Wynn-core enterprise I have to say that aside from Bouchon, the Country Club may be my favorite mid-day meal in Las Vegas.  A great view, great service, great company, and most importantly - great food - definitely a meal worth a day away from Bouchon's breakfast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xy54RutATsomOfsDVR-m_Q"}

Arriving at our seats, another two individuals appeared, one to check my coat upstairs, the other to assist us with our chairs.  Water - crystal or sparkling?  Crystal.  \"Very good, doctor.\"  To be fair, this meal was months in planning and my friend and I were upgraded to \"VIP\" status by a friend at the restaurant, but regardless of that fact the stellar service was above and beyond what was expected.\n\nMenus were received along with a wine list and approximately 5 minutes later the first course of canapes arrived from the kitchen.  As we browsed the menu and debated the stellar tasting vs. the incredible list of ingredients on the prix fixe the experience began with a scallop chip piled with otoro and caviar, a Berkshire bacon wrapped Granny Smith apple, roasted heirloom pepper soup, and a gruyere cheese puff.  While all four were absolutely sublime, particular favorites were the otoro and caviar with its fatty salty balance and crispy chip as well as the gruyere cheese puff which literally melted on the tongue and clung to the palate.\n\nAfter much perusal and debate, selections were made and the somellier stopped by to chat with my friend about wine pairings for the choices.  When my buddy admitted his naievety the somm, not pretentious in the least, suggested it was okay since he \"just made it up as he went along.\"  Two wines were selected by the somm and my friend stated both were excellent, albeit $30+/glass.  After orders were taken, course two of canapes arrived including a Cucumber and salmon bouche,  Carrot and spicey ginger soup, a king crab BLT, and a torchon du Foie Gras with apricot and pistaccio.  Once again, all choices were explosive and dynamic with the carrot soup and its heavily layered flavors as well as the Foie presenting most prominently.  The foie was so good that it almost made me wish I'd selected it as an apetizer....almost.\n\nBreads and sweet butter next appeared consisting of four types served by our attendant.  Choices included Orange Rosemary Ciabatta, Buckwheat, Toasted Corn Bread, and Cranberry Sunflower seed.  Each selection was tried once with an additional slice of cranberry sunflower seed selected with my main and all were superb with their crunchy crust and moist/dense substance inside.  Just after bread, a final amuse arrived in the form of a Kampachi Rillet with raddish, daikon, and savoy cabbage slaw topped with lotus root over balsamic - creamy, sweet, acidic, and beautiful.\n\nFor course one I selected the European blue lobster with Savoy Cabbage and Coral-Verbena Sauce while my friend chose the Napoleon of King Crab w/ Sweet Carrot Sauce, Jicama, Fuji Apple and Avocado.  Given the rarity of blue lobster, I simply could not resist the opportunity and honestly it may have been the best dish I have ever tasted.  More textured and sweet than its Maine counterpart, the butter poached tail rested atop whole claw similarly poached and wrapped in cabbage.  The whole presentation was then drizzled with an incredibly creamy yet savory sauce with a hint of vanilla.  It was mesmerizing.  \n\nWhile I cannot comment on the flavor of my friend's dishes, he claimed that the apple was the predominant flavor and secondarily the crab.  Regardless, it was beautifully presented and quite large in portion.  \n\nAs part of our 'VIP' status we were next provided a second appetizer on the house, my friend receiving the Parmigiano Risotto w/ Roasted Porcini Mushrooms and Crispy Chicken Oysters and myself lucky enough to receive the Veal Sweetbread Piccata with Roasted Porcini Mushrooms, Parmigiano, Arugula.  While I missed the sweet component of other presentations, my dish was fantastic with two large pan-seared and crispy sweetbreads along side two enormous Porcinis and atop Arugula with shaved Parmigiano on top.  My friend's dish which he graciously allowed me to taste was incredible with a level of creaminess almost unfathomable and a texture of silky perfection offset only by the woodsy mushrooms and crunchy chicken.\n\nSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aGulqXnFmpOh_5Qh96uBng"}

Sitting down in the bar area I was instantly glad I'd made a reservation - possibly the busiest restaurant I saw during my whole trip to Vegas the average wait for a party of 2 was 30 minutes!  After approximately 5 minutes I was led to my table - a small two-top at the edge of the main dining room and thankfully somewhat isolated by the intensely loud interior of the restaurant.  Greeted by my seemingly overworked server I was asked if I wanted wine and when I declined she simply disappeared for approximately ten minutes, a theme of absence that would recur frequently during the meal.\n \nEventually returning to take my order and fill my water glass I had spent plenty of time browsing the unique Cali-French cuisine of Chef Eric Lhuillier and when I asked regarding the foie gras on the dinner menu I was told that the chef would be glad to prepare it - placing my orders I was left to wait - again for an excessive amount of time. Thankfully in my server's absence another young man took the onus to attend to my water glass while another well dressed server brought me a couple of fantastic dinner rolls.  Served with small chunks of cold and unsalted butter the rolls were served piping hot from the oven and had a great ratio of crusty salted exterior to soft and airy interior - they were actually so buttery sweet that adding the table butter was entirely unnecessary.  Being sure not to overfill like the prior day I limited myself to only two pieces of bread and plenty of water while I waited.\n \nArriving literally after the table across from myself had ordered, eaten, paid and departed, my first dish was indeed my special request from the dinner menu - and while there was nothing special about the service at this meal, the dish continued a theme of quite exceptional food that was started by the rolls.  Described as \"Chaud froid of seared foie gras - Pickled pineapple and heirloom radishes\" the dish was actually presented as a large pile of artisan greens and shredded radishes with great snap and pieces of duck confit intermixed over the top of two medium sized lobes of warm seared foie atop a chunk of incredibly tart yet savory pineapple.  While clearly following a formula of balancing the unctuous foie with the sweet components of fruit and adding greens for texture I actually loved this preparation for the pickled pineapple and the manner in which the acid mingled with the foie.  The foie itself, while good, notably did have a couple of small veins that clearly would not have \"made the cut\" at a higher end restaurant - regardless, for an item not regularly prepared at lunch it was quite nice.\n \nFinishing my foie the plate was left on the table for some time (the table across from me still sat uncleaned as well) before my main course arrived - and even after delivery of my dish the empty plate remained.  Service issues aside, the food once again impressed - this time a classic Croque Monsieur served with crispy garlic frites and a small salad with oil and vinegar.  Not usually a fan of fries I will say these were superb - the best I'd had since those at Bouchon with their Croque, actually.  Served with gruyere and cr\u00e8me fraiche as opposed to the more traditional Mornay or Bechamel sauce I have to admit I liked the \"tang\" from the creme and the combination of the buttery brioche, savory cheese, and well prepared ham made for an excellent sandwich - not as good as some, but vastly better than others - and something \"different\" than the norm.\n \nHappy with the food thus far I knew dessert was a must - it was just a matter of deciding on one.  With balsamic strawberries, apple tart tatin, and souffle there were so many options - but clearly the bread pudding stated to be Chef Splichal's signature was the obvious choice.  Beginning with a buttery and rich croissant the dish was bound with a thick vanilla custard and studded with rich chunks of dark chocolate forming pockets within the admixture.  Delicious on its own the square of cake-like pudding was topped with a sweet strawberry and accompanied by a small vessel of buttery bourbon creme that only served to enhance the sweetness of the dish while accenting the subtle notes of the chocolate and vanilla expertly.  While not as \"fancy\" as a souffle, definitely a worthy \"signature\" dessert.\n \nFinishing another glass of water I paid the bill - nearly $50 for lunch - and left a modest tip.  While I fully admit that I'm a bit choosy when it comes to my service there is nothing worse than a chef's vision being compromised by the front of the house.  While the food wasn't as amazing as many places in Vegas and the service could certainly stand to take some lessons from Keller's team at Bouchon I'd consider a return visit in the future if Vegas didn't have so many other great options.\n\nBlog for full review w/ pics.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KJK7ihnpTeHXOy9rxORpGQ"}

A large restaurant with an enormous open kitchen, plenty of seating, and vastly more parking than the grocery I'd heard some mixed things about Chelsea's but with the same high standards of food, service, and setting I really enjoyed my visit - though perhaps not QUITE as much as my frequent stops down the street.\n\nHotcakes:  Having asked my server, Jenna, if I could order the children's hotcakes as a side dish to my main course I was instead offered the option of an individual cake for $2 (as opposed to the children's $6) and happy to take her up on the offer the hotcake turned out to be light, fluffy, and golden brown; perhaps not the most exciting option on the menu but a textbook example of how a pancake should be done - particularly when paired with high quality pure maple syrup.\n\nDixie Pan-Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Vegetables:  The main reason I visited Chelsea's on the day that I did was because I was going to noca for the Fried Chicken showdown that evening - what better way to prepare for fried chicken than with fried chicken?  With that noted, the comparison between the bird from Chelsea's and that of noca, fnb, or any other are a little bit difficult because of the style of preparation, but all things being equal what I really enjoyed about the chicken at Chelsea's was the moisture content of the meat and comparatively light breading overlying the well brined bird.  Crisp and savory with just a bit of spice further enhanced by the peppery potatoes this was down home comfort food - like the hotcakes nothing fancy, just well-made with superior ingredients, though I will say the mashed potatoes and vegetables could have used a bit more salt...and the chicken was even better with a drizzle of the leftover maple syrup from the hotcakes.\n\nRed Velvet Cake with Butter Pecan Gelato from Grateful Spoon and Fresh Mint:  A thick slice of LGO's classic cake served with a scoop of butter pecan gelato from Grateful Spoon and a mint leaf - much like my meal at Lo-Lo's it wouldn't have seemed right to end a breakfast of fried chicken without a slice of red velvet and while I still prefer the version at Lo-Lo's overall it is only by the slimmest of margins and based entirely on a personal preference for a sweeter frosting, something La Grande Orange shies away from, instead focusing on the slightly sour notes to help temper the otherwise dense chocolate cake.  Six of one, half dozen of the other - and the gelato was excellent, though more butter than pecan, and definitely upping the dish's sweetness factor but a significant degree.\n\nA great room and a lovely patio with professional service and fresh, natural, and delicious food I'm sure I'll find myself back a Chelsea's Kitchen soon - but likely not before a good dozen additional visits to the grocery and pizzeria.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3oZcTGb_oDHGwZFiP-7kxQ"}

Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.\n\nSitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.\n\nSeated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.\n\nSeated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.\n\nMoving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of \"The Chop & Chick\" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ntN85eu27C04nwyPa8IHtw"}

Essentially a double shot glass served on a stone the Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam was lovely.  Best eaten with a spoon the liver itself was surprisingly mild and melded perfectly (as expected) with the sweet port.  Topped with a foam lending salinity and levity I found this to be a restrained opening flavor that not only paired well with the champagne, but also gave a glimpse of what was to come.\n\nLE FOIE GRAS en duo m\u00eal\u00e9 de pomme ratte comme un carpaccio aux copeaux de truffe blanche, the dish was described as a carpaccio of foie gras and new potatoes topped with black and white truffle shavings.  A large portion of foie gras and potatoes I'll note that the truffles, though present, played a less prominent role than I'd have hoped.  With chipped parmesan and thin blades of greens and daikon also intertwined in the dish each bite was a new experience - sometimes with the unctuous liver coming to the forefront and at other times with the truffle perfumed potatoes taking center stage.  Though not my favorite dish of the meal, a single bite - foie, daikon, potato, truffle, parmesan - would be the perfect way to describe Robuchon's cuisine...multiple exotic yet restrained flavors coming together to form something entirely original and perfect.\n\nThe next course would be the third of four foie gras dishes for the evening.  Titled LE FOIE GRAS frais de canard cuit au torchon this version would be much more simplistic yet even better than the prior manifestation.  For $36 the traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras was delivered as a torchon accompanied by a dusting of espelette and topped with sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Sourced from the Gascony region of France the Foie was sweeter than I expected, though not artificially so.  Arriving with a plate of grilled country bread I imagine this dish took me ~20-25 minutes to eat as I savored each bite.\n\nLA LANGOUSTINE dans une papillote croustillante au basilica, or Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto featured a single Langoustine, sweet and perfect, wrapped in a leaf of basil and flash fried in a batter so thin it was transparent.  With the slight crackle of the shell giving way to sweet and snappy shellfish the effect was tremendous alone and better with the streaks of citrus and garlic pesto on the plate.  At $22 the price point is certainly not for everyone and if I had to eat Langoustine in Vegas I'd go to Twist first, but I was glad to have experienced this.\n\nL'OEUF cocotte et sa cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re de champignons.  At $19 this is another relatively famous L'Atelier dish.  Featuring a farm fresh egg steamed until barely firm I watched the dish next covered in saut\u00e9ed mushrooms by one chef while another whipped a foamy broth of cream, mushroom broth, and butter which was subsequently poured over the mushrooms.  Finally topped with salt, pepper, and chili powder the final presentation was visual foam with specks of pepper while beneath lied another perfect balance of ingredients.  Smooth and creamy egg, fibrous mushroom, plenty of butter - yet light as a cloud.\n\nThe next course would be a revelation - the sort of dish that on paper seems so simple yet in execution makes you realize why you even go to places like L'Atelier in the first place.  LE RIS DE VEAU clout\u00e9 de laurier frais \u00e0 la feuille de romaine farcie featured a single sweetbread-the largest I've ever seen at nearly the size of a tennis balll - pierced with a bay leaf and pan seared in butter, herbs, and veal jus before being paired on the plate with saut\u00e9ed romaine lettuce in a faintly garlic and dill foam.  At $29 the offal itself cut easily with nothing but a fork and at 5-6 mouthfuls were the best tastes of the meal-almost caramelized on the exterior and creamy within.  A fan of elaborate dishes it is plates like this that remind me just how exquisite simplicity can be when done right.\n\nMy final bites from L'Atelier would be another classic dish and the only one seemingly served at each and every L'Atelier-LA CAILLE au foie gras, caram\u00e9lis\u00e9e avec une pomme pur\u00e9e truff\u00e9e.  At $28 the portion was certainly small, but the impact of the caramelized foie gras stuffed free-range quail with Robuchon's famous truffled-mashed potatoes is undeniable-the whole plate is simply decadence defined.  Somewhat unbalanced compared to the other dishes I will note that the crispy quail was quite mild compared to the creamy liver, but obviously it's not like I mind the flavor of foie gras.  The potatoes - there really isn't anything else that can be said...having had the buttered version last year all I can say is that the truffles make them even better.\n\nOutstanding service and a true experience to watch the kitchen I'd definitely head back for a couple courses regularly if I lived locally, and of course to see what Chef Guechida was doing pastry side.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4uGHPY-OpJN08CabtTAvNg"}

Largely unpopulated given the early hour with choices running the gamut from griddled favorites to gourmet burgers it was in a duo of the former that we invested and with the kitchen exceedingly expeditious given the dearth of additional patrons it would not be long before our breakfast arrived, a pair of Texas Toasts dredged in custard and cornflakes soon bathed in warm syrup sitting beside a four-stack of fluffy flapjacks with a sidecar of boozy bubbling bananas easily justifying the $2.50 surcharge.  Sharing plates as conversation flowed free it would not be long before both stacks of carbs were diminished and with check soon settled it was only as we reached the exit that I noticed the pastry case now full, a collection of cakes and cookies calling out to my substantial sweet tooth with my friend agreeable to further indulge - the end result a chewy yet subtle brownie half-coated by a dark chocolate standing in stark contrast to densely spiced carrot cake finding its foil in tangy cream cheese far less sweet than most.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6BuCNx2gO_GYiXm2KRdMXQ"}

Bringing the signature 7th street delicatessen to a surprisingly small space just off the gaming floor where a few trios and quartets sat basking in the glow of the prior night's escapades behind enormous sandwiches and cauldrons of matzo ball soup it was to friendly service and overhead Sinatra that we arrived and seated immediately orders followed in an equally expedited manner, a total of perhaps nine items ordered but my focus on three plus a half-dozen refills to my cup of coffee.  Speaking first to my favorite 'appetizer,' the $8.50 slice of carrot cake proved competent and not overly sweet, but perhaps as a result of our early morning visit and a cake from last night the crumb delivered slightly dry and under-spiced - the impressive cream cheese icing thankfully buoying the dish, though none of it nearly as impressive as the $13.95 fried cheese blintzes whose light eggy tones and balanced parts savory meets sweet proved excellent on their own, yet far better with house-made applesauce taken bite-for-bite.  Eschewing  meats or omelets, though all looked good, it was in a Jewish deli's Challah that I placed my trust for a 'main course' and with three thick slices soaked in batter, fried golden in butter, and drowned in maple syrup I really could not have asked for more, the stack a veritable bargain at $10.95.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J4qLz0nGzCTMf6-kf_SiQg"}

Slightly underwhelmed by charcuterie selections while the fresh ground peanut butter and a Greek Yogurt Parfait impressed on buffet-plate three the fourth plate was a sinfully sweet quintet with fluffy seasonal pancakes and soft, buttered scones both benefitted by exemplary toppings while the blintzes bested those at Carnegie Deli with lovely autumnal apples and a far less impactful hit to the wallet.  \n\nImpressed moreso than usual by breakfast meats, particularly the candied bacon found on the optional  Bloody Mary Bar, it was expectedly in sweets that the meal called it a wrap and while drinking what might as well have been my twentieth cup of coffee the fresh-made mini donuts were indeed a treat, but not nearly as wowing as the exceptional bread pudding - a traditional preparation with a chocolate surprise at its base that was all the bettered by rich Anglaise, both items something I'd held off on until the very end because I knew that to indulge earlier would compromise my ability to pay due diligence to the rest.\n\nHaving not yet experienced the Sterling Brunch at Bally's, the unlimited champagne feast carrying a tab more than double the price, Veranda is undoubtedly amongst the city's most refined brunch experiences while service never once leaves the diner for want.  Well culled in selection, with items from the menu offered on request, the $40 tab with additional costs for bottomless drinks is a pricey but well justified tally and with strong focus on seasonal ingredients a return visit will undoubtedly take place in the near future - a visit for dinner also on the agenda in order to experience what some have called some of the city's most underrated Italian cuisine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z1KDov5DRTG-rYF_6TyO1A"}

the discount proving most fortuitous in the setting of a restaurant that has the gall to charge $14 for two tiny eggplant rolls and $12 for double espresso of less-than-ideal Lavazza served alongside, not over, ice as if defying one to make a mess in trying to do it themself.\n\nAcknowledging the fact that the first experience at Veranda was coordinated by PR with superlative service from start to finish, suffice it to say that a second meal booked under the name of two friends offered less impressive timing and having ordered substantially with requests for items to be sent out in a rather specific manner the start of the meal was almost inexplicably rushed - the delicious and soft focaccia hitting the table before menus were even opened and both fourteen dollar meatballs and the aforementioned eggplant arriving before a few small bites of brilliantly balanced salad were fully consumed.\n\nTreated next to a pizza that featured a surprisingly buttery crust with little char and rather flavorless tomatoes that thankfully received an upgrade from thickly applied Mozzarella and light accents of basil it would not be long before an onslaught of primi arrived and with the four-top table as well as meager sharing plates obviously overburdened despite our server personally suggesting he would \"space out the pastas\" two of the dishes were immediately sent back to the kitchen - Chef Minichiello obviously taking the gesture seriously by not only coming out to personally apologize, but also individually plating each subsequent course in tasting-menu fashion.\n\nSpeaking specifically to the quality of the noodles, aside from the signature \"jar\" with pasta that logically becomes a bit soft due to the cooking technique, it can only be said that most of Minichiello's housemade creations are served with textbook consistency and with the two meaty courses more 'up front' with the flavors of slow-cooked proteins allowed to shine the flavors of the Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso and Tagliolini were far more restrained, the first melding shellfish and herbs with light cream while the later was an aromatic masterpiece, the saffron and sea beans each offering their unmistakable flavors in balance to sweet, snappy prawns.\n\nPairing a half-chicken cooked Cacciatora-style, with far better results than that at Giada according to my two friends, to two sides that were simple yet impeccably prepared to maximize the flavor of every ingredient it was at this point that each in our party noted that we were becoming quite full and yet with a half-off dessert menu featuring no less than seven items I'd have liked to try it was with some restraint that only three were ordered - the doughnuts a but underwhelming when compared to the buttery seasonal Crostada, but neither even in the same ballpark as the 'signature' in terms of taste or presentation, the cotton-candy topped pedestal featuring soft lady fingers and mascarpone soaked in Amaretto with boozy blueberries and three balls of ice cream making for one heck of a 'sundae.'\n\nTipping on the pre-discount total to the tune of just over $200 for the table it must be said that considering the cost of the meal Veranda presented one of the best dining values on the Strip in this particular circumstance, but taking into account the service gaffs and truly laughable coffee upcharge the question becomes whether yet another visit could be justified at double the price - something I cannot say I'm certain about at this point.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z1KDov5DRTG-rYF_6TyO1A"}

Starting slightly savory before progressing to things far sweeter it was with the duo of three thin Red Velvet pancakes gussied up by tangy cream cheese icing and a custardy masterpiece of a Monte Cristo with fresh strawberry preserves that the meal began and although biscuits and hash browns proved somewhat uninspired as optional sides portions of each proved ample for the price.  Opting next to explore the section entitled \"French Toast and Waffles\" with a pair of the former the plates that arrived would prove even more impressive than round one; both \"breads\" actually sliced cakes dipped in custard and griddled golden, the carrot lacking much vegetable but rich with spice while the tangy poppy seed version served as base to the unbridled flavor of fresh strawberries in a dessert-come-breakfast take on a summertime favorite that should not be missed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DW6SI2KxcfXBHeo9jEr4lQ"}

Greeted pleasantly we were invited to sit wherever we like.\n\nSpeaking of tables and seats, they are probably the first thing anyone visiting Coca Caf\u00e9 will notice.  Somewhere between yard-sale and antique store the restaurant features no less than 20 different styles of chair and everything from a small two top to a table that looks like something you'd find in your grandmother's kitchen.  Lining the wall with works of local artists, many of which were for sale, and filled with natural light the main room is fun and whimsical - so much that you can almost overlook the coffee, juice, and tea bar that dominates the right half of the space.\n\nGreeted quickly by our server, an attractive and smiling young woman named Sharyn we were presented with menus and drink orders were placed - 2 coffees, one Almond Coca Moca and a subsequent hot tea for my sister, plus water.  I will note now that if Sharyn is not an owner or co-owner of Coca Caf\u00e9 she deserves a BIG raise - making lattes, taking orders, bussing tables, running food from the kitchen, rolling napkins and silverware...I wouldn't have been surprised if she was cooking, as well - and even with all that our cups never reached empty.  Inside those cups - bold and balanced La Prima Coffee with free refills for $1.95 and Stash Tea for $1.25...a resounding bargain.\n\nOrders placed we sat for less than fifteen minutes before our shared starter would arrive steaming hot from the kitchen.  Listed as \"Zucchini Bread - made with chocolate chips and coconut, served with fresh fruit\" this was unlike any Zucchini Bread I've ever had in that the bread was certainly made of well chopped zucchini - fibrous, moist, and full of nutmeg and cinnamon - but it was also loaded with shredded coconut and small chips of bitter dark chocolate giving it a \"Mounds Bar\" taste and texture.  Topped with a creamy butter this was a nice taste - it made me want to try the Banana Bread, as well.\n\nWhen it came to main courses we ordered in predictable fashion - each ordering something different and sharing around.  Selecting first my mother, a fan of all things lemon, opted for the Almond French Toast - with fresh berries and lemon cream sauce.  While the dish certainly would not have been my first choice it actually turned out to be superb with thick and hearty rustic French bread cut at an angle, dipped in cream, vanilla, and cinnamon plus chopped almonds and pan fried crispy.  Topped with an ethereal cream sauce that tasted far too sweet to be called \"lemon\" (perhaps Meyer Lemon?) the whole dish felt light, summery, and fun.\n\nFor my sister's selection, the dish I'd originally targeted - Challah French Toast with brie, fig jam, and fresh berries.  Luscious and buttery the Challah on its own would have been delectable, but dipped in batter and griddled to crisp the bread was lovely.  Topping the bread first with heavy slices of creamy brie and then adding a smear of sweet fig compote plus a handful of strawberries and blueberries the dish was already wonderful, but a drizzle of maple syrup really brought out some of the mellow notes in the cheese.\n\nFor my main course, potentially the most interesting item on the menu - the Herbed Goat Cheese French Toast with country white bread stuffed with herbed goat cheese and topped with fresh berries.  Featuring three huge pieces of thick and airy bread, the slices were then cut diagonally and stuffed with rich and pungent chevre laden with basil, chive, salt, pepper.  With a hearty crust supporting the bread and earthy aromatics sandwiched within the bread was then dipped and pan seared to golden brown.  Topped simply with berries the whole concoction begged for a generous helping of pure maple syrup and when completed resembled the sort of sweet/savory interplay that one would expect from an Italian or Greek dessert course.\n\nFull but not stuffed we settled the modest bill and left a well deserved tip for our outstanding \"do-it-all-and-do-it-well\" staff of one.  Making our way to the street and subsequently to Phipps Conservatory the meal at Coca Caf\u00e9 was one of the best breakfasts I've had in some time and everything from the quirky decorations to unique selections to outstanding service were absolutely worth the trip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qMWWQpMiMcV8jz_57cBB0w"}

This one is specific to the menu items within the Pizzeria and will be updated as I try more.  All things being equal, I love this place.\n\nBaked Chicken Wings with Point Reyes Blue Cheese:  From the \"LGO Pizzeria\" menu that begins service at 4pm on weekdays and 11am on weekends it'd be hard for me to imagine a better way to watch football in a public space than at La Grande Orange.  Not a fan of bars, beers, or greasy bites LGO offers up a tasteful menu of traditional American gameday fare highlighted by these $1/ea. seared, seasoned, baked to order wings.  Featuring organic chicken, plenty of heat, and just a bit of char what really sets these wings apart is how plump and juicy they remain even without frying and also the dressing - a sort of \"ranch\" with subtle sourness, lots of chives, and big chunks of bleu cheese throughout.\n\nLGO Pizzeria Pizza - Half Classic Margherita and Half Roasted Corn with Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Corn, roasted tomatoes, and basil:  An interesting pie to say the least, what strikes me most about LGO's pizza is the crust - a sort of sourdough starter that the team is making when the place opens at 6:30am and allowing to rise on the counter as lunch/dinner approaches.  Topped with the superior ingredients that LGO is well known for and slathered with a lot of quality olive oil plus a bit of butter the crust gets a great crunch without getting much char and although the oven isn't hot enough to generate the same blister as Bianco or Pomo (particularly as the bakers are opening/closing it frequently to put new pizzas in and take finished ones out) the structure remains supple with a great chew.  Much more willing to go half/half than the vast majority of high end pizzerias these days I found the Margherita as good as the ingredients, though they went a bit light on the tomatoes for my tastes while the Roasted corn was excellent, the smoky sweetness of the corn proving a perfect foil to the punchy chevre.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7SO_rX1F6rQEl-5s3wZxgQ"}

A meticulous planner, my dinner reservations going into Vegas were mapped out months in advance and my breakfast details planned out extensively.  While my lunches were unscheduled, I generally knew where I wanted to go and generally went there.  When my best friend decided at the last minute that Enoteca San Marco wasn't something he was interested in and suggested \"something asian maybe\" I remembered hearing good things about Sensi and turned to it as an alternative since my buddy had been so agreeable to places like MiX and Alex which weren't really his \"scene.\"  Tucked in the back of Bellagio and pretty tough to find, unfortunately Sensi wasn't tough enough to find.\n\nSeated immediately near the admittedly awesome bread prep station, our 'waiter' Jeremy W briefly asked \"sparkling or flat\" and my friend stated flat.  We were brought an already opened bottle of Fiji and two glasses of ice.  When I suggested tap water would be fine, the 'waiter' stated \"Well, the bottle is already opened.\"  The bottle cost $8 and was not comped despite our not wanting it.  Approximately ten minutes later menus were brought and essentially dropped off without explanation.  The waiter then returned approximately 10 minutes later with some Naan to go with our empty condiments (every other table was served fresh soy, salt, mustard, and tomato pepper chutney with their Naan...I had to stand up and get my own.  Orders were taken and this was the last we'd see of Jeremy until he delivered the bill.\n\nBrowsing the restaurant I must admit the d\u00e9cor was beautiful and watching the chef prepare the Naan was interesting.  After one basket of the delightful and doughy yet crisp bread topped with spicy chutney a non-descript server arrived and removed our basket, later returning with fresh bread.  This was the best service we received at Sensi.  \n\nAfter around 20 minutes our mains arrived, myself ordering Oven Roasted Diver Scallops with Basil Risotto, Zucchini, and Eggplant and my friend opting for the Shrimp and Beef with Duck Fried Rice.  All things being equal, the food was decent but certainly no better than I've had at far cheaper restaurants with vastly better service.  My scallops were a tad overdone but certainly fresh and tasty while the Risotto was soft yet consistent and contrasted well with the vegetables.  My friend additionally noted his dish was \"pretty good.\"  Portion sizes were adequate but certainly not excessive considering the $20+ pricetags.\n\nAnother 15-20 minutes passed after the meal and thankfully I was seated close to the server's station where I was capable of filling my own glass with tap water because during that time no on arrived at our table.  Eventually Jeremy reappeared and without asking about dessert or anything else he delivered the check and collected our dishes.  \"Have a great day\" he said.  To be fair, it wouldn't have taken much to be a great day after such a disappointing meal with such lousy service.  The total bill was $56.03 and our most affordable meal of the trip.  No tip was left as no tip was deserved...I've had better service at Denny's.  \n\nThe only plus of the meal was that on the way back to the sportsbook and gaming floor we had to pass by the beautiful Bellagio gardens and Jean-Philippe where I ordered the best Tiramisu I've ever had.  Moral of the story?  If you're on your way to Sensi just stop, grab some tiramisu and gelato and watch the chocolate fountain.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aYEs_eXqnV8Ifj3Bp0bHwQ"}

One would expect this to be even moreso in Las Vegas.  One would be incorrect.\n\nReservations for the patio overlooking the pirate show were easy on a Thursday night and the crowd was a mixed bag of older rich guys with their wives and younger hipsters wearing True Religion.  Like everywhere else in Vegas, however, it isn't as much about how you look as how you spend.  \n\nSeating was prompt and the servers were quick......too quick, IMO, to suggest the most expensive menu items when my buddy asked for recs.  Admittedly, though, he was knowledgable of the menu and knew how to guide my non-sushi-loving friend to some safe choices.\n\nThroughout the course of the meal we selected and sampled the Tempura shrimp with cold udon and sweet sauce, Unagi Avocado Rolls, Kobe Tartare Roll, Jalapeno Hamachi Tartare, Cracklin Scallops with grilled eggplant, Chocolate Lava Cake, and Mochi.  Each dish was delicious and my friend raved the Kobe roll so much I actually ate beef for the first time in 7 years (what happens in Vegas, I guess.)  Particular standouts were the flawless Scallops and the Cherry Blossom Mochi.\n\nAfter the pirate show (from an AWESOME angle directly behind and w/o the crowd) we made our way out to the bar area, and although not particularly my 'scene' had a great time.  The waitress was friendly (not to mention gorgeous,) the drinks were pricey but tasty, especially the espresso Martini, and the crowd was fun.\n\nAll told, for a \"scenester\" sushi club, the place is nice and the fish is much fresher than most places of the like.  If you're looking for a place with a good view of the strip, some dinner time entertainment, a happening scene afterwards, and decent prices (expected Vegas Markup) for the food quality I'd say Social House might fit the bill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uqisw8IXD5ZutU4MT2MQVw"}

Decidedly different from the Luxe resort-casinos of the southern strip but featuring a gritty sort charm it was just after 5:00am when I arrived at Jerry's and with a skeleton crew catering to just six other patrons in the large space service was expectedly accommodating with coffee kept brimming throughout as a somewhat slow (likely understaffed) kitchen prepared hot dishes allowing me to focus first on pastry - a collection of over fifty options baked in-house featuring cakes, pies, danishes, donuts, and more.  Beginning with the famous \"Strawberry Ring\" it should first be stated that for a choux-based pastry baked at least 8 hours prior to remain crisp and buttery beneath two types of rich cream speaks volumes to the quality of kitchen and with both textures and flavors aplenty the dish proved wonderful, a lightly sweet take on the Paris-Brest with a portion big enough for two or three more than justifying the $6 tab.  Working slowly through the ring with frequent coffee refills as I awaited my sandwich it was with some disappointment that when the Monte Cristo arrived the flavors would only prove average, the fried bread shining while proteins and cheese proved meager in both taste and portion, but propping the dish up with a touch of real maple syrup it should be said that at $1 each, the biscuits at Jerry's are worth seeking out - an excellent rise and good layer separation beneath a crisp, buttered top.  Taking the rest of my order to go, a veritable bargain at $5/slice, suffice it to say that while Jerry's may not be the best choice in town for a sandwich I'd be hard pressed to name a better choice for cake as each of my three selections shined; the anniversary cake a sort of dulce de leche with buttercream and frangipane vying for top billing over a delicate crumb, the bread pudding featuring two layers of rich pound cake topped with lightly sweetened egg custard and a bruleed top, and the carrot cake dense with cinnamon, nutmeg, carrots, raisins, and walnuts beneath thin ribbons of cream cheese frosting - the best I've found in the city to date and a contender for the best I've tasted anywhere in years.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ymbxezwhkf8-8sDWUWOScQ"}

Professional and courteous I will note that service throughout the evening was mostly competent, albeit not overwhelming - a course was delivered without silverware, water reached empty twice, plate clearing was a touch slow.  Fortunately, as part of the Chef's Table experience I had the honor of receiving all of my dishes (and excellent descriptions of preparation and ingredient sourcing) from Chef Chad himself.\n\nShortly after the chef's departure the bread-lady arrived with a woven basket featuring three house-made breads.  Browsing the online list and realizing Eleven takes orders for breads and confections all I can say is that the bread basket gives me a good idea why - all three of the options were excellent.  From a sweet yet toothsome Currant Semolina Sourdough, to a rustic and aromatic Carraway Wheat, to a heavenly moist Sea Salt Focaccia each of the options was excellent...and while my primary server wasn't always on the ball, I was never for want when it came to bread.\n\nThe third course of the evening would provide the first \"wow\" of the tasting - an impressive accomplishment given the simplicity of the dish.  Served proudly and with great description by Chad the House Cured Prosciutto with Three Sisters Mesclun, Vin Cotto, Olive Oil was sublime - the nutty notes of the silky pork only enhanced by the slightly bitter greens, acidic yet sweet vin cotto, and smooth olive oil.  A new passion of the young chef I was even given the opportunity to see the curing area after my meal - a small section of the wine vault with meats aged anywhere from a week to nearly a year - a return visit for charcuterie at the  bar would certainly be on my agenda if I lived locally.\n\nThe final savory of the evening would be my favorite, as well.  Large in portion and bold in flavor, Elysian Field Farms Lamb - Sous Vide with Crispy Lamb Neck, Anson Mills Polenta, Golden Artichoke, and Mint was marvelous.  Nearly raw yet sizzling hot, the lamb itself was not as gamey as would be expected and the crispy wrapping of neck lent plenty of texture and savory flavor.  Acting as a bed to the butter-knife soft lamb was a chive laden and creamy polenta with the slightest hints of mint and mace.  Flanking the protein along with a savory lamb jus were crispy artichoke hearts - pan seared and creamy within, a vegetal composition not unlike the lamb in terms of presentation.\n\nI was next greeted by the pastry chef who presented me a trifecta of her favorite desserts from the menu.  Titled on the menu as \"Tasting\" the trio contained miniature versions of Eleven's Famous Peanut Butter Pretzel Candy Bar, Banana Cream Pie with Tapioca, and Brioche Bread Pudding with Cinnamon and Strawberries.  While I will note I'd have preferred received all three as separate courses (time and temperature reasons only) I will also note that the lady has talent - each option was stunning.  Creamy peanut butter with chocolate ganache and salty pretzels, caramelized bananas with hand whipped cream and graham crackers...and oh the Bread Pudding.  With finger-thick slices of buttery brioche caramelized and doused in a salty cinnamon caramel reduction, the only thing that made it better was the ice cream, a smooth dollop of spicy cinnamon that melted slowly over the hot pudding.\n\nLooking back on dinner at Eleven the word the two words that come to mind are \"American\" and \"Competent.\"  To be fair, in my experience I've never really had a tasting menu that I would call \"American\" without pronounced flourishes of French or Mediterranean - the Chef's table at Eleven was almost like going to CUT or a similar high end steak house and getting a tasting...the food varied from very good to excellent, but certainly did not re-invent the wheel.  For $100 the quality, presentation, and ingredients were certainly worth the price - but at the same time, I can't say I would rush back.  That said, Chad is an excellent Chef with a lot of potential and the space at Eleven is beautiful - I'd certainly go back for some a la carte selections and dessert anytime.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C4GHQTB-G0R2Geov298GLw"}

Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of \"big things in small packages,\" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.\n\nMoving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's \"Signature\" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.\n\nAt this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.\n\nIf there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the \"Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,\" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.\n\nMoving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the \"French Napoleon\" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see \"Mille Feuille New York\") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eTbtfgUtfewdncgVf2CbWw"}

Setting aside high prices and service that would benefit from a few more hands-on-deck, Rao's is a worthy dinner for those seeking rustic red sauce on the Strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_zrSQdISpB_qry9tb098rw"}

Some highlights below.\n\nArriving approximately 15 minutes early at The Palace I made my way to the Augustus Tower and took some pictures before entering the restaurant - doors held open for me by a pair of young ladies and greeted - literally - by Mr. Savoy, a bright smile, and a \"Doctor U. I presume?\"  Somewhat taken aback by such a warm greeting I confirmed my name and shook the managers hand before being escorted to my table in the main dining room.\n\nWith my menu presented and myself settled in for a great experience the meal began with a pair of Canapes - both signature trademarks of Guy Savoy's restaurant both here and overseas.  The first dish, entitled \"French club\" consisted of alternating layers of duck foie gras, truffles, and brioche - now that is how you start a meal.  No bigger than the distal part of my thumb the dish was excellent with the buttery bread and earthy truffle providing the first flavor and fragrance but later giving way to the intensely creamy foie gras that lingered on the palate it its signature manner.  Without trying to sound too gluttonous I could've (and would've) eaten at least 50 of these given the chance.  \n\nKicking off the official portion of the tasting menu I was brought a dish entitled Mosaic of Milk Fed Poularde, Foie Gras, Artichoke with Black Truffle Jus (Bread pairing Toasted Country Bread.)  Featuring layers of pounded and roasted chicken that was on par with the version at The French Laundy interspersed with creamy and unctuous moularde duck foie gras and a pureed artichoke the dish was one of the best mixed terrines I've ever tasted with the creamy foie, savory chicken, and smooth artichoke each standing separate yet also blending effortlessly to form a uniform taste that somewhat resembled mushroom - all of this was of course brought to an even more potent effect by the addition of a salty and earthy jus that tasted like the very essence of a black truffle and clung to the palate.  Pairing well with the warmed bread I spread each bite thin and savored this dish a great deal.\n\nExtremely happy with the meal thus far I was next greeted by one of Monsieur Savoy's most famous dishes - the Colors of Caviar (Bread pairing Plain Ciabatta.)  A multilayered \"parfait\" of sorts this dish was described at length but essentially consisted of multiple layers of caviar - a chilled caviar creme, a hot egg caviar sabayon, a caviar gelee, a smooth and salty green bean puree,  and a thick layer of cool Ossetra egg - eaten with a mother of pearl spoon.  Instructed to eat bites of each layer all at once I dug into the dish slowly and let the amalgam dissolve slowly in my mouth; unreal.  While I cannot say what the exact overarching flavor of the dish was, the feel of the dish was tremendous with a progression of flavors, textures, temperatures, and densities - a true \"study\" of the food.  Interestingly because of its presentation each bite actually offered a different sensation and progression due to the way the concoction came out on the spoon.  At $90 (off menu price) this is the most expensive single dish I've ever tasted and had it not been on the menu I'd likely not have indulged - but I'm certainly glad I did.  The bread served with this dish was clearly meant to do nothing but allow the caviar to shine - a plain and boring ciabatta that I tasted and discarded the rest of.\n\nDiverting from the classics to something I love the next dish was Radis-Foie, or Foie-Gras \"en Papillote\" and Radish Bouillon (Bread pairing Caramelized Onion Ciabatta.)  Having had my first truly amazing cooked Foie a few weeks earlier at Blackbird (a roasted prep) and L2O (first seared then roasted and served in a cotton candy shell) I was very intrigued by this dish and its novel method of preparation - first seared and then cooked not-exactly \"en Papillote\" or parchment, but rather steamed in sherry vinegar with pink and white radishes in a plastic bag which is presented tableside before being opened up and returned to the kitchen for plating.  Shying away from traditional accoutrements like fruit and nuts the kitchen at Guy Savoy instead chooses to temper their foie with bitter as opposed to sweet utilizing the bitter radish leafs and mild yet spicy radishes to further balance the foie's characteristic unctuous and buttery body.  While I personally love the majority of sweet Foie Gras preparations I've experienced I have to say this prep was an eye opener for me and a true showing of Guy's brilliance.  Speaking later with the Chef du cuisine during my tour of the kitchen it was actually this dish that garnered the majority of our discussion - apparently the use of bitters and spices to temper the liver is much more commonplace in France and Italy than in the United States due to their larger consumption of the dish and \"American's have a sweet tooth.\"  While I'll not argue with my love of sweets I will say that this dish is one of the best Foie Gras preps I've had.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gVYju3XRcO1R4aNk7SZJcA"}

Surely one of the more trendy Mina properties, lodged in Mandalay Bay with high ceilings, slick design, and plenty of polish to compliment the thumping music it was just moments before our 7:00pm reservation that we presented to the hostess stand and quickly whisked to a table along the back wall it was with ample pleasantries that we were greeted, a trio of $15 cocktails to compliment the duck fat fries soon in hand but something immediately awry as the area's temperature trumped eighty degrees - a trend to continue for the next two hours despite repeated complaints and the apparent efforts of restaurant manager Ashley to contact maintenance as beads of sweat rolled down our brows.  Suffering largely in silence so as not to disrupt the celebration but clearly uncomfortable it would not be long after seating that our five-course menu would commence and wanting for a truly grand experience each round of food arrived as a trio, items including the \"Instant Bacon,\" Bone Marrow, Spinach Souffle, and Wagyu vs. Wagyu truly exemplary while the foie gras, chicken, and halibut were inexplicably overcooked to the point where the first two were nearly inedible while the later - a gift from the kitchen - was saved only by its aromatic sauce.

An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of cr\u00e8me anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the cr\u00e8me, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WNy1uzcmm_UHmTyR--o5IA"}

Starting first with a $3.24 Almond Croissant it would be hard to imagine something more doughy and less crisp coming from 7-Eleven and moving right along to a $2.50 White Chocolate Raspberry Macaron with decent crackle yielding gummy crumb and sweet 'frosting' of a non-descript flavor I sat and wondered exactly what was going on; a brief reprieve found in admirable, albeit microwave-heated bread pudding drizzled in light caramel.  At this point sitting with half a macaron and 2/3 of the croissant unfinished it was last, and certainly least that I moved to the 'nutellamisu\" and while certainly not the prettiest presentation nothing could have prepared me for the taste - an acrid, sour, and questionably spoiled cream cheese 'pudding' debauchery of the Italian classic that tasted nothing of Nutella or Tiramisu, a second bite of the $3.95 cup yielding similar results and landing it plus the remaining pastries in the trash as I left the store thankful I'd not yet finished my coffee so as to cleanse my palate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pt5AYjhzoU93biVeVahLKw"}

A great meal is a kind of journey that returns you to sources of pleasure you may have forgotten and takes you to places you haven't been before.\" \n\nWith quotes like that you know his food is not a joke, and I will admit a bias to Thomas Keller's concepts and food.  From peanut butter and jelly to quiche to gnocchi to bread and butter to cookies and cakes the man simply does amazing things with food.  The best french toast I've ever eaten, the best quiche, the best cookie....and service that never fails to make you feel like the most important guest on earth.  With those things in mind my Vegas vacation entailed two visits to Bouchon Bistro and four visits to Bouchon Bakery for mid-day snacks.\n\nOn day one, selections after lunch entailed a Red Velvet Cupcake and Keller's seasonal bread pudding.  Consumed in the Venezia Gardens/Pool area outside Bouchon Bistro, I can definitely say the cupcake was the best Red Velvet I've ever consumed.  Creamy cream cheese and creme fraiche frosting with a hint of cocoa served over (and throughout) a moist and delectable cake with strong hints of cinnamon and chocolate, plus the earthy taste of the beat sugar used for sweetness and color....sublime.  Better than Crumbs, Beasley, Yummy, Sprinkles, and even Doughboy's famous version.  Even better than Piece of Cake in Columbus, my previous favorite.  After the cupcake I shopped Vegas for a bit and then ate the Bread Pudding rewarmed in the hotel microwave.  Sweet but savory, dense yet not \"wet,\" and loaded with cranberry, raisin, and white raisin....awesome.  Not as good as the french toast version at Bouchon Bistro, but in my top 5 Bread Puddings, for sure.\n\nDay two selections, after breakfast at Bouchon, entailed two beignets and a Macaroon.  A flawless Coffee Macaroon was first and was just as flawless as the Caramel one in New York in June.  Airy, crisp, sweet, and flavorful.  Not as good as the Macaroons at Pistacia Vera, but close, and much larger.  The Beignets selected were small filled donuts stuffed with Vanilla Custard and Raspberry jam.  Both were light and flavorful, still warm, and the fillings were potent without being overpowering of the buttery beignets.  Personally I enjoyed the unfilled \nBeignets at Bouchon Bistro better, but these certainly best Dunkin, Krispy Kreme, Bob's, or other \"donut\" shoppes.\n\nDay three, stuffed after dinner before and planning for Alex in the evening, a single Carrot Cake Sandwich Cookie was chosen.  As good as the Cupcake and Bread Pudding were, this was the \"bar raiser\" in terms of wow factor.  Having had the TKO and Nutter Butter while in NYC, I really didn't think cookies could get better.  WRONG!  I like Carrot Cake and I've had some good ones, but this thing was surreal.  Smaller than a hockey puck it literally weighed approximately 8oz and was absolutely loaded with the fibrous texture of carrots, yet perfectly balanced and soft like a cake.  Hints of cinnamon and vanilla plus the subtle taste of pineapple in the frosting....I wish this recipe were in the Bouchon Cookbook.  Actually...why doesn't Keller share the recipes for all three cookies in his next book?\n\nDay four, after brunch at Bouchon with the transcendent French Toast and unfilled beignets, I opted for a single Banana Nut Muffin which I consumed with the coffee at the Palazzo sportsbook while watching Terrell Pryor ascend to king of Columbus back home.  After consuming the muffin I only wished Keller would take Bouchon Bakery nationwide so I could consume all of these things back home.  Weighing in at likely a pound, the texture was on par with the carrot cake and the flavor equally subtle yet fantastic.  Sticky sweet, topped with a cinnamon crumble, and \nperfectly moist....I was sad that some of it stuck to the paper, despite being overly full.\n\nBetween Alex, Le Cirque, MiX, Craftsteak, Bouchon, and so many other highly regarded restaurants in Vegas I definitively had a GREAT culinary trip....my only regret is that I didn't have more room in my stomach.  If I had, I'd have certainly filled it with more goods from Bouchon.

Next you check out of the castle, stow your bags at the Venetian (home for the next 3 days) - time for some Bouchon bakery!\n\nHaving been to each of Keller's three wonderful bakeries in the past year (along with both Bouchons, The French Laundry,and Ad Hoc) I - the guy who doesn't regularly \"repeat\" in vacation cities - knew that a stop or two at the bakery and a visit to Bouchon itself would definitely be on the docket for this trip to Vegas.  Arriving around 7:15am and checking out the fresh selection I must admit I was a little disappointed that so few new choices existed from last year - everything from the macarons to the cupcakes to the \u00e9clairs were the same.  Waiting in the short line and browsing the items I eventually settled on a couple of choices knowing I'd be back later to pick up macarons for my mother anyhow.\n\nStarting first with the Cinnamon Brioche I have to say that this was the first time a Bouchon item ever let me down.  Served as a sort of \"pull-apart\" the cinnamon speckled bun was quite expensive at $4.50 and it honestly tasted like it may have been left over from the day before.  Appropriately buttery but relatively dry the bread tasted more of a dinner roll than a true brioche and the cinnamon was largely lost on my palate.  Furthering my opinion that I'd been hoodwinked on a day-old, the center piece was actually much better and more moist than the outer ring - evidence of \"drying out\" perhaps.\n\nThe second selection was the saving grace of the visit - a luscious strawberry croissant that was almost as much a coffee cake as a true croissant.  Featuring the wonderfully buttery French pastry that I sampled on last visit (with chocolate and almonds) the inside of the flaky pastry was this time filled with sliced fresh strawberries while the bottom of the croissant was covered with a cinnamon and butter crumble.  Crisp shell and soft interior - buttery, tart, fresh, excellent.\n\nWhile I admit that this visit wasn't as wonderful as previous experiences with Bouchon Bakery, the service was still excellent and when I returned the day before leaving for home to purchase the macarons they actually did a wonderful job in packaging the cookies for the long flight home.  Selecting Strawberry, Lemon, and Orange my mom stated that the brown/green box was her favorite souvenir from this as well as many of my previous trips.  Can't really argue with that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "50nln4YPr0QDo_v1uBmHfg"}

Like my previous stays in Vegas this vacation would be no different - except this time the offerings featured a holiday appropriate theme.  Visiting the bakery four times during out five days in Vegas many repeats were ordered and all remained as excellent as prior - the Carrot Cake cookie, the Nutter Butter, the Red Velvet Cupcake, the Pistachio Macaron, and the Pain au Chocolate to name a few.  Focusing my own ordering on new items and holiday themed selections I managed to sample six new items during the various visits.\n\nBeginning first with the croissant of the month, December featured Dutch Apple.  While I personally feel that \"croissant\" is a bit of a misnomer for such a dense pastry, the dough was unmistakably the same - the difference was the presentation.  Essentially a hemi-sected butter croissant topped with cinnamon roasted apples and buttery strudel topping the flavor was that of apple crisp in a warm and portable form.\n\nMoving on to the holiday items, my first would be the Christmas Tree TKO.  For those unfamiliar with Keller's famous take on the Oreo, the recipe is out there and the cookie is divine.  This time cut into the shape of a Christmas tree and filled with a mint chocolate cream I personally fancy the original more so as I find mint to be overpowering.  On the contrary, however, my mother loved this cookie and ended up with two in her luggage in addition to the two she ate while in Vegas.\n\nAnother holiday special featured a frosted shortbread snowflake.  At a cost of $4.50 the palm-sized cookie likely weighed in at nearly 8 ounces and if I had to guess the cost was almost entirely based on the full stick of butter included.  Dense and crisp, the cookie quite literally melted in the mouth leaving behind a sweet buttery memory.  Not for the faint of heart (or high in cholesterol) a single cookie was almost \"too much,\" but thankfully there was a group of four to split the pair we ordered.\n\nThe gingerbread man (and accompanying woman) were a bit of a letdown in my personal opinion.  Lightly frosted and quite thin the cookies were hefty in cinnamon and sweetness, but rather lacking in the characteristic gingerbread flavor.\n\nA fan of all things mint and equally of macarons, the Peppermint Macaron was a no-brainer for my mother.  For those unfamiliar with Bouchon's style of Macaron, they are approximately the size of an adult male palm and when fresh they are every bit on par with the best I've tasted in the United States.  A shining example, the peppermint variation featured the characteristic crackling shell which gave way to the soft and supple cookie within.  Filled with a cocoa accented peppermint ganache I know some folks contest that Bouchon's macarons are too sweet and while I'll fully admit this was the sweetest I've tasted, the flavor was akin to a York Peppermint Patty in cookie form - it was delicious.\n\nThe final selection of our visits to Bouchon Bakery would be the Chocolate Bouche de Noel.  Served as a 1.5 inch thick slice of the \"log\" and garnished with meringue mushrooms and cocoa covered almond stones, the chocolate G\u00e9noise was rolled and frosted with chocolate buttercream and lightly dusted with confectioner's sugar snow.  Dense and filling I was glad I ordered coffee with the cake while my companions contested this was the sort of dish best enjoyed with milk.\n\nRarely one to revisit the same spot multiple times at all let alone on the same visit I will continue to frequent Bouchon and Bouchon Bakery whenever I have the chance - like when I visited the Beverly Hills location on December 22nd and the Vegas location for Christmas brunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "50nln4YPr0QDo_v1uBmHfg"}

When the waiter arrived to refill his water and asked if he could get the check the man pulled out a money clip, peeled off two $100 bills and said \"that should cover it\" before getting up and walking away...the man had ordered a fruit plate. Tucked away in the gardens and pools of the Wynn Tableau is both rich and beautiful in appearance, much like its patrons. Sure I didn't expect low quality from Steve Wynn, but to say the clientele of Tableau was \"well to do\" would be a vast understatement.\n\nArriving at 7:45am I was greeted by the gorgeous lobby and the gracious hostess who asked whether I would prefer dining indoors or on the patio. As the patio was amply shaded and most of the patrons were outside I chose the patio and was subsequently offered a copy of the Wallstreet Journal, New York Times, or USA Today to browse. Seeing the headlines regarding the USC upset, I opted for the USA Today (clearly indicating my status compared to the rest of the diners who sat browsing the Times or Journal) and chose a wonderful table half sunny/half shaded with a great view of the pool and gardens. Water was filled and the menu was delivered while the waiter went to get my coffee.\n\nBrowsing the menu I was instantly captured by the pastry basket and the Peach pancakes, but not being hungry enough for both decided to ask the waiter what was available in the basket. Approximately 10 items were rattled off including an apricot tart, apple scone, and nectarine turnover. When I asked if pastries could be ordered individually it was explained that these were 'petite' pastries and if I wanted to try only one it would be free of charge. \"A nectarine turnover and the peach pancakes, please.\" \"Certainly, sir.\"\n\nWhile I waited for my food I stood up and roamed the pools and gardens. Approximately 20 people were present at the time, all dressed either business casual or semi-formal and all dining on items ranging from the freshest appearing fruits to pastries to eggs and sausage that looked incredible. When I returned to my table (my tableau?) my coffee was waiting along with cream and sugar/spelda/equal. No nutrasweet was to be seen and when asked I was informed \"Mr Wynn does not fancy nutrasweet.\" Fair enough (for what it is worth, Alex also didn't have Nutrasweet but noted they could obtain it immediately if I desired.)\n\nAfter approximately 10 minutes a fantastic yet dainty apricot turnover arrived fresh from the oven. Crispy, flaky, loaded with fresh nectarines it was the perfect opener to the meal and I'd have certainly enjoyed many more had I ordered the basket. Another 10 minutes and a laugh at the Trojans passed, my coffee was refilled once, and then my pancakes emerged from the kitchen.\n\nDescribed in the menu as Ricotta Peach Pancakes with lime butter and organic maple syrup, nothing could've prepared me for these pancakes. Fluffy and light, airy yet moist, sweet yet savory and absolutely jammed with fresh skinned peaches, the dish was presented with a simple dusting of powdered sugar, a side-pitcher of warm syrup, and a dollop on the side that tasted like a fresh key lime dissolved in butter. Having tried Ricotta Pancakes only once before but any number of stellar pancakes in the past, this dish was a revolution and I truly sat and savored each bite. Sure, $14 for three pancakes is not a bargain, but $14 for breakfast bliss? That is a bargain.\n\nWhen I finished my pancakes and resisted the urge to lick my plate clean my waiter arrived and asked if he could get me anything else. \"Perhaps a coffee to go?\" \"....don't twist my arm....how about another turnover too?\" \"Certainly, sir.\" While I didn't tip $185 like my neighbor, I certainly wish I could have.\n\nOn my way out everyone was very friendly, from the other waiters to the hostess, making each guest feel like their visit was truly valued. I was even invited to return for dinner, but when I told the hostess we had reservations for Alex that evening she noted \"oh, excellent choice, perhaps some other time.\" All told the meal was fantastic and on par with Bouchon in terms of quality, presentation, and service. Go early, sit on the patio, eat, smile, and enjoy the richness of the food and the clientele...even if you yourself aren't rich...sometimes it's fun to see how the upper crust lives.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vEeiIvhzz29rO-6EPFqkjQ"}

With noise moderate and the front-of-house surprisingly smiley and professional yet whimsical and conversant from the moment we arrived I knew we would be in good hands (but little did I know HOW good.)\n\nSeated at a comfortable four-top it would be mere moments after seating that our captain would greet us and after confirming water choices we were presented with a wine list and menus while the a la carte vs. 4/5/6 course tasting menu option was explained.  With my co-diners having never experienced such a place and with many of the items on the menu rather novel to them we were left to decide and largely allowing them to dictate the pace we settled on the five course tasting...or so we thought as what followed would actually be a twenty-seven \"course\" three hour and forty five minute rollercoaster ride through the imagination of Chef Binkley and his team.\n\nA few highlight dishes:\n\nBrioche Cinnamon Doughnuts with Bacon Butter:  piping hot and minimally greasy they were peerless, particularly when smeared with the umami-savory flavors of hickory smoked bacon.\n\n\"Deep Fried Butter\" with Lobster Cream Cheese and Lobster Roe Powder, Chef Binkley's take on Lobster Bisque created by dropping a butter cube into the fryer and subsequently injecting it with the cream cheese before dusting it with roe.  Sweet, creamy, intense and just like the sloppy joe a faithful recreation of the chef's intention...if this were served at the bar I'd go and order a dozen.\n\nFoie Gras Beignets with White Truffle Cream and Foie Gras Vanilla Milk Shake with Blackberry Swirl and Blackberry Whipped Cream.\"  Beginning first with the light balls of dough, each with a wispy crumb studded with whole cubes of duck liver torchon these bites were superlative on their own but even more so with the slightly sweet and ethereally aromatic cream.  Taking a bite and then moving to the shake...yes, it was absolutely as good as it sounds - a smooth blend of blackberries and heavy cream with the gossamer of the liver always present yet slightly out of reach.\n\nEntitled \"Crispy seared Foie Gras with apple, raisins, pomegranate, spiced Brazil nuts, popover, chervil\" and finished tableside with a spritz (literally from a spritzer) of cinnamon Ice Wine vinegar this preparation of duck liver would arrive as a linear stripe on a square plate and harkening the plating style of Michael Carlson the flavors would also compare favorably as the crackling exterior of the foie gave way to the melting interior and each bite lent itself to a new form of explanation with the accoutrements - most sweet, many smooth, and all interesting; particularly the popover stuffed with a creamy puree of liver, nuts, and aromatic spices.\n\nFor the next intermezzo all I can call it is a tease - a bit of dining refinement between novelty desserts that absolutely wowed - a two-bite Peanut Butter Souffle with Raspberry Jam every bit as \"souffl\u00e9\" as the sloppy joe was its namesake and along with the foie gras beignet perhaps my favorite bites of a great meal.  Really - if this was offered on the menu I'd have ordered a full sized one in a heartbeat.\n\nIn the end Binkley's is a place that no matter where it was located would be special and a place that I'll undoubtedly return to with frequency if my career path should indeed land me in the desert long term.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yJMLD-6AggZNdC-GonVBsA"}

Clearly influenced by his famous space on Waverly Place, both in design and in offerings, but differing slightly in vibe as a dimly lit room with R.E.M. playing gently overhead was complimented by lovely service from a young woman named Kelly our meal began with the staple-amuse of tender, spiced chickpeas on crisp bread and with proper bread service replenished frequently thereafter not a single bite of the food that followed would prove short of exemplary.  Eschewing lighter 'spring' flavors in favor of signatures until later in the meal our first course arrived with creamy pate of pork delivering plenty of spice and sapor while tender tripe compensated for its small portion with textbook texture and complex aromatics - a trend carried over to each $26 plate of pasta; the raviolis averaging approximately $4 each but so delicate, stuffed, and well sauced that it hardly seemed to matter until the plate was wiped spotless with plans to return for the pasta tasting menu swirling my mind.  Transitioning smoothly to things more substantial it would be an exercise in futility to determine whether the rich, caramelized-yet-rare spring lamb over smoky artichoke puree or the nutty roulade of rabbit with flan of carrots was a superior secondi and finishing with dessert both the simple peach presentation and an atypical souffl\u00e9-style budino showed the pastry kitchen's prowess - a Babboesque box of petit fours and a double espresso sending us to theater with full bellies and broad smiles.\n\nObviously prone to complaints of discrepancy in price-to-portion ratio for \"Italian food\" that many claim to be offered at a better value from their local mom n' pop joint a meal at B&B Ristorante is better taken as a \"Fine dining\" event rather than any regional cuisine - not only does the sourcing, preparation, and presentation deserve it but so does the service.  Certainly not a cheap meal as the average diner is unlikely to exit for less than a Benjamin suffice it to say that for a 'celebrity chef' meal on The Strip B&B delivers where many mail it in, a similar sentiment applicable to Palazzo's Carnevino, though the latter is ever so slightly a better 'experience.'", "type": "review", "business_id": "rNahhyqDlouyDMHh57p3ug"}

Obviously not brought up on \"Soul Food\" but raised close enough to Detroit that it played a big part in childhood memories I've since sought out, those looking for collards, chitlins, or gumbo should be aware that none are available before noon on weekends (despite the online annotated 11am,) nor is fried chicken beyond the wing (though if you ask nicely they may be able to accommodate after a substantial delay...IE, the thigh arrived with dessert,)  and moving past these inconveniences be advised that service, while friendly, is constrained - a pair of young ladies and an elderly fellow managing a capacity crowd of ~80 with wait times up to an hour during my stay.  Moving past the 'issues' and onto the food and d\u00e9cor suffice it to say that the interior replicates the fa\u00e7ade and with a small kitchen at work behind makeshift walls the food arrived at an awkward pace with mixed results, particularly in the proteins where both pork chop and breast were dry and flavorless despite excellent, crispy breading while the thigh was expectedly more succulent but also far better seasoned, as if from an entirely different batch.  Speaking to the rest, mostly carbs and a pair of over easy eggs, it was in these items that M&M shined - the waffles a soft wheat batter and the 'cornbread' a pair of pan fried flapjacks needing only a touch of syrup to balance the savory notes, something neither the sweet potato pie nor the banana pudding would require at all - the former a well done classic and the second far more dense than any take on the dish I've found and all the better for it, a sort of bread pudding made with only a bit of liquid and a lot of ripe bananas juxtaposing softened nilla wafers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JUATTlFUONx_er9_YRFDrw"}

With days jammed packed this short trip would actually prove to be a little tricky in planning but after getting a general feel for the local logistics the restaurants fell into place nicely with breakfast, lunch, and dinner planned strategically each day along with a few snacks.  Beginning first with breakfast, just as my trip did, there were three proper sit down breakfasts in The Valley and the first took place less than an hour after I hopped of the plane at The Farm at South Mountain.\n\nWith bags packed light and my car easily obtained the drive to Morning Glory Caf\u00e9 would be a straight forward 15 minutes from Sky Harbor Airport and arriving at the large farm I proceeded down the gravel path through gardens of streaming sunlight that I quite simply did not expect to see in the \"desert.\"  With signs delineating the location of the caf\u00e9 (and the oft raved Quiescence next door) parking was found under a shady tree and checking the thermostat, 87 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:45am) I hopped out of the car and walked down the path to the restaurant only to find the patio approximately 1/3 full.  Greeted promptly by a thin young woman and subsequently by the elderly gentleman who would be my server I was told to \"sit anywhere you like.\"\n\nSelecting a seat in the shade as my pale Midwestern complexion certainly was not ready for an hour in the Arizona sun it would be mere moments before Cliff would stop by with the menu and a bucket of condiments to inform me of the daily pastry special and to ask if I had any questions.  Requesting a coffee I was informed that the coffee, water, and tea are all \"help yourself\" and suggesting I'd need a minute to browse the menu I was told to take my time.  \n\nWith the menu concise but full of excellent choices largely consisting of locally sourced meats and organic produce I spent a few moments weighing my decision and with my choices made I motioned to Cliff who stopped by to take my order and warn me \"you'd better be hungry\" before departing for the kitchen.  Undeterred by his warning I next proceeded to the coffee stand where biodegradable cups and lids were provided for both water and coffee and after getting a cup of each I returned to my seat where I sipped the thin and mildly acidic locally roasted Caf\u00e9 Cortez coffee while awaiting my appetizer.\n\nPrebaked but still warm, the first item to arrive at my table would be the pastry of the day - a Blueberry Muffin nearly the size of my fist and bespeckled with crystals of cane sugar.  First tasting the muffin as it was and then gilding the proverbial lily with salted California Dairies butter the muffin would prove to be quite impressive in its density but also in its fluffiness as the medium-size blueberries burst with flavor within the buttermilk batter with tinges of cinnamon tickling the palate.\n\nWith coffee refilled and a short wait as the patio filled another pair of tables with locals (and regulars judging by the greeting) Cliff would arrive perhaps twenty minutes after I was seated with the main course - the \"Farm Monte Cristo\" consisting of two thick slices of fluffy rustic French Toast sandwiched around slow baked local ham, two over easy eggs, and melting cheddar cheese.  Apparently expecting me to be overwhelmed by the size Cliff offered me a \"good luck and bon appetite\" before stepping away and with that I set out to douse the amalgam with warm organic maple syrup and take a bite; a bite that more or less redefined the Monte Cristo for all time as the bread was not the least bit oily but rather light and fluffy with a nearly croissant textured interior and slight yeasty notes mellowed by the syrup and the powdered sugar. Moving next to the ham-young, fresh, lean, and salty - and then the sharp cheddar and creamy eggs the flavor was in a word \"perfect;\" salty, sweet, creamy, crunchy, and at the same time surprisingly light.  It was not only the best breakfast item I had in Phoenix, but the best sandwich I've had in a very long time.\n\nWith Cliff returning surprised that I'd finished the meal and offering me a \"good job\" I joked (well, not really joked as I really did go for pastry and pizza afterward) that the sandwich \"wasn't that big, but it was THAT good\" and thanking him for the service I requested the tab while getting yet another coffee to enjoy while I checked my mail and another cup to go.  Noting now that the experience of such a great sandwich, setting, and service is not \"cheap\" ($23 with tax and tip) I can say without a doubt that if I do end up in Phoenix long term Cliff will not make the mistake of underestimating my capacity again because without a doubt I'll be a regular.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9yKzy9PApeiPPOUJEtnvkg"}

Obviously prone to over-ordering, particularly in small groups, our trio next doubled down on a pair of pies and while the thin white pie proved somewhat bland to my tastes with a mundane crust tinged with semolina the Sicilian dazzled as fresh mozzarella formed soft puddles amidst aromatic tomato sauce bright with acid and appropriately devoid of sugar.

Barely spicy with hints of tomato and basil, the texture was like a creamy tuna salad without the mayo.\n\nDish 1:  KAMPACHI SASHIMI, GREEN CURRY EMULSION, SEAWEED SALAD - Perfect Kampachi with a fairly mild flavor, yet delectably enhanced by the green curry this dish was quite attractive and a good followup to the tuna.  As good as the fish was, however, the seaweed salad was incredible and my only complaint could possibly be that there wasn't ten times as much.  Then again, had I known how much food was to come I'd have known better.\n\nDish 2:  TENDER POTATO GNOCCHI, FRESH MORELS & ASPARAGUS WITH VEAL JUICE AND FLAKED PARMESAGNA - Knowing my feelings about Gnocchi, this dish was a part of the reason I'd selected MiX in the first place.  Unlike Thomas Keller's buttery Parisian version, Ducasse opts here to utilize the Italian formula of simple and tender potato dumplings with just a little salt and complements from the dense and woody flavor of perfectly tender Morels and flawlessly crisp asparagus.  The veal juice and parmesagna added a salty and savory component to the dish.  While not the best gnocchi ever, the texture and flavor were sublime and I'd certainly re-order on return visits.\n\nDish 3:  MACADAMIA/PISTACHIO CRUSTED HALIBUT, ASPARAGUS CREAM, PARMESAN FOAM - The show stealer for my friend and a solid frontrunner for best-fish-dish-ever for myself, it is hard to describe the delicate nuisances of this dish without experiencing it.  Perfectly poached fish with a crunchy yet sweet and nutty coating bisected a plate with asparagus and creamy asparagus cream on one side and a cheesy foam on the other side.  While each flavor was superb separately, the combination was even more stunning with the cream and foam drizzled over the fish.  A second dish featuring asparagus and parmesan, it is easy to see why Ducasse serves these two dishes back to back frequently and I cannot recommend the combination enough.  In a weekend that featured tasting menu fish preparations by Le Cirque and Alex as well, this may have been the best fish dish of all, and that is saying something.\n\nDish 4:  ROASTED MAINE LOBSTER \"AU CURRY\", COCONUT BASMATI RICE, PINEAPPLE, RAISIN, AND PEARL ONIONS - Quite frankly I've no idea what Ducasse was thinking when he prepared this dish the first time, but the thought it was certainly inspired by a muse or a God.  To be fair, the curry was understated so anyone ordering this for heat will be disappointed.....I didn't order for heat.  What I ordered it for was a fantastically prepared lobster served over sweet sticky rice and complimented by roasted onions and sweet fruits.  While not quite as mind-blowing as the Lobster at Alex (which may be my favorite dish of all time,) this is the second best Lobster preparation I've ever experienced and it will haunt my dreams until I find a means to prepare it myself.\n\nDish 5:  ROASTED DUCK BREAST, BLACK MISSION FIG, RADISH & BABY TURNIPS, FIG SAUCE - My first substitution and absolutely worth the choice.  A well cooked yet juicy duck breast, skin on and perforated for complete cooking, the meat was not gamey at all and the earthy/meaty texture was wonderfully offset by the figs and fig sauce, yet given a crispy textural component by the radish and turnips.  While the \"worst\" of the dishes in my opinion, the competition was pretty stiff and that is no disrespect at all.   \n\nPalate Cleanser:  PASSIONFRUIT AND MANGO SORBET WITH COCONUT LIME FOAM - Served in a Martini glass, I believe the phrase palate cleanser was invented for this dish.  I don't even like Mango and this item impressed me.  \n\nDessert:  BABA AU RHUM, MONTE CARLO STYLE WITH SPICED RUM AND CR\u00c8ME ANGLAIS - While I'm not a drinker, I am a fan of rum cake and rank Mastro's Buttercake amongst my all time favorite desserts.  A small cake was served along with a pot of rum and a second pot of cr\u00e8me which was then reconstructed by the waiter tableside, first pouring a little rum and then a dollop of cream with further customization allowed.  While not QUITE as good as Mastros, the dish was a beautiful compliment to the meal and left a warm feeling in my belly for the rest of the night.\n\nMadelines :  To cap off the meal we were served four of Ducasse's signature Madelines straight from the piping hot pan along with warm Nutella.  While I realize the tradition of the Madeline has been carried on by both Stratta and Boulud, it is my understanding that Ducasse was first and though I've not tried Daniel's, Ducasse's option blew Alex's out of the water.  Moist, creamy, delicate, and perfect with the Nutella.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pz7SWZQhxL6ZbhL9jE2NTA"}

Chuckling at this price and suggesting I'd look elsewhere it was with little surprise that the clerk sprang to action suggesting a \"special\" price of $25 without consulting her boss - an obvious indication that the former price was based on the label more than the workload and plenty of incentive for me to walk out, taking my business elsewhere.\n\nAdmittedly noting that their selection of shoe care products is on par with some of the higher end locations in the city it seems reasonable to assume that the quality of worksmanship is high but never one to support shady business practices I can't say I'm in any rush to affirm the veracity of that assumption.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YDdKrsv8nS6bY5DqcHLvNA"}

No pits, no stems, soft flesh and crispness to the skin - all told, excellent.\n\nWaiting only a short time my next arrival was the salad - or at least the dish listed as a salad.  Entitled Due Uova the plate was certainly overpriced at $14 but the taste/flavor certainly made up for it.  Featuring a creamy and rich risotto cake flash fried and filled with cheese the dish was next topped with a farm fresh hen-egg served sunny side and then accented with an ample portion of mullet bottarga - hence the \"two eggs.\"  Textural and rich the dish shined despite its price tag and once again showed off Batali's skill with eggs.\n\nArriving next was my pizza and fried item.  First off, Zucchini Blossoms with Picorino Fritti consisted of five flavorful and lightly fried blossoms loaded with a zesty pecorino that melted just enough to give contrast.  Light and sweet to complement the savory cheese, the blossoms were actually more fragrant that I was used to and had a great \"aftertaste\" that lingered on the palate.\n\nFinishing the blossoms I suddenly realized just how large the pizzas were and knowing I A) needed to spend $50 to use my certificate, B) wanted dessert, and C) had the previously mentioned dinner in a few hours I decided to only eat half the pizza - a half that turned into 4/6 of the pizza plus all of the toppings from the remaining slices after a couple bites.  Featuring a perfect and buttery cracker crust topped with pulled Ham hock, braised Endive, ricotta, and mozzarella the pizza was stated to be a daily special and it was incredible - possibly the best pizza I've had in a couple of years.  Smoky and savory yet sweet the ham was wonderfully tender while the crispy endive proved a nice foil with its mildly pungent tones.  The blend of cheeses worked well to accent the toppings without overwhelming, something I've found Batali's team particularly skilled at in past experiences.\n\nAllowing my servers to clear the table (at this point inexplicably still holding the plates of every dish I'd consumed) and to finally refill my water (only 1 refill during the 70 minute meal) I watched the \"Street performers\" while awaiting my dessert.  Feeling somewhat full I decided against the \"dessert du jour\" - profiteroles, and instead opted for one of Enoteca's signature gelato sundaes - Concord Grape Sorbetto, Peanut Butter Gelato, Peanut Butter Cookie, frozen Concord Grapes.  Presented beautifully with a small gelato trowel I proceeded to crumble up the cookie and take a taste.  First impressed by the incredibly \"grape-like\" flavor of the sorbet and its tart almost wine-like aroma I next took a bite of the smooth and creamy gelato - literally like a blend of butter and peanut butter but cold.  Finally, mixing the two - heaven - like the best peanut butter and jelly you've never had.  \n\nWhen it was all said and done my total bill came out to $57, or $35ish including my certificate - quite frankly, a steal for a Batali meal and especially in such a unique setting.  While clearly not as \"refined\" as Babbo or Mozza, I actually liked the atmosphere and food at Enoteca much more than that at Otto - I also didn't have to wait for 2 hours for a seat.  While service could have been better and prices perhaps slightly lower on the due uova, nothing was out of line and I'd certainly consider returning to Enoteca San Marco for a casual lunch on future visits to Vegas.

Moving from good to better, both the enormous pecan roll as well as eggy house baked challah were beautifully presented after a quick treatment on the buttered griddle and although I'd have preferred to see the French Toast offered with pure maple syrup (even if at an additional charge) this is a small quibble for what may be the best simple or 'traditional' French Toast I've had in recent memory, particularly with a portion big enough to share.  Last but not least, a limited sampling of the baked goods yielded a quintet of toothsome rugulah - all textbook - plus a final surprise I've not seen in ages; a rich half-pound slab of traditional Vanilla and Cinnamon Bread Pudding with the day-old Challah soaked in sweet milk overlying a near-savory custard base strewn with raisins, each layer delicious on its own but combining to form something wholly satisfying both cold at the counter and all the more so when warmed up later that evening.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pQSkGB3HIunzNn_vIRWUNQ"}

Generally not particularly interested in buffets given the lackluster quality of ingredients plus intrinsic flaws related to large-scale production and hot plates it was with good faith that I presumed a team the likes of that at Wing Lei would do a stellar job with sourcing as well as preparation and true to form from the moment our party of three arrived it would be hard to find fault in any aspect of the afternoon as the setting, food, and service shined.  A no reservations affair playing host to a mixture of young and old, Asian and Caucasian, it was with dim sum that the majority of tables began and with carts circulating at intervals of no more than ten minutes each and every item arrived hot and fresh, the offerings shining with delicate shark's fin, snappy lobster, and textbook har gow amongst the most impressive steamed items while fried taro root dumplings, juicy XLB, and crispy duck plus pork belly with a crackling cr\u00e8me brulee skin also wowed.  Moving next to the vast expanse of items both hot and cold, it was in the soup station that I found two of my favorites - the congee as rich and textural as the bisque proved buttery and sweet (if not particularly Chinese at all) - while split 1.5lb lobsters, King Crab Claws, and prepared to order sushi was all immaculate, an easy place for those so inclined to more than make up for the cost of entry.  Focusing less on steam-tray hot items but very impressed by cured duck balanced by sliced pears, fatty yet supple Tomahawk chop, and tender grilled scallops, meaty sea bass, plus lobster salad in delicate ponzu it was at last to desserts that I moved and sampling each one of the sweets it would be difficult to say which I enjoyed the most as the dense caramel coffee crunch and coconut lychee financier were as good as any similar dessert served on the strip, yet given the choice to revisit just one item it was to the Yuzu Cheesecake dipped in White Chocolate that I returned - the creamy center with light citrus and a smooth chocolate shell redefining a dessert I rarely, if ever, order on a restaurant menu.  Undoubtedly a decadent brunch but also a case where I feel I got exactly what I paid for suffice it to say I can't wait for the Year of the Sheep...and more exploration of Vegas' wide selection of Asian cuisines, both casual and upscale, in the interim.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RRtu1D6qpVcpiQnMM8EhIg"}

Featuring all the 'standards' of a modern American bakery with options ranging from simple cupcakes and cookies to more fanciful macarons and choux-based options plus croissants and cinnamon rolls that did not even *appear* appetizing it was a wide swath of the menu that I was able to sample given a collection of petit fores, but almost across the board every single item was simply 'sweet' with indistinct flavors and off-textures - soggy choux, dry cake, and cloying cooked frostings the biggest offenders.  Focusing on the few items that at least worked in parts, the red velvet far outdid the funfetti and 'breakfast' options by presenting moist cake and tangy cream cheese frosting while both tarts, though far too sweet to let natural fruits shine, presented a respectable buttery crust that in more restrained hands could produce a great seasonal pie.   Speaking last to macarons, the general quality of most I've tasted in Las Vegas lacking, I would strongly recommend those preferring jam based centers take a look here as both cookies featured good crackle giving way to a quickly dissipating crumb over intense filling, the apple again a bit saccharine but the strawberry like an early bite of summer...two great bites amidst a $25 tab quoted off the top of the clerk's head without any listed prices or detailed receipt, none of it a reason to return even given the proximity as I've produced better versions of all but the macarons in my own kitchen.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_F_6tiqmQoAupzlhp-7M5Q"}

Opting to stick with \"Mad About Favorite Flavors\" rather than getting too creative it was to a quartet of cakes that my order led and beginning with the most simple of options I was immediately impressed as natural aromatics flooded the palate first from smooth vanilla and then with poignant cinnamon, both beneath soft buttercream and a decorative cookie.  Moving next to a duo of favorites it was unfortunately in the carrot cake that the bakers would stumble as a citrus center did nothing for the underspiced cake but with thick cream cheese frosting applied liberally as a saving grace the tasting quickly recovered with rich red velvet, the ample cocoa notes finding a suitable foil in vanilla top notes and a tangy finish all the better alongside a cup of good coffee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "117Pv1lakUyYKRoko0zvQQ"}

Arriving on the strip around 8:00am and finding meter parking for a mere 50 cents we made our way from the car, hit the ATM (cash only at Pamela's) and entered the restaurant to find it just under 1/2 full.  Invited by a friendly young woman to seat ourselves we opted for a booth along the wall and sat for a moment absorbing the kitsch...vinyl furniture, plastic menus, stone walls, and random photographs of celebrities past and present.\n\nOpening the menus and blatantly skipping all the boring eggs, bacon, and ham our waitress appeared to fill drink orders.  With only sweet n' low and sugar available for the coffee I opted to stick with water while my mom chose coffee and my sister selected tea.  Drinks delivered, including full pitchers of each to put the diner on refill duty, we placed our orders and browsed the lively restaurant while listening to the sounds of classic tunes overhead.  Founded in 1980 Pamela's certainly appeared older than its stated age, but it worked.\n\nWaiting less than fifteen minutes our waitress checked in on us to be sure nothing else was needed and to let us know our food would be right out...after watching our neighbors receive their options I have to admit I was quite excited...and without fail the food arrived moments later, piping hot from the griddle.  With each of us selecting a different item and each plate large in portion and ample in flavor there was much sharing to be done.\n\nBeginning first with my selection, perhaps Pamela's most famous option, I opted for the Strawberry Hotcakes.  Served in Pamela's famous crepe style the hotcakes themselves were divine.  Yeasty and soft yet caramelized and crisp around the circumference the pancakes themselves were stunning.  More impressive yet, ordered in the peak of strawberry season, the cakes were absolutely stuffed with super sweet fresh strawberries, brown sugar, and a zippy sour cream then topped with whipped cream.  Adding a touch of syrup (unfortunately not pure maple) the whole plate came alive - really, the dish made a fantastic breakfast but could have just as easily been served as dessert.\n\nFollowing my lead and going with the signature hotcakes my mother received two enormous cakes absolutely crammed with hot bananas, bittersweet chocolate chips, and packed with whipped cream.  Nicely caramelized and crispy along the edges I sensed more of the yeasty and buttery nature of the batter in her batch and also perhaps the scent of nutmeg - I think it was in the batter, but perhaps it was the bananas - either way, it was excellent.\n\nFiguring she would get plenty of opportunity to taste the pancakes my sister opted to try Pamela's French Toast - specifically the Croissant French Toast featuring two split house made croissants soaked in cinnamon-vanilla egg batter and topped with caramel sauce and nuts.  In order to understand how sweet this was you'd have to know my sister - the lady puts syrup on nearly anything that can be consumed for breakfast...and after her first bite she stated \"wow, this doesn't even need syrup!\"  With Buttery croissants nicely pan crisped, crunchy oven roasted almonds and walnuts, and decadent caramel syrup the best way to describe the dish would be a deconstructed cinnamon roll, but better.\n\nSettling the modest bill and leaving an ample tip we left Pamela's very content and with blood sugar certainly well above fasting levels - the total duration of our meal was only 45 minutes but it actually felt much longer and not at all rushed.  Pleasant service, a nice setting, and a wonderful (albeit limited) menu I only wish Pamela's would offer some alternative sweeteners and a better brand of syrup...with those minor tweaks a great breakfast could have easily been in consideration for one of the best ever.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2K-XaFjaHUR8Dp6QAihITg"}

Clearly not a typical pre-dawn patron for the Los Angeles import whose vast size only serves to magnify the sound emitted from LCDs displaying videos of top-40 hits it was with a request for a table toward the rear of the restaurant that I sought solace from the post-club 'scene' and graciously assenting to my appeal despite the section being otherwise unpopulated I was no sooner seated than a young woman named Deidre arrived along with a menu and all the right answers to questions regarding an order meant to make the most of my morning.  Happily offering a true \"All Day\" experience inclusive of breakfast favorites straight through sandwiches and steaks to dessert it was with gluttonous eyes focused more on variety than the costs involved that I inquired about single serving options and after confirming with the cook that such an order could be compiled it was in a quintet that I partook, a bottomless cup of coffee never coming close to half-empty throughout my sixty minute stay.  Opting to proceed in two courses with the first consisting of three a la carte griddle favorites plus a decidedly dry cinnamon roll it was undoubtedly the eggy French Toast that shined the brightest of the selections and with fresh fruit toppings all made in house along with hand whipped vanilla cream I'd be hard pressed to suggest which accoutrement was actually 'best,' though the juicy ripe peaches and boozy bananas foster certainly made an equally strong case.  Undoubtedly a substantial order given the heft of the custard laden challah it was unfettered that I moved on to a choice of desserts and although the restaurant's signature carrot cake certainly warranted a second look it was in the 'Heaven n' Hell' style bread pudding that I placed my trust - the juxtaposition of black and white batons proving absolutely delightful with the former resembling a semi-set brownie while the later featured laminated layers soaked in butter and cream that slowly melted on the tongue.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_45p8kOA__aNycVVe-n-KA"}

Moving next to three plates divided and shared the kitchen again proved more than competent with diner classics and although ingredient quality could certainly be better the fried Monte Cristo was a truly faithful rendition of the classic yet not overly greasy while the French toasts were each rich and flavorful, the croissant version compromised by mushy blueberries but loaded with butter while peanut butter was a skilled kissed version of a childhood favorite, the sort of memories immune to ingredient quality or surly service and just plain delicious.", "type": "review", "business_id": "R0MhNwopWTWXcg8CPAFgpw"}

Fazel, a gracious man with obvious passion for his products and preparation, the story of Tender's relationship with farmers up north as well as the Chef's Midwestern upbringing soon had me all the more interested in what was to come - not even the frequently empty water glasses, 80F+ temperature, or ongoing \"beautiful,\" \"wonderful,\" \"excellent\" verbiage being fed to each and every table around enough to bring me down.\n\nWith the aforementioned oysters forgotten, course one began with two appetizers, and as one friend was treated to a rich broth teaming with tender oxtail, caramelized onions, grilled bread, and cheese that ranks amongst the best I have ever tasted my $19 slice of duck liver a true first glimpse of things to come - the foie gras' sapor more intense than generally seen amongst steakhouse fare with the crispy rice cake providing a texture-rich base more than amicable to sopping up both the offal's residual oils and a drizzle of port wine and juicy red fruit.\n\nMoving on to mains and sides, it was after some delay that seven plates arrived tableside and although presentations were sorely lacking, save for the young man who described the seafood tasting, it would be nearly impossible to find fault in anything save for mundane potatoes - the smoky bone marrow portion exceedingly generous given the $6 tab while both the crispy duck bacon and thick, cheese-imbued rice were equally well prepared, all of them dishes best shared.\n\nSpeaking to entrees, for myself the beef was a bit humdrum, though the sear and center were both on-point medium rare, while both tastings were every bit as good as the quality of sourcing, the whitefish admittedly a touch fishy thus allowing both salmon and scallops to steal the spotlight while each constituent of the wild game trio was peerless, the Osso Buco tender and full of funk while both elk and boar delivered on the chef's promise that even his leaner cuts were bound to impress, the latter particularly impressive as smoky saline notes met a perfect foil in housemade chutney.\n\nAt this point feeling the effects of a full stomach combined with the restaurant's toasty temperature it was in an elegant iced coffee presentation that I indulged while my tablemate fancied tea and genuinely unable to resist dessert the team at Tender had me at the words \"Bread Pudding,\" the sizable round swimming in a pool of boozed up bananas beneath slowly melting ice cream - an excellent dish its own right but certainly no match for the torched s'mores cake, an absolute stunner that was neither too sweet nor too heavy, something I only wish could have been said for a fallen-on-arrival souffl\u00e9 that was worth neither the twenty minute preparation nor the calories involved.\n\nFlying well below the radar given its gaming-floor adjacent location in Luxor, Tender is at once the sort of 'big meat' place that many envision when thinking of the typical Vegas steakhouse AND the sort of place where a largely unheralded chef has been allowed to carve out a niche that few would expect - if only the front of house could be brought up to speed with the team in the kitchen there is little doubt that this diamond in the rough could shine amongst the city's best.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WqdCrAhYSewDAom1qY-t_g"}

Simple, savory, and perhaps the deal of the day this plate of tender eggplant, briny capers, pine nuts, tomatoes, balsamic, and olive oil with hints of basil and onion was plenty to share and would have only been better with some warm bread for dipping.\n\nTrippa alla Toscanaccia: $14. With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure, this was really good.  Thin like soup and plenty fatty despite being loaded with meat with notes of onion, tomato, and vinegar at the fore while mint and garlic came through on the palate this was another place that some extra bread would have been welcomed as far too much broth remained at the end.\n\nMille Feuille: $7. While I contest this should have been referred to as a Napoleon I guess it really doesn't matter because regardless of nationality what we received was flaky pastry wrapped around lightly sweetened pastry cream.  Clearly not as transcendent as some of the a la minute options being turned out elsewhere as this one had been stored in the chiller all day I have to say I was largely impressed by the separation of the layers and lack of sogginess.\n\nRhum Baba: $2 each.  Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen.\n\nStruffoli: $4.  Another very traditional selection you don't really see all that often at Italian markets or bakeries these marble sized pastry balls were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and absolutely dredged in honey.  A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot, though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish.\n\nCornetti: $2.50.  Golden crisp on the outside, buttery caverns within, and fortunately a brand new batch when I ran back in to make my purchase this warm nutella croissant was the highlight of the sweets for me - a strong contender for best croissant in town that remained fluffy despite the chocolate-hazenut filling while the exterior shattered to the tooth.\n\nSfogliatelle: $3.  Lightly citrus thanks to the use of candied lemon peel, even crispier than the cornetti on the outside, and a pillow of ricotta smoothness within - if you go to Andreoli and don't order one of these you're missing out...as a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that this item alone is worth a visit to Andreoli as it was every bit as good as any I've ever tasted on either coast (admittedly having not yet been to Italy.)\n \nSchiacciata uva: $4.  I'd never tried this prior to Andreoli's and, as a matter of fact, I'd never even seen it.  Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet, light, and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations.\n\nThe Verdict:  Fresh, rustic, and very authentic this one definitely goes on the 'under the radar' list and while I'm unable to speak to Andreoli's quality during normal business hours I can only say that based on what I experienced at the Christmas festival I'm eager to return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YQz2fnfnL5eAWn1zOmKYnQ"}

At first a bit put off by this obvious isolation but quickly greeted by a pleasant young woman who proved both friendly and efficient we decided to stay, outcast or not, and what followed was actually a very impressive lunch at a bargain basement price.\n\nOnce (unbeknownst to us) featured on \"Man vs. Food\" it became obvious soon on opening the menu which items were considered signatures and with myself opting for the Del Rey while my mother and aunt went with similar, less gaudy options, plus a pair of icy mixed drinks similar in texture to the Slush-Puppies of my youth but far more delicious; the Arnold Palmer especially excellent with light bitter and a lot of sour without being overly sweet. \n\nMoving on to the food, with each sandwich served on a fluffy and yeasty bolillo roll stuffed with flavorful meat and top quality produce, I can honestly say that every single bite of the Del Ray exceeded my expectations while both my mother and aunt seemed happy with their selections, as well.  Generally not one to order a sandwich as I find them monotonous after a couple of bites the Del Ray succeeded where so many others failed because each bite was slightly different from the last, some smoky, some spicy, some saline, and others creamy and rife with fresh avocado.  Large, easily enough to share, and certainly not for the faint of heart this is definitely the sort of dish that could have flopped and become nothing but a gluttonous mess but in reality, despite all the ingredients, never once did something seem unnecessary or overwhelming to the other ingredients...and as much as restraint probably would have been wise I enjoyed every last bite, a fact that *almost* made me glad they were sold out of their signature King Cake; though the dense \"Chocoflan\" of moist chocolate pudding cake meets smooth, creamy flan was quite rich itself. \n\nWith the Del Rey ringing in at a mere $9.50 I find it hard to believe that there is any place in the city offering more interesting Mexican food at a better value, though if there is I need to seek it out...right after I find some dining pals to head back to Los Reyes for Pambasos and Huaraches and some King Cake.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bzDs0u8I-z231QVdIQWkrA"}

Known for his New York Outpost, Payard himself is rarely found at this location (unlike Jean-Philippe over at the Bellagio) but the shop, scene, and food are no less impressive.\n\nArriving in Vegas around 8am local time after a non-stop flight, I got checked in and made my way to Payard by 10:05 for breakfast.  Though the all-you-can-eat continental buffet was still ongoing, I first stopped in the Patisserie to browse chocolate and dessert selections, and to pick up some candies for my mother and aunt.  While everything was beautiful and the crepes appeared wonderful, the prices were decidedly even worse than Jean Phillipe and the selection less impressive.  After making my purchase I made my way next door for breakfast.\n\nSeating was readily available and the friendly attendant/waitress seated me near a window next to two rather crude foreign businessmen who preceded to discuss their sex lives quite loudly in public.  Though the waitress once asked them to keep it down, it did not really help.  So much for class.....thankfully they were easy to ignore as I watched the chef perform his craft at the wide open kitchen station in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nCoffee was pretty standard fare and was served quickly and refilled mostly adequately (I was empty for a good 5 minutes between cups 2 and 3) despite there being multiple servers who appeared to be standing around chatting amongst themselves.  For breakfast I opted for the Almond Croissant and the Payard Chocolate Waffles with Nutella and Caramelized Bananas.\n\nServed first, the Croissant was heavenly with a buttery crisp crust surrounding a flawlessly fluffy center stuffed (and I mean jam packed) with almond compote.  Sweet yet savory, this was and still is the best Croissant I've ever tasted in terms of texture and second best in terms of taste (sorry, the Almond Chocolate Croissant at Bouchon is a revelation.)\n\nMy second dish was the Waffles and all I can do is be amazed.  Small yet incredibly decadent, the portion was just right.....any more and I'd have been overly full.  The waffles were soft and fluffy (unlike the super-crisp chocolate waffles at Norma's NYC) while the Bananas were perfectly sweet and succulent.  The Nutella was more than ample, as well.  All said, a beautiful and tasty dish that I'd certainly recommend.\n\nMy only complaint aside from my co-diners and the coffee would be the fact that everything felt quite rushed....my whole meal lasting a mere 40 minutes and check delivered without asking if there was anything else I wanted.  My server only visited the table when delivering an item or to collect the bill and the to-go coffee I was promised was never delivered.  All told, fantastic food in a so-so environment with so-so service.  High prices, but absolutely worth it, and a breakfast that would be \"best of\" in many other cities.\n\nSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V9euJerhCkh7PXKjtsE2rQ"}

Speaking with the friendly young lady behind the counter I was informed that since they were getting close to the end of the day anything left in the case was buy one get one.  \"Bogo on amazing french pastries?\" I thought - I'd be a fool to pass that up.  Selecting two they were packed into a pretty plastic container and I went to meet my friend.  Offering my pal his selection he told me he had just finished dinner with his wife and was stuffed - but he did try a bite of each.\n\nStarting first with the Tiramisu - not French, but a must almost anywhere I see it - the dish was served fancifully in a plexi-glass square.  Layers of vanilla mascarpone, rum soaked lady fingers, cream, and dusted with cocoa and a bit of chocolate drizzle the dish actually hid a surprise - a core of Raspberry.  While my sister would have been greatly upset by this unannounced guest I have to admit I liked the manner in which the fruity sweetness balanced the dark cocoa tones and heavy rum.\n\nThe second dish, one of Payard's signatures, was vastly more impressive than the tiramisu - it was called Louvre.  Featuring \"Chocolate mousse and hazelnut mousse with a hazelnut dacquoise\" and topped with a thick 72% dark chocolate shell I can only compare this dish to one thing (something that doesn't do it a bit of justice,) a nutella version of a peanut butter cup.  With the gelatinous shell giving way to a milk chocolate mousse, then hazelnut mousse, then a hazelnut cookie...a beautiful blending of textures, tastes, and not heavy at all.\n\nAll said, Raku with tax and tip, a cab ride, coffee, and two pastries from Payard cost me less than Colors of Caviar would cost a la carte at Guy Savoy - sure \"Colors\" has vastly more ingredient cost, but that just goes to show that for the discerning foodie you can indeed do some fine dining in Vegas without totally breaking the bank.  While I'm certainly not going to say that a split meal at Raku and Payard is in any way comparable to dinner at Savoy or Robuchon, I do believe that during future culinary trips outside of Ohio I'm going to make sure at least one place is \"off the beaten path\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "V9euJerhCkh7PXKjtsE2rQ"}

Making our way into the vast confines of the restaurant we stated our names, though reservations clearly were not necessary.  Led to a comfortable 4-top near the large glass windows we marveled at the black and white tiled floor, raw bar, cheese bar, cork wreath, chandeliers, and generally lovely layout of the space.  Greeted quickly by our server, Gina G, we were provided with menus and water was filled for us all while the others opted for Orange Juice, Hot Tea, and a specialty French Press of Rwandan Komera coffee - a bold citrus blend with plenty of body that didn't really appeal to me, but my mother enjoyed a lot.\n\nBrowsing the menu of both traditional and non-traditional bistro fare we settled on a pair of sweets and a pair of savories to be shared around.  With service good throughout the meal there were two small issues considering only one other table was seated during the entirety of our brunch - the first being the fact that my water actually reached empty twice and the second when one of the ancillary staff nearly filled my sister's tea with coffee.  With light classical playing overhead it would be approximately 15 minutes before our plates would arrive.\n\nFor myself, the standard in such circumstances; a Croque Madame with Country Ham, Gruy\u00e8re Cheese, Sauce Mornay,Crispy Sourdough, Fried Egg and a side of Pommes Frites with organic Heinz ketchup.  While the frites were largely a miss - hot but somewhat anemic and flavorless, the sandwich was actually quite good, albeit lightly topped.  With two thin slices of rich ham and an equal portion of Gruyere sandwiched between the crispy bread, the highlight of the dish was unquestionably the lovely Mornay and creamy egg yolk.  \n\nThe second option, my mothers, was the crispy Belgium Waffle with fresh Berries and Housemade Vanilla Syrup.  Simple in concept the execution of this dish was quite poor in my opinion - the waffle doughy and the vanilla syrup tasting identical to the pure maple syrup (not a bad thing, but false advertising) until blended with the dollop of vanilla cream atop the waffles.  Admittedly the fruits were very fresh and tasty, however.\n\nOpting for more unique dishes proved advantageous to my sister and aunt, the sooner ordering the Crab Oscar Benedict with Asparagus, Dungeness crab, Poached Eggs, and Citrus Hollandaise atop a round popover.  Already hefty and artery clogging with the crab clearly cooked in butter and the lovely hollandaise with just a tinge of lemon, piercing the two creamy eggs with a fork added a whole new level to the dish.  With white asparagus adding necessary fiber and texture the entirety of this dish was decadence well worth the calories.\n\nThe final choice, my aunts, was another winner - Banana and Mascarpone stuffed French Toast with Saigon cinnamon and pure maple syrup.  With bread similarly shaped to that from the popover I gather the toast itself was actually a bread pudding style custard.  With a thick layer of banana accented sweet cheese inside and fresh bananas atop the toast was first pan seared and then torch bruleed forming a crisp top that crackled on cutting.  With plentiful notes of cinnamon and the maple syrup on the plate instead of being poured over top I really liked the flavor profile and presentation of the dish, as did my aunt who is not keen on maple as she finds it overwhelming.\n\nWith tax and tip the total for brunch would run approximately $25 a person - not a bargain compared to the $5 grand slam at Denny's that we passed to get there, but on par with the prices at Mon Ami Gabi and slightly less pricey than MoZen, Tableau, or Bouchon.  With that said, while there was nothing wrong with Morels, it also didn't move me or wow me and at such a price I'd much sooner take the elevator up to Bouchon at the Venetian than the escalator down to Morels at the Palazzo.  The Croque, Frites, French Toast, and Waffles at Bouchon are simply better....and the eggs and crab dish I'd have there on Christmas day left that Benedict a distant memory, regardless of how good it was.", "type": "review", "business_id": "alWTl5MRC4VE2t9W1mNSIQ"}

Tasting bites throughout the afternoon interspersed with sips of La Colombe's Corsica it was perhaps an effect of my coffee predilections that my final two tastes of The Cupcakery would prove most memorable and as good as the prototypical Red Velvet was in delivering light cocoa beneath aggressive tang it was the seasonal \"El Rolo\" that stole the spotlight, an Amedei-like smokiness to the dark chocolate proving an ample foil to intensely sweet liquid caramel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HbWwVvpXTKA1PAr-9TCj1g"}

At dinner I imagine this place is a solid 5.\n\nArriving toward the end of the lunch hour we entered Carnevino dressed casually - a tad out of place compared to the all black and white clad service staff.  Seated promptly and greeted by Josh nearly the moment we were seated the service never faltered throughout our stay - water was refilled rapidly, dishes served impeccably, and bread service...we'll get to that later.  Browsing around the large room and high ceilings, dark woods, and white tablecloths covering widely spaced tables the restaurant definitely felt very Batali - and the soundtrack of Beatles, Eagles, The Who, and Stones coming from the front of the house left no doubt.\n\nMy buddies having already begun their daily drinking at the tables and myself a non drinker we all opted for water - water with ice and multiple refills.  After taking orders and heading to the kitchen we were brought the first of a couple rounds of dinner rolls.  Tasting the incredibly complex sweet yet salty and crisp exterior which yielded a pillow-soft interior not unlike a croissant I inquired of our server what exactly constituted these delicious pieces of carbohydrate - lardo, butter, flour, yeast, and \"a bit of parmesan\" I was informed.\n\nAllowed to sit and chat for a while before our mains arrived I joked with my buddies about the fact that we had gone to, arguably, the best steak restaurant in Vegas and neither had ordered a steak - one opting for the Tuna caponata, cocoa agro dolce and the other choosing The Burger with pancetta and onion cheddar and arugula salad.  Stating that steak was a \"dinner food' I clearly realized that I needed more epicurean friends.  All joking aside, both of them loved their meal and their dishes looked and smelled excellent  - while my one friend didn't prefer the cocoa accents to his tuna he loved the fish and my other friend stated the burger was the best he'd ever tasted.\nFor myself, the decisions for this meal were based on previous Batali experience and both dishes wowed - as expected.  Served together since neither of my friends opted for an appetizer the first dish was from the dinner anti-pasti menu and was entitled \"House-Cured Pastrami\" with local duck egg and emerald butter lettuce.  While I generally don't prefer beef textures, particularly \"lunch meats\" such as pastrami I was told by Mr. Feit that this dish was more like beef bacon and was made from the dry-aged stock of BBL beef.  Trusting his judgement I have to admit this dish was very impressive with the pastrami truly being like a clean and spicy pork bacon in texture - great fattiness and almost melt in the mouth texture despite its somewhat dehydrated nature.  Accompanying the pastrami - a single duck egg sunny side up alongside a delicate and dare-I-say \"buttery\" lettuce.  Atop the dish was a combination of aged balsamic, olive oil, cracked pepper, and pan juices from the slight pan-kissing of the pastrami.  Breaking the yolk of the egg the dish was given a creamy contrast to the other sharp, spicy, and acidic flavors and truly impressed.\n\nThe second dish, also requested from the dinner menu, was entitled Sweetbreads \"al boscaiolo\" which according to my server meant \"lumberjack style.\"  Served with pan seared mixed/chopped mushrooms, fresh peas, spinach, and a reduction of honey, rosemary, and perhaps sage the sweetbreads were perfectly flash fried to retain their creamy texture and without a bit of brine.  Clearly using a bit of salt, pepper, and perhaps cheese in the crispy coating the sweetbreads on their own would have been superb - but pairing their creamy and spicy preparation with the crisp yet mildly sweet greens, woody and smooth mushrooms, and heavily accented honey made the dish a truly one of a kind experience - while not as \"refined\" as Guy Savoy's preparation the night prior these may have actually been my favorite sweetbread preparation all time - or at least on par with the versions at Alex, Savoy, and (as much as I dislike admitting it) Michael Symon's Lola.\n\nFinishing up our meals we were told that the dessert menu at lunch was limited to cheeses and ice creams and as such we deferred - too bad since the peach fritters and roasted spiced dates sounded excellent.  Settling the tab the meal was actually my cheapest lunch or dinner in Vegas yet extremely rewarding.  While I could've certainly done without the Eagles (I hate the f&%ckin' Eagles Man! - Lebowski) the service was excellent and accommodating from e-mail all the way to leaving the restaurant and the food was superb.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3MmHmJXr8Ltk_Z5EGE4KUw"}

A large space with soaring ceilings, heavy woods, and smooth marble befitting both a Vegas Steakhouse and the Italian Chef/Restaurateur backing the venture it was at the bar that our evening began while a large table was cleared in the larger back room and with excellent cocktails and a superlative wine list it would not be long before we were seated, drinks in hand - the subsequent two and a half hours awash in food, cocktails, wine, stories, and laughs with servers who kept pace amicably.  Beginning with appetizers and progressing through perfectly pastas, lightly prepared proteins, interesting sides, and thankfully dainty desserts with a main course of nearly 8lbs of aged super-prime beef from Adam Lang plus supple duck and a hefty piece of foie gras poached in Barolo it would be difficult to imagine any \"steakhouse\" putting on a better performance than what we experienced that evening and although such a meal invariably comes with a substantial tab, particularly on the Vegas Strip, this was a night of excess worthy of the expense and without a doubt a night to remember.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3MmHmJXr8Ltk_Z5EGE4KUw"}

Known by the term 'Riserva' and nowhere present on the restaurant menu our eight-top's 240+ day dry-aged steak experience actually began years prior with selective sourcing, breeding, feeding, butchery, as well as storage - an aged bacteria direct from Italy driving the latter - and with each stage described at length throughout the course of a 3.5 hour meal that entailed no less than twenty other outstanding plates plus far too many drinks it can only be said that nothing could have prepared us for the meal's apex, four different steaks plus a chop offering an education in things few will ever have the opportunity to taste.  Having already visited Carnevino twice, with wowed results each time, it seems almost a crime to gloss over items like a textbook bellini thick with white peach or tartare so tender it simply dissolved on the tongue but with all apologies to tender pastas including the famous beef cheek ravioli as well as the \"super chicken\" egg raviolo suffice it to say that only a single side of mushrooms was less than exemplary...but not a one of them could match the meats, the younger steaks and chop easily on par with those from last year while the Riserva was almost unimaginably tender with a flavor profile that ranged from walnuts to stilton to truffles as a buttery basenote lingered in each bite.   Undoubtedly a big budget event in a space not unaccustomed to such things it was finally with a table of desserts followed by a small plate of cookies that the evening would end and visited by head chef Nicole Brisson before our departure each of us said our thanks - an invite to tour the aging facility something I look forward to doing soon and a return visit already in the planning stages for when my friends are next in town.\n\nConsidered by some, including myself, to be the best steakhouse in the country even before this meal suffice it to say that Carnevino upped the stakes (and steaks) for all future meals here in Las Vegas - the private room, the exquisite services, the specially requested soundtrack of Pearl Jam's Ten played throughout the restaurant, more than a handful of 'gifts' joining each course, and especially the Riserva all making a special meal truly world class.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3MmHmJXr8Ltk_Z5EGE4KUw"}

Crunchy on the exterior and just a bit toothsome within I'm still not exactly sure that I'm 'sold' on the way so many chef's flaunt the use of duck fat for fries but all things being equal these were really good, particularly the fine herbs interpretation.\n\nFoie Gras Duo with Roasted Bing Cherries and Almond Streusel:  While I generally eschew the restaurant week menu it was the non-RW appetizer that would prove to be the biggest failure of the meal and, perhaps, the biggest food failure I've had since moving to the valley - simply stated, this was a piece of foie that should have never made it to the kitchen let alone to the table.  Undersized, overcooked, poorly cleaned, and still somehow lukewarm on arrival there was really nothing to like about the seared portion of liver aside from the cherries - and least of all the veins and sinew zigzagging the palate.  Moving on to the second half of the duo a creamy terrine beneath cherry gel was presented and paired with buttery brioche it was nearly good enough to save the plate - but not quite, particularly as Christina's response to our complaint was simply taking the dish off of our bill rather than suggesting the chef take a second try with a better piece of foie gras and more attention to detail.\n\nCaramelized Black Mission Figs- Spicy Sopressata, Preserved Lemon Ricotta:  Rather horrified by the liver I was heartened by the first choice from the restaurant week menu; a sort of composed cheese plate featuring the intense fructose of fresh figs matched up against the bite of sopressata and lightly fragranced ricotta.  Like most Bay Area chefs I'd suggest that if a Mina restaurant is offering up a fig dish you'd be wise to order it.\n\nCrispy Sonoma Duck Breast- Cipollini & Brussel Sprout Hash, Huckleberry Compote:  One of three RW main courses and for my dollar the most obvious choice by a landslide the kitchen was gracious enough to serve us each a separate portion of the Sonoma margret and while I cannot say it soared to the same levels as Chef DeRuvo's version at Davanti Enoteca a few weeks prior this was another excellent preparation of my favorite protein with the aged fowl's slight must perfectly tempered by the pungent hash and sweet berry reduction.  Easily cut with the edge of a fork despite being served with one of the restaurant's signature steak knives and as tender as you could hope I'm still having trouble getting over the fact that I now live in a city where good duck exists at not just one but multiple restaurants.\n\nWhole Fried Chicken for Two with Truffled Mac & Cheese:  Yes it is $58 for chicken, but compared to the $200 Bresse at Savoy or the $78 version at The Nomad I guess you could call this brined, battered, and duck fat fried version a bargain if it was nearly as good as the others...and thankfully it was.  Featuring a plump hen with breading so dainty that it approximated the thickness of skin the bird was carved tableside and laid on a bed of truffled macaroni and cheese plus baby carrots before being topped with crispy onion rings and with each of the accoutrements quite delicious none were as good as the chicken itself - dense, moist, full of flavor, and complimented by rather than being overwhelmed by the seasoned breading.\n\nBourbon Bar- Dark Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Pretzel:  Seeing as how my writing is impossibly behind at this point suffice it to say I'd already experienced this dish at Baltimore's Wit & Wisdom and I was glad to revisit it as the alternate RW dessert.  Described loosely as the chef's interpretation of a candy bar this dessert beings with a core of sweetened peanut butter mousse and dresses it with dense 70% dark chocolate ganache before bespeckling it with crumbled nougat, peanuts, and finally chocolate covered pretzels.\n\nCarrot Cake with Cream Cheese Icing, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Sorbet:  With Mr. Mathias stopping by to check in a conversation about Mina et al's approach to pastry ensued and after mentioning my fondness for his unique interpretations of American comfort foods we found ourselves gifted this one last plate.  Beginning at its base with airy spice cake flecked with carrots and studded with currants atop a smear of whipped cream cheese this dessert, much like the panna cotta, was taken to a whole different level through the addition of two frozen quenelles, one tangy cr\u00e8me fraiche and the other strikingly vegetal carrots.  Bite for bite the most delicious and complicated of the evening's three desserts this was just another exam  how Chef Mina understands the powerful effect of American comfort food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8m08a9xJKmANwmeuR-0bPA"}

Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?) my friend who arrived early on Thursday morning doesn't fancy Italian and Vegas' dearth of quality lunch options led us to Table 10 at the Palazzo.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, regardless of others' opinions on Emeril his cooking is top notch, and his bread puddings and shrimp have never failed to be excellent. \n \nArriving at Table 10, one immediately notices the staunch contrast to Delmonico's white/wood/elegant setting with the fancy wrought iron gates out front and multiple colored tables, televisions, and wide open kitchen.  Elegant yet trendy in a similar fashion to the New Orleans Fish House, yet more unique and upscale in appearance, decor, and service.....sort of bridging the gap between the casual Fish House and upscale Delmonico.\n \nSeating was prompt and menus and water were delivered quickly.  While the lunch menu was slightly more limited than dinner, the options were still substantial.  I was slightly annoyed by our waiter who seemed somewhat bored and aloof as he mentioned their \"famous signature dish\" was the Maine lobster pot pie (the most expensive item on the menu.)  First of all, a dish cannot be \"famous\" when you've only been open for a couple of months.  Secondly, as a creole cook, Maine lobster is NOT signature....shrimp, crawfish, and jumbalaya, and bread pudding are.  Third, this is Michael Mina's signature, not yours, so don't lie.  \n \nAs I'd had breakfast at Bouchon followed by a stop at Bouchon bakery I must admit I wasn't entirely hungry, but my buddy had not eaten since flying in from Michigan.  For my meal I selected two appetizers; the Jambalaya with andouille sausage, clams, and shrimp plus the rotisserie chicken pizza w/ mushrooms, garlic, and buffala mozzarella while my friend opted for the enormous plate of Jambalaya pasta.  After orders were taken we sat and chatted and were delivered some of the most delicious sweet butter rolls I've ever experienced.  All told I think I consumed 3 rolls but it very well could have been 5, they were that good.\n\nMains were served after approximately 20 minutes and everything looked and tasted great.  The jambalaya was spicy without being overpowering and the roux was thick and hearty.  Ample pork sausage, shrimp, crawfish, and clams were all present along with a well cooked rice that provided good texture and contrast.  Not the very best jambalaya ever, but certainly an excellent representation.  Similar to my dish, my friend's jambalaya pasta contained wonderfully cooked egg noodles and a substantial number of jumbo shrimp plus shredded crawfish in a spicy broth.\n\nWhile the jambalaya's were excellent, the pizza was even better with a truly \"cracker-thin\" crust perfectly basted with olive oil and covered with fresh veggies, tender marinated chicken, and fresh/smooth mozzarella.  While not substantial in portion, the price was right at $10 and I'd definitely put this on the list of best chicken pizzas I've tasted.  Not quite as good as Batali's pizza at Otto, but darn good.\n\nFor dessert, Bread pudding - a no brainer when dining with Emeril....though I must admit there wasn't a single bad sounding option on the dessert menu.  The bread pudding at Table 10 was exemplary consisting of a wonderfully tender Strawberry Brioche Bread Pudding, firm in texture and served hot with Toasted Almond Ice Cream on top.  From the crunchy almonds to the tart berries to the smooth icecream this dish was fantastic and the second best of the 5 Emeril options I've experienced.  Small in portion, yet just right for lunch, I would put it in my top 6 all time behind Gramercy Tavern, the two Bouchon Options, Dessert Truck, and Emeril's in Orlando.  My buddy, a fiend for all things chocolate opted for the Almost Flourless Bourbon Chocolate Cake with Tart Cherry Compote and Brown Sugar Cr\u00e8me Fraiche which he noted was very good, though not as good as the chocolate cake at Emeril's New Orleans Fish House.\n\nAll told, I'd rank Table 10 as my favorite lunch in Vegas (compared to Delmonico, Mesa Grill, Burger Bar, Sensi, and numerous buffets.)  Great quality, decent service, and a decent setting.  Looking at the menu I'd probably not return for dinner since the best items are also available at lunch, but if I lived close to Vegas I'd certainly not turn down an invite for lunch or dinner.  Best Emeril's in Vegas and second best Emeril's overall.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QozXMHqNzkVutP-FhcP30w"}

The brainchild of Duc Liao and his wife Noelle based on their time in Paris as a photographer and model, respectively, the space had originally appeared on my radar based on the recommendation of a friend and had only increased its status in my mind by advertising one of my favorite desserts - the Paris Brest - on their website.\n\nLocated in a rather unattractive strip-mall beside a Subway my arrival to Scratch would be just past noon and with the thermostat topping the century mark I made my way quickly from the car to the cute French-Chic interior and greeted by two young ladies behind the counter I was asked if I planned to dine in or take some items to go, a decision I debated for a few seconds before I was handed a menu and left to decide.  Already with lunch plans I knew the bistro menu was not the choice (though admittedly the duck and foie gras had my attention) and as such I turned my attention to the pastry case only to be told that no Paris Brest was available - a disappointment to be sure, but at the same time given the variety of options (including a number of my other favorites) not totally disheartening and after a few moments of indecision I opted for three selections, paid the modest tab, and made my way outside to enjoy.\n\nBeginning first with the only warm item of the group, an almond croissant fresh from the oven, my first bite from Scratch would show that the Liao's time in Paris had been well spent as the golden shell shattered on my bite giving way to an airy layered interior with a smear of sweet frangipane that not only added flavor and nuance to the already sweet pastry but also did not weigh down the wispy pastry inside; a fine balance not often seen in American Almond Croissants.\n\nMoving next to another French specialty, a small Salted Caramel Macaron stored refrigerated in a plastic sheath, this two bite $3 cookie would prove rather average largely due to the temperature and a degree of dampness marring its characteristic crackling shell.  With the filling ample in flavor I do wonder if perhaps the dry Arizona air has something to do with the decision to store these cookies chilled, but overall it is not a decision I fancied when it came down to texture.\n\nFor my final taste of Scratch I opted for an American classic, my typical Red Velvet cupcake, and where the macaron disappointed the cupcake achieved at the highest level; a textural masterpiece ranking in my top 3 red velvet cupcakes of all time.  Beginning first with the frosting, seemingly a small puff of sour cream cheese actually tunneling down into the body of the cake, it was quite good but where this cake truly stood out was its density - the sort of moist sponginess that made the cake seem almost undercooked as a bit of red dripped onto my hand, but in reality a veritable cloud of loaded with chocolate and vanilla tones that permeated the palate in perfect balance with the frosting.  \n\nOverall Scratch was a good visit and I feel like I (pun intended) merely scratched the surface of what they have to offer - if and when I return I'm calling ahead to make sure they have the Brest and while I'm there I'll check out that bistro menu because, really, where else can you get duck and foie gras for lunch in town and chase it with a top notch French Pastry or cupcake?", "type": "review", "business_id": "tZXPhvufHhfejGrRp554Lg"}

Arriving after a short wait and in an ample portion the dish consisted of a cool broth with a warm poached egg paired with a creamy Uni tongue and given a myriad of flavors and textures from a \"soup\" of snappy mountain yams, earthy hon-shimeji mushrooms, salty salmon roe, and pungent green onions.  Breaking the egg and stirring the broth it thickened quickly giving the whole dish a mellow and creamy texture that paired beautifully with the fresh uni and other ingredients - at $7 this may have been the most affordable uni I'd ever experienced with such great taste and honestly I would go back to Raku just to experience this dish again.\n\nArriving shortly after my first plate was finished - and with an explanation of all the little jars and bottles in front of me (a matcha sea salt, a house made soy, a japanese pepper + rice vinegar, and a chili infused oil) - Seafood with Bonito Guts Pickled in Salt looked and smelled much better than the name would arouse in one's imagination.  As others have mentioned, I really do not understand how this dish was a mere $6.  A heaping bowl filled with a mix of sashimi yellowfin, jackfish, salmon, mackerel, and sprouts each fish was extremely fresh and the sprouts lent some texture to the fleshy-melt-in-your-mouth fishes.  Topping the dish, according to my young server, was a combination of the house soy and the vinegar.  Adding a bit more soy to the already salty mix made the flavor perfect, in my opinion, though I do believe the dish could have benefited from some daikon or perhaps a crisp starch to add a bit more texture.\n\nThe next dish - well, let's just say it was so good that I ordered a second portion as my main course.  Entitled simply Steamed Egg Custard with Foie Gras the dish looked simple enough - a miso broth with scallions and a piece of Robata duck floating in the broth.  What laid beneath the broth, however, was the true treasure of the dish - a rich and hearty chawanmushi (egg custard) laden with ample accents of foie gras.  When stirred up with the wooden spoon the foie tones rose amply to the palate with the whole dish tasting like the combination of a sweet egg custard and an unctuous foie gras terrine.  While the grilled duck added a fine degree of texture to the dish, I personally thought the duck was a slight bit gamey - not bad, just not perfect.  \n\nSeeing this dish also offered in the noodle section as an Udon accompaniment I inquired from my server as to whether I could get that dish as a main course, but instead substitute the robata foie gras for the duck.  Not quite understanding my question my server went and got another server who understood perfectly, asked the chef, and assured me this would be no problem.  Receiving this dish after my robata choices and just before dessert I would strongly suggest anyone who attends Raku try this substitution for two reasons - number one, the manner in which the robata grill's high temperatures crisps the foie gras exterior while leaving the center fatty and smooth is unlike anything I've previously experienced - the charring actually mellows the foie all on its own and the texture is more \"firm,\" not unlike the roasted version I had at Blackbird in Chicago, actually.  Number two - those udon noodles served thin and cold to be dunked into a broth of foie gras, egg custard, and more foie gras...think \"chicken soup\" in its perfect form.\n\nBetween my two foie dishes I decided to indulge in a couple of Raku's robata skewers - Chicken Breast with Skin.  Fresh organic chicken wrapped in its own skin and cooked to crispy this dish presented some of the most juicy chicken I've had in some time while the addition of the skin added a crisp \"crackle\" without any breading - better than the Colonel without all the carbs and oil.  Adding first the soy and then the salt I have to say I was quite impressed by the manner in which the matcha's bitter texture worked with the savorieness of the chicken and salt.\n\nRobata course two was Kurobuta pork cheek and it, like the chicken, was excellent.  Typically quite fatty the high heat of the grill managed to melt the collagen perfectly while burning off some of the fat and only mildly crisping the skin.  The 'rarest' pork I've had since the chop at Babbo I found this to be my favorite, tastewise, of the robtata items and would compare it favorably to some of the better pork belly dishes I've had in terms of taste, texture, and fat to meat ratio.\n\nThe third robata course was something I've never eaten - Pigs Ears.  Sure I've had trotters, tail, tete, belly, cheek, and all the standard cuts - but not ear.  As others have stated - wow.  Crispy and salty on the outside, fatty next, and a thin chewy layer of cartilage in the middle - almost a 5-layer sandwich with each layer giving a different taste and texture experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

Not wanting a pint but rather to sample I made my way up the stairs to the small store to find it largely empty - a surprise since every parlor in Ohio is lined up out the door when it is 100 degrees out, but perhaps not surprising in Scottsdale where temperatures frequently reach such peaks.  Entering the store I was greeted by the smell of sugar, vanilla, and that all-too-familiar scent of ice cream cones and within moments I was greeted by a young lady ready with sampling spoons.\n\nNot wanting to be greedy but certainly wanting to sample a couple before buying in my first two tastes of Sweet Republic's Ice Cream would be Tres Leches, a dense and flavorful but largely one-dimensional vanilla and next Desert Honey, a lovely bite not dissimilar to a frozen liquid Bit-o-Honey.  With easily twenty more flavors to taste and my server not seeming to mind my next two bites would prove memorable enough to commit to a double - one scoop of Honey Blue Cheese and the other of Salted Butter Caramel - for $4.25.  Waiting for the scoops as I browsed the shops collection of cookies, candies, and even bacon brittle I thanked my server for her assistance and sitting down to enjoy my choices I was very pleased by one and blown away by the other.\n\nBeginning first with the Salted Butter Caramel, a flavor I try everywhere, this dense concoction with pockets of liquid gold oozing from the otherwise milky sweet ice cream was exceptional and on par in all ways with that of Jeni's back home - potentially even better though a side-by-side would need to be done to be certain.  Moving next to the Blue Cheese - easily a top 5 ice cream moment of all time with the sharp notes of the cheese aptly countered by the sweetness of the honey and the overall texture somewhere between frozen frosting and cheesecake; an absolute must try for anyone living in or visiting the area whether it is 100 degrees or not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Bc4DoKgrKCtCuN-0O5He3A"}

Locally sourced foods prepared by an internationally educated chef and a menu that changes daily (because Dick goes to the market daily for his products) everything about Bona Terra sounded fantastic.\n\nGiven our large lunch and long drive ahead it was decided that we would share a couple of small appetizer plates prior to our mains - and given the fact that neither appetizer required cooking they would arrive quite quickly after our amuse.  Starting first with a cheese plate, Cypress Grove Lamb Chopper with poached Bartlett Pears, Mixed Berry Infused Honey.  Brought forth by the same company who makes my favorite cheese of all time, Humboldt Fog, the Lamb Chopper was described as a sheep's milk Gouda imported from Holland.  Smooth as butter and fragrant without being pungent the fromage was accompanied by impossibly sweet pears, water crackers, local strawberries, and a clover honey blended with what tasted largely of blackberry.  A very well composed plate and a great cheese.\n\nFollowing our appetizers would be a short delay-but a delay with the most unexpected treasure of the night...a bread and butter combo that still leaves me weak in the knees.  Served singly (thank goodness or I'd have invariably eaten ten,) and piping hot from a wooden basket were \"Brioche Rolls and Salted Peach Butter.\"  Warm and buttery on their own the rollswould have been suitable without any topping - but paired with a peachy sweet m\u00e9lange of butter and cream cheese, they were heavenly. All told I ate four...in retrospect I still wish I would have eaten ten.\n\nFor my sister's main - Oven Roasted North Atlantic Cod over Israeli Cous Cous and Sauteed Green Beans, Tarragon Infused Butter-Wine Pan Sauce with Grilled Black Mission Figs.  Having never seen fig meets fish on a single plate I was intrigued by this dish from the start and only moreso when it arrived.  A substantial slice of mild and buttery cod over a toothsome cous-cous and pan-crispy green beans, the fish was topped with a halved plump and juicy Fig clearly soaked in wine and butter while a sweet/savory reduction of butter, wine, and chopped figs circulated the plate.  While the plating, in my opinion, could have been dressed up I'm rather certain the flavoring and quality couldn't have been improved.\n\nWhile my companions' dishes were good mine was unreal - and only improved from the menu listing when Chef Dick informed us that he'd just gotten in a lobe of foie gras and if it \"met his approval\" he'd like to add it to the dish.  Arriving with the smells of cinnamon, cherry, allspice, and thyme the \"chef suggests medium rare\" Seared Maple Leaf farms Duck breast and Hudson Valley Foie Gras over long grain Basmati rice, Sauteed Zucchini, Local Sour Cherry Compote, Sweet and Spicy Tropical Jamaican Jerk Reduction was fantastic.  Smooth and supple with a clean layer of fat ribboned beneath the crispy skin the duck was potentially the best quality duck meat I've ever had.  Topped with a velvet and ample slice of foie gras a presented over a benign rice and vegetal zucchini m\u00e9lange the dish was brought to a peak by the addition of poached black cherries and a reduction that added heat and spice without overwhelming the multiple nuances of the dish.\n\nAfter a meal so stunning dessert was a must - For my sister's selection she targeted the Bavarian Chocolate and Hazelnut Tart with Local Strawberries.  Served in a buttery crust similar to my mothers, Erika's tart would consist of a creamy whipped dark chocolate mousse loaded with what I can only describe as \"Chunky Hazelnut Butter.\"  Something like a \"dark\" Nutella pie the simplisticy of the tart was matched only by its decadence.\n\nFor my dessert the decision was between cheesecake and the dish our server described as the \"house special.\" With everything exceptionally special so far I went with the obvious - a simple and decidedly indulgent Rich Chocolate Cake with Peach Ice Cream.  Served almost like Keller's Bouchon dessert the thick, rich, and warm cake was topped with a large scoop of ice-cream that tasted like a melting peach without the fuzz.  Focusing on the cake-the texture was almost that of a steamed pudding-a little wet, but \"set\" and hefty.\n\nBona Terra was one of those experiences that makes you realize just how good largely unmanipulated fresh fruits, vegetables, and proteins can be when placed in the hands of a skilled chef.  Great food, wonderful service, and a nice location without all the hype and frills - a \"hidden gem.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "aHerF5k5pkMDTdNSpIdTyw"}

Featuring in excess of 15 breads on this particular evening I was unable to taste them all, however the eight I did manage to taste were all remarkably good.  Served throughout the meal each bread was warmed after selection - selections included Pain au Lait, Saffron Forcaccia, Bacon Epi, Gruyere Brioche, French Baguette, Basil Forcaccia, Compte Cheese Bread, and Basil Forcaccia.  While each bread was good, my strongest recommendations would certainly be the Gruyere Brioche and the Basil Forcaccia - both of which tasted like the very essence of their ingredients.\n\nShortly after my bread selection I was brought my amuse bouche - and let me again use the word extravagant.  Le Caviar Osci\u00e8tre en fine gel\u00e9e de corail anis\u00e9e, servie en surprise - an item actually from the menu degustation this wonderful dish consisted of a small tin filled tiny black caviar - high quality and ample in portion with a briny \"pop\" to each pearl served atop a layer of fresh dungeness crab layered in a gelee of lobster coral (lobster eggs) and fennel custard.  Well balanced with the combination of pungent fennel, sweet crab, savory caviar, and a suprisingly large degree of contrast in textures - this \"amuse\" would likely cost over $50 as a menu item in most fine dining establishments.\n\nMy first actual course arrived in very short order - literally a minute after the Caviar which I nursed slowly.  Entitled Oursin, poulpe et crevette dans une infusion en gel\u00e9e vinaigr\u00e9e aux algues the dish featured Sea Urchin, Octopus and Tiger prawn served in three different sections and encased in a seaweed gel\u00e9e.  Smooth and only mildly briny urchin, thin and tender octopus, a perfectly prepared prawn with crispy antenna - each individual bite revealed something different and the gelee was only mildly briny in and of itself.  Cutting the overall salty nature of the dish, the addition of small pieces of poached seaweed, small balls of melon, and various spices lent a nice contrast and everything about the dish (including the crystal bowl) was dazzling.\n\nA supplement off of the degustation ($30 extra when the bill came) was Les Crustac\u00e9s featuring le homard r\u00f4ti au curry et fines graines de chou fleur, l'oursin a la pur\u00e9e de pomme de terre au caf\u00e9 \u00ab Blue Mountain \u00bb torr\u00e9fi\u00e9, la langoustine truff\u00e9e et cuite en ravioli a l'\u00e9minc\u00e9 de chou vert - essentially three distinct courses on a single plate - all a fascinating interplay of flavors and textures.\n \nDesigned to be eaten in order, the first option of the three was one of Robuchon's most famous dishes -  truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage.  Featuring a single plump raviolo filled to bursting with sweet langoustine the dish was paired with chopped Savoy cabbage primed in beurre blanc and the plate was finished with a foie gras and black truffle reduction.  Smooth, creamy, earthy, and unctuous the sauce somewhat blurred the langoustine, but in general the sweetness had no trouble shining through.  While not quite as mind-altering as Achatz's black truffle explosion, the second best piece of pasta I've ever encountered.\n \nSection two of the trio was roasted lobster with green curry.  Not a fan of curry in general I admit this dish gave me pause but a single bite assured me spice would not take the forefront of the dish.  Impaled with a sprig of lemongrass and served over a melange of lemongrass couscous and cauliflower the overall feel of the dish was actually something akin to the vegetal compositions at Manresa.  While I cannot say I \"loved\" this dish, it was good and the lobster itself was perfectly prepared.\n \nThe third selection on the dish was by far the most interesting - Uni on mashed potato with roasted coffee beans.  Featuring the second wonderful uni tongue of the evening served over a bed of truffled mashed potato puree and topped with roasted blue mountain coffee bean foam all I could do was sit back and be wowed - three flavors I'd never consider placing on the same plate, yet perfectly complimenting one another to form an overal taste and texture that (strangely enough) reminded me of a creamy vanilla cappucino at first with the component tastes each peaking through as the spoonfulls traversed the palate.\n\nLe Sucre - Featuring a micrometer thick shell of crystalline sugar enveloping a ball of mascarpone cream, vanilla mousse, lemon marshmallows, and strawberry pop-rocks the dish was topped tableside with pomegranate syrup - it was almost too beautiful to eat.  Cracking the shell and taking a bite of each layer in a single spoonful I was absolutely stunned by the multiple textures, temperatures, flavors, and nuances of the dish...and then the rocks started popping.  One of the five best desserts I've ever tasted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ"}

Topped with banana chips and lime zest the dish was intensely sweet to be certain, but at the same time self assured and balanced when everything was taken together.\n\nLes Banans 2 - the dish would be presented in a long cylindrical glass and the alternating layers would present a parfait of sorts.  With alternating layers of fresh cut banana, house made vanilla wafers, nougat, honeycomb, banana cream, and milk sorbet this dish was perhaps the least \"fussed with\" of the night (aside from the black plate painted with edible gold pain) but the flavors worked perfectly.  Bite by bite, taste by taste, each spoonful offered a totally different taste and sensation.\n\nL'Orange - a light and refreshing citrus dessert featuring orange segments poached in an infusion of Ceylon Pekoe tea at top and bottom.  Between the orange layers would be a thin layer of salty caramel, a bruleed layer of yogurt mousse, a quenelle of orange sorbet, and crunchy bits that tasted like pralines made from macadamia nuts.  Tthe flavor profile was actually quite unique and unexpected with the notes of tea actually substantially smoothing out the citrus and allowing the caramel to shine.\n\nLa Poire - confit anjour pear, foam of almonds and Anisette, pear sorbet.  Largely liquid with small chunks of intensely sweet pear beneath this would be my second dessert with  licorice tones in two days and again it would serve notice that when used with restraint the flavor can be quite pleasant.  With almond top notes and the licorice flavor only present on the palate the dish was a solid palate cleanser for what was next.\n\nLe Chocolat - Comprised as a sort of parfait, the first dish arrived in a cup with a chocolate shell over the top.  Beneath the shell, chocolate wafers, chocolate mousse, chocolate butter cake, chocolate ganache, and winter fruit confit.  Using 66% Valrhona as the based and some lighter chocolates throughout the dish was exactly what the ingredients would dictate - a little citrus, a lot chocolate, and texturally lovely.\n\nLe Chocolat 2 - white chocolate sabayon with lemon confit at the base and add the topping of rich coffee Ice cream, chocolate ribbons, and caramelized walnuts.  Hesitant at first as I don't prefer citrus toned coffees let alone lemon and coffee together, the white chocolate cream actually masked the citrus quite nicely and if anything the lemon actually helped to enhance the more floral notes of the coffee and chocolate combination.\n\nTrolley of mignardises would arrive next with the a selection that included but was not limited to:  Passion fruit marshmallow, salted caramels, confit ginger covered with chocolate, chocolate dome, dark truffle with mint, chocolate covered orange peel, liquid caramel centered chocolate, pinapple pate a fruit, white chocolate bark with puffed rice and orange, a chouxcette, strawberry cheesecake in white chocolate, tuile of almond and citrus, pear gelee filled with brandy, blackberry opera cake, chocolate religieux, blueberry financier, dry pineapple with white chocolate, raspberry praline, canele, white nougat, and at least 15 other selections.  Choices made I'll note the while the canele was a bit soft, the financier, opera cake, pear gelee, and cheesecake were all sublime.\n\nAmazing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ"}

Having already dined at Joel Robuchon twice myself this was not the first time I'd seen such generosity from the kitchen of \"The Chef of the Century\" and much like my previous visits the meal was an exercise in refinement; the room, the food, and the service all well-manicured, highly polished, and lavish.\n\nTaking a 9:00pm reservation and arriving early only to be identified by name as the doors swung open on my approach I was subsequently seated at the same table I'd dined at during my first visit and greeted by a familiar service team including the same dining room manager and server as my prior visit much of what would follow was familiar; the plethoric bread cart and equally impressive cheese course followed by a dessert trolley with nearly three dozen options plus the signature pound cake, though this time smaller than prior.  Deferring on coffee I was additionally treated to a hand clipped tea and infusions cart and a $10 flat charge brought no less than three bottles of Evian - no doubt the cost of admission warrants these things as well as the impressive \"Ruby\" palate cleanser and \"Maize\" amuse - gifts that would constitute proper courses at many restaurants.\n\nMoving on to what was ordered I once again opted to order from the prix fixe as opposed to the larger grand tasting and making a special request for the (menu price $300 if ordered ALC) Pintade Fermiere my only small complaint regarding the entire evening was that Chef Le Tohic felt need to visit my table before the hen's preparation to suggest I'd be better off only ordering half the bird as I'd have gladly (and greedily,) eaten more of the crispy skin and supple flesh sandwiched around thick, buttery, foie gras...though I guess saving the $60 supplement charge was a benefit.\n\nTruffles, foie gras, uni, foie gras, caviar, and more foie gras plus aged comte, spell-binding desserts, and a room and service beyond reproach I can think of much worse ways to celebrate Christmas Eve than with Joel Robuchon's team at the MGM and although I personally would never do so in a T-shirt there is something refreshing about the fact that in a city where there are so many bad high-stakes bets this is a place where anyone willing and able to spend the money is virtually guaranteed an excellent return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ"}

Friendly but busy one of the men broke away from his work to take our order and after a moment weighing the options I decided to make it easy - half a dozen (2 of each flavor) plus a block of cream cheese - and settling the modest tab made my way to the street as there is no place to sit at St. Viateur.\n\nWith the bag toasty warm in my hand and the smell of dough and yeast still fresh in my nares it would not be long after emerging to the streets before we opened up the bag and with my mother and aunt preferring a schmear  (Philadelphia Cream Cheese - nothing special) I went with my tastes plain and tasting each in succession I was adequately impressed by the slight crunch of the exterior giving way to a supple chew within, but still not 'wowed.'  Semi-sweet and certainly different from any other bagel I've tasted before or since I particularly enjoyed the Sesame Seed option while the Poppy Seed and Plain were equally well textured but not as interestingly flavored.  Certainly understanding the simple bagel's cultural importance and the fact that St. Viateur seems to be everything right what I'll take away most from my visit was the experience of watching the bakers at work - in the end it just seems I'm not a bagel guy, no matter how good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "udjYDN0FvSs6bNGXb7Ppcw"}

Having visited the day prior only to find them out of everything but a few loaves of bread plus various sandwich fixings and charcuterie we returned early morning a few days later to find a larger selection with some interesting pies and tartes plus two croissants I had to try, one almond and one maple...of course bearing in mind the large market style layout of Le Fromentier ordering these two pastries was easier said than done since the bakers were at work and the cashier had apparently 'stepped out for a moment,' but after a short wait my items were bagged and ready to go.\n\nHaving spent time browsing the sandwiches, charcuterie, foie gras, and unique beverages at Le Fromentier I was excited to try the baked goods and with each item shaped more like a traditional butter croissant than like an almond or filled croissant the texture too was unexpected as the almond seemed the dantier of the two but was actually filled with far too much slightly artificial tasting flavor creating a sticky mouthfeel while the maple was graced with a thin smear of cream both inside and out creating a sort of 'frosted' butter croissant.  With the exterior crackling and the interior of each appropriately buttery with good separation between the layers I think it is simply a case of personal preference that the texture was a little too wet for me, even if the maple cream version was quite subtle and pleasant.  I wager a simple butter croissant would have been quite good, particularly if it were warm - perhaps even with a bit of maple cream on the side as opposed to being added and allowed to sit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wj40DIDcL_rBBouhb6NXdg"}

Helmed by Normand Laprise and focused strongly on local sourcing with a daily menu meant to focus on items most fresh, unique, and dazzling from the local markets I will admit I'd heard some mixed feelings on recent visits to the restaurant, but with my mother and aunt planning to save room for what was sure to be a gluttonous evening the large formal dining room seemed like a perfect place to lunch amongst the city's well-heeled and well dressed.\n \n\nThe Space:  Large and spacious with high ceilings, soft wall coverings, blond wood, and plush carpet Toque feels very serious and aside from the large metal flower marker out front it certainly is a serious restaurant with widely set tables, servers speaking in whispers, and a wine cellar focused on Canada but inclusive of all the best - many visible on a floating rack in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nThe Service:  All female during my visit and all friendly, efficient, and professional.  Perfect posture, peerless pours, and plates delivered with ample description were the norm throughout my visit and ever-present but never looming there is no doubt the team here is well trained.  More Paris than New York I will say that I am generally more comfortable with servers who show a little more personality, but all things being equal it would be hard to find fault in the team at Toque.\n\nBread Service:  Served in a small box with an icy puck of bland butter a trio of breads featuring a Sourdough Roll, Carraway Rye slices, and Crostini arrived first - each was fine, but the butter was largely inedible until it had rested a good twenty minutes; a pet peeve of mine.\n\nQuinoa Salad, Squab Confit, Iceberg Lettuce, Dried Fruit:  I really don't know why I was being served iceberg lettuce in a fine dining space, but I have to say I appreciated the honesty as thin strings stood alongside razor thin radishes atop a truly impressive warm salad of toothsome quinoa, crisp and fatty squab, plus dried peaches, apricots, and plums.  A deft balance of sweet, savory, and nutty this was one of those dishes that far exceeded modest expectations handily.\n\nQuail Confit, Brandy Sauce, Eggplant Caviar, Garlic Puree, Cabbage, Parsnip and Beet Chips:  More fowl, and this one more substantial in portion, it would be hard to imagine a more juicy bird than the whole quail set before me.  Reportedly baked in duck fat for nearly half a day and plated with vegetables in varying forms, flavors, and texture the quail itself was perfect and each accoutrement helped lead the plate in a new direction, yet unfortunately where this dish came up short for me was in the sauce - a potent reduction that threatened to overwhelm nearly everything it touched.  As an added note - crispy cabbage leaves only seem like a good idea; in reality they shatter with even the slightest touch of a fork and would have been better served as finger food.\n\nWith coffee supplied by Illy I went with an Americano and oddly it was brought out before my cheese course - but cheers to the folks at Toque, the refills were free and thus I was able to enjoy a few cups, including one with dessert, rather than suffer cool coffee.\n\nRiopelle with Sweet Almonds, Apple Jelly, Onion Bread:  At $8 per selection the cheese board at Toque is well culled but largely international and wanting to try something local my server directed me to this - the best cheese of the trip without a doubt and seemingly uncommon in the world of Canadian cheeses in that it was quite soft, nearly liquid in the mouth.  Triple cream and intense on the first taste with a lot of fruity and earthy notes coming forth later I've since sought this out at home and also found the accoutrements to be superlative - who knew apple jam spread on onion bread could work so well?\n\nChurros, Chocolate, Coffee Sauce:  My fault.  I have no idea why I ordered this at a place like Toque other than the fact that the other dessert options did not sound very good either.  Overcooked, over-sugared, and although the coffee sauce was good the execution was not.  Again, I don't know why I ordered it or why it was on the menu.\n\nThe Verdict:  All things being equal I think I may have cheated myself by visiting Toque at lunch - a quick glance at the dinner menu all but confirms that, but considering their stature in the Canadian culinary landscape I guess I expected a bit more of a \"yes\" attitude to something as simple as a cold foie gras prep at lunch - particularly as the restaurant was less than 1/8 full throughout my visit.  Great service, beautiful room, but aside from the quinoa salad and a cheese that can be bought elsewhere nothing truly 'wowed' me enough to say I'd go back or recommend it to others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v-w9fF91VUFwuCbVc3atUA"}

No stranger to early arrivals for great food but not particularly sold on the Eggs Benny-centric menu (apparently not as ubiquitous in Montreal as in the United States) we waxed and waned on L'Avenue until the last minute and in the end, after a very late night at APdC we decided \"why not?\" and arrived thirty minutes after they opened the doors.\n\nA hip restaurant - long and narrow with reclaimed wood and spray-painted exposed brick plus vinyl, motorcycles, and oddly positioned manikins the dominant features aside from a long bar and partially open kitchen - our arrival at L'Avenue would be met by a largely open dining room with perhaps only three tables already seated and greeted at the door by a young woman who's English was only slightly worse than my French we were led quickly to a table near the front where Vinyl-album style menus (French only) were provided and drink orders were placed - deux caf\u00e9 et une lait - the former acrid, luke warm, and rarely refilled while the later was first delivered as caf\u00e9 au lait and later completely forgotten until the server was reminded...not a good start.\n\nSeated and listening to the music overhead as I translated the menu for my mother and aunt it would be some time before our server returned and after the drink order we set to simply pointing out our options on the menu to be sure all went well - a successful strategy as it would turn out, though it would take twenty minutes before she returned to inform me that the poutine I'd selected could not be ordered until after 10am and another fifteen minutes thereafter before our plates would arrive along with an unexpected $1.50 side of bacon that no one knowingly ordered (and was subsequently removed from our bill after speaking with an older woman who explained to us that our server was 'new'.)\n\n Moving on to the reason we'd originally selected L'Avenue, namely the food, the humor of the previous day's fail extended on when my aunt's mixed fruit pancakes turned out even worse than those at Beauty's and although the Blueberries, Strawberries, and Banana all proved fresh and tasty the cakes themselves were not only doughy but shockingly dry to the point of nearly being inedible.  Again refusing to utilize any maple syrup (I'm rather certain a blend rather than being pure) despite the fact that these 'cakes were clearly in need all we could do was laugh - another fail from the only person I know to have ordered dry pancakes at Hollywood's Griddle Caf\u00e9 this disaster simply seemed appropriate.\n\nMoving on to the bigger and better things, my mother's selection of Caramel Banana Crepes served with a fruit skewer would prove to be a good choice while also surprisingly light as the dainty crepe was doubled over and folded around raw bananas lightly tinged with warm salty caramel.  Again paired with an accompaniment of high quality fruit despite the later winter/early spring I particularly enjoyed the toothsome whole wheat texture of the crepes, though I think we'd have all preferred the bananas to at least be warmed.\n\nFor my selection, without doubt the most decadent of the group, Chocolate, Caramelized Pear, and Maple Caramel Pancakes would arrive with the same lackluster texture of my aunt's selection but with an ample layer of Belcolade bittersweet chocolate disks, saut\u00e9ed pears, and a half-cup of buttery pear jus mixed with maple syrup and salty caramel over top there was no semblance of 'dry' on this plate, just a whole lot of richness and a distinct lack of subtlety where a little went a long way; the best item of a nearly $45 breakfast after tax and tip where the only real 'highlight' was the bathroom - a really cool bathroom - but not a bathroom warranting a $15/pp admission price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7lSQXiyPGrtfnCg8ym1Kmg"}

Certainly the most pricey coffee I've ever purchased in whole bean form and saved for home, first via Chemex and then via French Press I will admit that the flavor was sublime - a truly complete roast with surprising sweetness, low acidity, and aromatics that bordered of floral when made via pour over and allowed to bloom a bit but even better when pressed - a nearly creamy taste on the palate that I'd place in the top two or three cups of coffee I've ever brewed at home (though perhaps not the best despite being the most expensive.)

Kissed with a top note of truffle and with slices of raw criminis tossed in for more texture this was where the bread really shined and both bowls returned to the kitchen spotless.\n\nDuck Foie Gras Au Torchon, Grilled Brioche, Peppered Pineapple: As much as I like dressed up foie gras preparations there is nothing quite like a nice naked torchon from a high quality bird and at LeMeac the Quebecoise product shined with a slight mineral undertone coursing through the smooth liver and beautifully cut by sea salt and fruit.  Served with only one brioche roll, split and grilled, my request for two more was granted without question, the smooth liver melting on the heated bread before melting on my tongue.\n\nCrab Cake, gribiche sauce and cucumbers with peppers: While I cannot explain my aunt's obsession with ordering crab cakes in even the most unlikely places this was actually a very good preparation from the restaurant's appetizer section and certainly large enough to suffice as a main course considering our day's agenda.  Dense yet fluffy and sweet with just a bit of spice the cake was low on both filler and frying oil while the salad of thinly sliced cucumbers was a great counterpoint.\n\nPanko crusted goat cheese, apple and walnut salad: Another appetizer for main course selection, my mother too went with a lightly fried option and as good as the crabcake was, this creamy puck of chevre was even better as it was warm but not gooey throughout and equally good spread on bread or taken with the salad and nuts.\n\nDuck leg confit, roasted fingerling potatoes and salad: Rustic as can be with perfect crunchy skin overlying supple flesh from just down the road at Mariposa Farm there really is not much more to be said about this confit; it was textbook and every bit as good as the oft raved version at Chez Dumonet in Paris...and as a matter of fact, my appetizer/main sequence at both restaurants were identical and all things being equal I'd be hard pressed to decide which I preferred.\n\nLemon Curd Tartlette with lime coulis: Moving on to dessert, this was clearly my mother's choice and with the citrus nicely smoothed out by the sugar and egg yolks this creamy tart was quite nice, the sort of thing served at any number of Parisian bistros and nicely encircled by a rich butter crust.\n\nBanana and Date Sticky Toffee Pudding, Vanilla Ice Cream:  The next dessert, my own selection, would prove to be the richest of the trio and with a dense cake of steamed pudding centered in a puddle of caramel sauce it was also one of the sweetest desserts I have ever tasted with the fructose notes of both the dates and the banana coming through with aplomb and only partially tempered by the rich ice cream; definitely a dessert to order with coffee and a few other people to share.\n\nFrench Toast, Milk Jam Ice Cream, Maple Caramel: They say a picture is worth a thousand words and in this case it is probably also worth a thousand or more calories - simply stated, if you go to LeMeac you must order this.  Impossibly light despite the enormous portion, piping hot only to be cooled and saturated by an ice cream harkening the flavors of condensed milk, and more than enough to satisfy a group...a signature dessert to be sure.\n\nThe Verdict:  A French bistro hitting the same highs as many of the best in Paris there really is not much else to be said about LeMeac; from the menu to the service to the execution of the food everything was on point and although perhaps not the most unique meal of the trip certainly one of the most enjoyable, particularly for someone who measures the quality of French cuisine by foie, duck, and pastry.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UW9q_26cX8fKqtO28n78AQ"}

Manned by two bakers and a young woman serving as the hostess and cashier it was not long after I entered that I was asking in French, then in fluent English if I knew what I wanted and deferring to allow others to proceed I browsed the options largely to wait for a the last slice of the restaurant's namesake to be packed up so a new, fresh one would be procured from the wire racks; at that point I stepped forward and placed my order for the two items I'd come for plus a third selection at the young woman's suggestion.\n\nWith each item packed in brown paper and a modest tab of two toonies and a loonie paid I stepped into the street to enjoy my items and beginning first with the item suggested by the server I nearly went back inside to buy more as the Raspberry Custard Danish would prove to be the best Danish I've ever had - a flaky butter pastry stuffed with rich vanilla custard at its center plus a half-dozen ruby colored berries and a dusting of powdered sugar.  Soft and dense but with a light crackle along the edges plus soft hints of butter and cream melding with the slightly tart raspberries - it was remarkable to put it lightly.\n\nMoving next to my selections, well, when an outstanding almond croissant isn't the best pastry of the day you know you ordered right.  Beginning first with the croissant, a double-baked beauty loaded with sliced toasted almonds and a light dusting of powdered sugar, it was perhaps the messiest version of the pastry I've ever tasted as it shattered with each bite releasing crumbs, almonds, and sugar in plethora.  With a soft center rife with butter and only a kiss of frangipane it was divine - I almost went back for another.  \n\nFor the final bite - the signature Kouign Amann, but this time different from those I'd experienced prior as the large butter pastry was actually a cheese-like wheel subsequently cut into slices with a crackling caramelized top and bottom surrounding what essentially tasted like butter and sugar suspended in air.  Light and perfect, texturally complex, and still warm - if you live within a roadtrip of Montreal this is reason enough to go (amongst so many others.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "MA0czhKN4y3W5huLd6unIg"}

With the menu larger than anticipated but the object of our desire displayed prominently the order was placed and asking if we preferred \"fatty\" or \"medium\" I suggested he give us whatever was better and he said \"medium\" before turning to a younger man who prepped and wrapped the sandwich, grabbed a can of Canada Dry, and bagged it for us to pay another young man at the door - the whole interaction took perhaps five minutes before we emerged on the street.\n\nMoving on to the sandwich - three quarters of a pound at least, if I were to guess - I have a little bit of trouble describing exactly what I ate because I really have no reference standard, but with a touch of mustard largely avoided and sampling both the brisket on its own and with the rye bread I have to say it was actually quite good - a supple mouth feel with big notes of smoke complimented by what I believe was mostly peppercorn and coriander plus a slight sweetness that worked nicely with the rye.  While certainly not something I'd crave on a daily basis definitely a worthy place to check out - particularly as the remaining sandwich and a few bagels from down the street served a more than ample dinner costing less than $10 for my mother and aunt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SHfUGBOznEtDhK6WbVrvIw"}

Beginning first with the eggy bread - crisp on the shell with a wispy and rich pull-apart within and lightly kissed with an egg wash before its trip to the oven both curls were rife with their respective ingredients and as much as I love Valrhona dark it was the cheesecake that impressed most - a rich balance of the cream cheese's smoothness with sweet pureed raspberries complete with seeds.\n\nMoving on to the measuring stick, an oblong almond croissant, I found myself somewhat less impressed than I had expected largely due to the texture produced by such a tightly wound crumb.  Certainly tinged with almond and packed with butter this simply was not the texture I would expect for a croissant - more like a breadstick in its lack of an air-pocketed leavened crumb.  Good, but not on par with the rest of the choices, including the Chausson Aux Pommes sharing its basket.  Translated literally as 'slipper of apples' it would be hard for me to find something more comforting than this hand-pie and no matter what language the crispy golden shell and dense core of pan cooked cinnamon apples was lovely - the only thing that would have made it better was ice, or perhaps whipped, cream.\n\nFor our final choice, the only kitchen item that screamed 'must order' we received the \"Poached Egg on Your Face Sandwich\" - a pressed panini made with house ciabatta filled with sauteed onions, a thick curl of aged Comte, confit tomatoes, griddled speck, and 'cooked egg salad.'  Hitting on pretty much all of the savory notes with the caramelized onions and bright tomatoes acting to cut the fat just a bit the most intriguing aspect of this dish to me was the 'salad' - a texture somewhere between rough chopped hardboiled eggs and a lightly poached egg but very interesting on the tongue.  A great meal from first sip to last bite with only a slightly disappointing almond croissant to mar the experience I definitely understand the hype around Olive + Gourmando and compared to our other Montreal Breakfasts it is the only one to which I'd return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5nTvNRLnpeFKd6r0X2af3w"}

Knowing full well that my family does not have the same appreciation for haute-French as I, Chef Marc De Canck's take on provincial French seemed to strike a good balance between accessible and refined and with a convenient location on L'Avenue Laurier and a \"business casual\" lunch compared to the \"jackets suggested\" dinner destination I made a reservation for noon on a Monday.\n\nThe food:\n\nOregano Potato Bread, Nuts and Grains Bread, Cows Milk Butter and Fleur de Sel:  Complements of the house, served piping hot, and replenished without request the \"nuts and grains\" bread was as good as many pain au cereal in Paris while the potato bread was light, aromatic, and airy.\n\nDuo de Foie Gras de Canard / pain d'epices, puree de coing, gelee d'abricots:  My obvious choice, and a wonderful one at that, this presentation of Palmex Farm's fatted duck liver was presented both seared and en terrine.  With the warm preparation served over spiced bread quince puree and the creamy chilled portion topped with a thin piece of golden bread and brown sugar crumble there was nothing particularly elaborate about this dish, just high quality ingredients paired beautifully, the sweet cutting the fat and the aromatics perfuming the palate.\n\nFilet de Proc Fume / Polenta, Courgettes, Moutarde: My plat principal, this dish was suggested as our waitress' favorite and a chef's signature with good reason.  Again quite rustic in its construction but featuring an ample cut of lean pork loin smoked and placed over toothsome polenta tinged with mustard seeds the highlight of this dish was actually the jus - a pan reduction of bacon, zucchini, and cocoa that fit somewhere between sweet and savory thus working well to meld the pork and polenta without overpowering either.\n\nOnglet de Boeuf Angus / Salsifis, Choux de Bruxelles, Champignons:  A surprising order for my mother who rarely orders beef this was another hearty dish that would have fit nicely on any French bistro menu as the tender Alberta sourced hanger steak was cooked to medium well served over a sort of confit of Brussels sprouts and salsify with lightly pickled at the side.  With mom focusing on the steak, dense and aromatic with just a touch of smoke and char I particularly appreciated the sprouts - caramelized but still pungent and a good foil to the richness of the protein.\n\nRisotto vert-pre / Epinards, Edamamaes, Courgettes:  At first I thought my aunt was truly puzzled by my translation from French, but assuring us she wanted the vegetarian offering of the afternoon I must say it turned out quite nicely with the Carnaroli rice cooked to a medium tenderness in a creamy reduction of mushrooms and peas before being garnished with chopped zucchini, shelled edemame, and shredded spinach.  Rich, vegetal, and substantial in portion the dish was anything but light but considering I rarely associate risotto with French cooking I was rather impressed.\n\nPetit Basque Sheep's Cheese with Caramelized Nuts, Apricots, Grilled Bread: Listed only as a cheese plate on the menu this one was a bit of a letdown for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love Petit Basque, especially when nicely aged as this one was - but being in Montreal I couldn't help but hope for a local cheese and while the accoutrements were nice it just wasn't what I'd anticipated at a $6 supplement.\n\nChocolate Profiteroles with sliced almonds:  A second bummer on the dessert menu were the profiteroles ordered by my mother - two small balls of admittedly nice choux pastry encompassing rather bland vanilla ice cream but thankfully topped with dense melted chocolate.  While admittedly not a fan of profiteroles to begin with the almonds were a nice touch, but not enough to save the plate.\n\nValrhona Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and Pineapple Mango Salsa, Caramel:  Another $6 supplemental dessert this one would actually prove to be worth the time, calories, and money. Beginning first with the cake - sticky, dense, and cooked to the perfect point to maintain the liquid center this oft duplicated dessert poured forth the dense 72% chocolate in plethora and although expectedly bitter the cocoa met an ample foil in the intense vanilla bean ice cream, sweet salsa and caramel, plus brown sugar crumble.\n\nThe Verdict:  In the end I liked La Chronique well enough; the setting is lovely, the service excellent, and the prices fair for the quality (and more so the portions) given, but in comparison to the rest of our dining in  Montreal it was largely unmemorable.  A nice spot to enjoy a leisurely lunch or romantic dinner they certainly have the skills to make a classic French meal - I guess I'd just hoped for more creativity and better desserts given the cost of admission and supplements.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xk4FO3d4cn3ymMN9uIqNGA"}

Admittedly a fan of fine dining with an agenda that otherwise included Quebecois staples of poutine, pigs feet, and as much maple syrup as I could find Europea seemed a perfect choice for my one solo night in Montreal - a good reason for the suit and tie as opposed to the Patrick Roy jersey, at the very least.\n\nThe Service:  Whether it was my inability to speak French, the fact that I only ordered one glass of wine, or an effect of the fact that there was a large (14 or so) table of regulars seated directly behind me I will simply say that the service at Europea was lacking.  Twenty minute waits between courses, water unfilled for long periods of time, bread service unreplenished, and an inexplicable twenty minute wait at the end of the meal where not a single server walked within fifteen feet of my table (aside from up and down the stairs) to check in, refill coffee, or offer the bill.  I was an island of one in the dead-center of the restaurant for the majority of my visit - something I've never experienced at such a restaurant and hope to never experience again.  It was mentioned to the manager when I asked to see the kitchen at the end of the evening - he blew me off with an \"oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n\nThe Food:  $100 tasting menu, one $19 glass of ice wine, complementary canapes, amuses, mignardises, bread service, $4.50 coffee.\n\nCalamari - Tagliatelle of Calamari Carbonara:  With many chefs making squid noodles and turning everything into a haute carbonara I'll simply say this dish could have fallen way short for me, but in fact it was probably the best of the night in terms of innovation and execution as the tender squid was nearly indistinguishable from al dente pasta while the use of a poached Quail Egg, squid ink and garlic butter croutons, and lemon 'caviar' all melded into a bright and balanced sauce - I could have eaten a giant bowl of this and left happy.\n\nFoie Gras - Maple:  In a trip filled with fatty fowl liver this was probably the most memorable in terms of 'wow' factor as a thick slice of the lobe arrive previously smoked over maple wood and seared on one side only to be placed on a hot river stone tableside and doused with ice wine allowing it to caramelize under a glass dome as I watched and enjoyed a tasty cloudberry canale meant to 'whet the palate.\"  Smoky and unctuous, sweet with a crystalline crust giving way to supple fat - I'd be hard pressed to name five better foie preparations in the last five years.\n\nRaviole - Fresh organic-herb ravioli stuffed porcini mushrooms:  Never afraid to serve up the bold flavors, this plate was the very essence of the earth and a perfect lead in to the final savory.  Featuring \"Seared Mushrooms picked by Mr Roberts\" including a woodsy cascade of Enoki, Shitake, Morels, Honshimiji, and Trumpets served alongside thin noodles stuffed with truffled Enoki puree the dish was completed with buttery morel mushroom froth with the smell greeting you at 10 feet and the flavor every bit as powerful; this plate also returned to the kitchen without a spot. \n\nThe Verdict:  With the previously mentioned service flaws frequently marring the otherwise excellent cuisine and my comments about this blown off by the manager clearly tempering my feelings about a return to Europea I have to admit that on the whole the cuisine was quite goodt and at less than $100 before tax/tip (and converting to the US Dollar) Europea would not be out of place amongst the Michelin 1-Star restaurants of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco.  Certainly a bit of attention to detail would be welcomed, but taking into consideration the ravioli, squid noodles, and foie gras I cannot deny that the meal was a memorable one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-vYXWPTZQ_XI3UZ2IyZ00Q"}

Having garnered national attention after a visit from David Chang and subsequently releasing a cookbook appropriately titled \"Art of Living According to Joe Beef\" I knew it would be my kind of place - I just hoped the chalkboard menu could appease the picky palates of my mother and aunt.\n\nThe Space:  It's a bar - it is tight, it is cramped, it is full of odds n' ends, nick-nacks, trinkets, and even the bathroom is used for storage space.  Apparently only originally 35 seats and subsequently expanded to 70 the stools/chairs are hard and they seat you where they can - in our case at a \"3-top\" booth in the window.  Really, it's pretty awesome, but when it is full it is Loud with a capital L.\n\nThe Service:  Is \"hipster formal\" a service style?  It is now.  Much like the folks at Publican in Chicago or the Chang spots in New York these waiters, decked out in plaid and 5 o'clock shadow know the menu, the preparations, and the chef's vision without hesitation.  Recommendations flow freely, cautionary tales of \"ordering too much\" are given (and ignored,) and although his accent was thick our server's English was flawless - a must on the all-French Chalkboard menu.  \n\nCornflake Eel Nuggets with BBQ, Mustard, Tartar:  As anticipated, my aunt had a lot of difficulty with the appetizer portion of menu but wanting to make sure we experienced the best of what Joe Beef had to offer I took the liberty of ordering the first round for the table; three items with this as the centerpiece.  Served as a half-dozen, intense and creamy with that unctuous undertone that few things save for eel can offer, this should definitely be a must order for anyone making the visit.  Sweet without being sweetened, fatty without being 'greasy', and particularly excellent with the barbeque sauce - with the ladies unwilling to try I gladly ate all six.\n\nParfait de Foie Gras, Cherry Brioche, Truffles:  3.5 ounces of creamy duck liver whipped with black truffles served beneath a piping hot piece of buttery brioche loaded with maraschino cherries; it was every bit as good as it sounds and although I had to wait for a second piece of brioche I was glad to do so.  Like most things at Joe Beef this was probably best shared-but it wasn't.\n\nFoie Gras Double Down:  The second half of my main course was probably Joe Beef's most famous item and clearly poking fun at KFC's abomination of a sandwich Joe Beef takes the concept to a whole different level by replacing chicken with two thick slices of duck foie gras that are butermilk brined and breaded prior to a trip to the deep-fryer and wrapping them around aged cheddar and sliced bacon.  Loosely wrapped in aluminum foil and drizzled with pure maple syrup, sriracha, plus a bit of garlic and Old Bay infused mayonnaise the sandwich was much like everything else at Joe Beef, brash and unapologetic but at the same time nuanced and subtly sophisticated.\n\nLobster Spaghetti:  The recipe goes a little something like this - A 1.25 lb. lobster, 0.25 lb. house made spaghetti, 2 slices diced bacon, 3 Tbsp Brandy, 0.25 cup peas, 0.25 cup 35% cream, 0.25 cup half-and-half cream, salt, pepper, chopped chives.  The pasta is al dente, the lobster is snappy and sweet, and the sauce is the very definition of decadence - at $49 it is the most expensive item on the menu, but apparently also the most ordered...and for good reason.\n\nPistachio Financier - Maple Ice Cream:  I was told by a friend that while APdC's desserts are 'hit and miss' I should definitely save room for those at Joe Beef. Beginning first with one of the two 'larger' desserts my photos really don't do justice to how big this cake was, but at nearly eight inches in diameter and probably a half inch thick it was great - a thick sponge with great tooth already saturated with butter and almond paste but eager to soak up the creamy maple syrup and ice cream while pistachio granola added more texture.  Always happy to overindulge in desserts this was exactly my 'style' - a standout of the trip.\n\nThe Verdict:  The place is loud, audacious, and cramped while the food is equally brazen and uncompromised but with servers that love their job and chefs who know the basics well enough to nail them yet also  know themselves well enough to take chances there is a whole lot to love about Joe Beef.  While some may say it is derivative of APdC I personally couldn't imaging visiting Montreal again without dining at both because although the cuisine shares some similarity each is an entirely unique experience - Picard's space a self-proclaimed \"bastion of excess\" while McMillan and Morin's restaurant puts less emphasis on the audacity of each dish and more on experiencing their \"Art of Living\" inclusive of food, service, and setting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tK9gTB4bj4Z-iQ1daqkK7w"}

Good, not great.  Highlights below.\n\nThe Why:  The Number One hotel in Canada according to some sources - Five Diamonds, Relais et Chateau Rated, an off-the-beaten path gem, and an ever changing menu crafted by Chef Jonathan Gushue focused on the best local ingredients available - it seemed a perfect way to end our trip spanning from Toledo to Montreal and back.\n\nThe Service:  Elegant and formal but decidedly lacking the polish and charm of many similar restaurants I was actually somewhat surprised by the fact that only a single captain and server were working the room that evening.  Perhaps an effect of the season or low number of diners there were periods where water went unfilled, plates sat empty, and presentations were bobbled that I simply would not expect from a restaurant of such stature.\n\nLavender White Hot Chocolate:  Generally not a fan of floral flavors this was highly recommended by our server and actually quite excellent, a light perfume of lavender with rich smooth sipping chocolate.\n\nDressed Rabbit with duck liver mousse and Endive:  In my opinion the best bite of the evening, this complementary amuse was perfect - the lean tartare of rabbit melded together by the creamy foie gras while endive and crisp onions kept it vibrant.\n\nHouse White and Wheat Bread with Salted Aged Butter:  A top ten all time bread service, particularly considering there was only two options - the quality here was in the butter.  Rich and decadent - literally as flavorful as an aged cheese and as good as many in Paris I really have no idea how much of this I ate, but I do know the bread was replenished twice and the butter thrice...and I don't think the ladies were responsible.\n\nPotato Fondue, Basil, Herb Chips, Sallers:  This was awesome - probably more butter than potato and beautifully accented with the herbal elements while the crispy root vegetables added texture.\n\nLobster, Partridgeberry Jus, Baby Beets, Parsnip, Red Onion, Rainbow Chard:  My aunt's selection and everything the cod tongue could have been - perfectly executed lobster in a vegetal melange that reminded me of the cuisine out in northern California in terms of its freshness, refinement, and balance.  At times bitter, at others earthy, but all the time with a slight overlying sweetness that played off the natural flavors of the shellfish.\n\nRoe Deer, Chickweed, Venison Bacon, Navet, Mustard Greens, Sunflower Crumble, Natural Jus:  My selection - served medium-rare by Chef's choice - was small in portion but impressively lean and perfectly gamey, but even cooked perfectly still a bit dry.  Having bathed other proteins in sauces and broths it is hard for me to determine why Gushue opted to go with largely dry accoutrements on this plate given the natural leanness of small deer but all-in-all it was a poor choice, particularly at a $44 price tag.\n\nDark Chocolate Toffee Bar with Coco Nibs, Soused Cherry Ice Cream:  By far the best of the desserts that afternoon, this was dry like a Kit-Kat yet melted like a semifreddo on the tongue.  Bittersweet but bolstered by the intensely sour ice cream everything here from temperature to texture to taste was nicely balanced.\n\nPine Scented Lemon Sponge Cake with Toasted Marshmallow and Citrus Frozen Yogurt:  My mother ordered this for the citrus...she enjoyed it.  To me it tasted much like Pine-sol smells.  Texturally interesting to be sure, but most assuredly not my style.\n\nThe Verdict:  In many ways befitting of its tremendous accolades I couldn't help but depart Langdon Hall a bit disappointed.  For many reasons a 'destination meal,' including location, sourcing, and setting the simple fact of the matter was that for over $100/pp after tax and tip there were just too many uninspiring courses at too much cost.  While I don't doubt that both the front of the house and Chef Gushue's team in the kitchen can turn out an exemplary experience at Langdon Hall it would be hard for me to guarantee it to anyone based on my one experience and even harder for me to justify a return visit unless I otherwise found myself in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xQnZpvPqop1ZMXpAimb_Dg"}

Owned and operated by Martin Picard Au Pied de Cochon had been on my food bucket list for almost as long as a trip to see Les Habitants for obvious reasons...I just hoped my mother and picky aunt could find something on the menu they'd like.\n \nThe Reservation:  Having made mention of this above I'll admit the plan was a little convoluted, but it worked out perfectly - one reservation at 5:00pm for appetizers and entrees, a second reservation at 10:30pm for dessert, coffee, and maybe more.  I knew we'd overeat.  I was okay with this.\n\nThe Space:  Located on what is essentially a side street amongst other stores and eateries the wooded exterior of APdC is quite unassuming and arriving early parking was a cinch.  With doors unlocked we were the first to arrive and given our choice of seats we opted for a spot up front near the window of the long and narrow space.  Wooden and rustic with an open kitchen spanning nearly the entirety of the space up to a long bar in back the only thing \"formal\" about the space is the linen napkins and stemware - the rest feels like a cozy cabin and a tribute to many things Canadian.  \n\nThe Service:  Superlative.  From watching Chef Picard himself haul in a large case of Foie Gras and innumerable loaves of bread before stopping by to say hello to our primary server, a young blonde woman, everyone just seemed happy to be at Au Pied de Cochon - an atmosphere that was entirely in harmony with the food and extended from front of the house to the back both at 5:00pm and again at 10:30.  With both the standard menu and a list of eight specials described at length and our time constraints noted with regard to preparation and presentation  it would be hard to ask for better service than what we received at APdC - it was Michelin Star quality.\n\nThe Food:  Complimentary Bread and Butter, House Muddled Strawberry Lemonade, Six Appetizers, Two Entrees, Three Desserts, and Coffee.\n\nFresh Bread with House butter:  I have no idea where Picard gets his bread but they bring it in by the bushel and served up warm with unsalted butter the only challenge was not to eat too much.  A crusty French baguette with good crunch and better chew plus a bit of salinity juxtaposing yeasty notes this was as good as much of the bread service in Paris.\n\nFoie gras cromesquis:  Think of these as liquid foie gras nuggets.  Order them.  Eat them.  Bask in the gluttony.\n\nTomato Tart:  Knowing my aunt would struggle with the meat-centric menu I also knew this would be right up her ally and as much as it may seem odd to order such a thing at Au Pied de Cochon I would strongly recommend it.  Essentially nothing more than a buttery puff pastry topped with herbs, olive oil, a bit of gruyere, and incredibly fresh tomatoes the tart was acidic and bright yet creamy and balanced plus big enough to share and probably enough to serve as a meal for some.\n\nFrench Onion Soup:  Another order fitting my aunt's palate, though certainly not traditional, was this pork and lard based French Onion soup. Generally not a fan of the classic form of this dish I think I actually enjoyed this dish the most of anyone at the table as the swine based broth was thick and full - almost like that of ramen - with plenty of fatty pork and root vegetables beneath the bubbling dome of cheese.  Great on its own and more-so when used for dipping bread this is another great choice for those not wanting one of the more substantial plates on Picard's menu. \n\n\"The Monte Cristo:\" One of the daily specials I somehow talked my mother into ordering this and although she was hesitant it ended up being a hit with everyone at the table.  Limited to only \"about a dozen\" sandwiches that evening and featuring thick maple-custard dredged brioche French toast topped with imported jambon, local turkey, and a blend of Gruyere and Comte plus spreads of guinea hen liver mousse, maple butter, apple jelly, and caramelized onions there was really no part of the palate that this enormous \"appetizer\" did not touch on and with a drizzle of maple syrup to finish the plate the biggest shock was that every flavor came through with aplomb.  Certainly gluttonous but entirely delicious this and what followed certainly displayed Picard's propensity for 'shock n' awe' cuisine but honestly, it works.\n\n...to be continued.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KKucN3P6aH84MCfPr56a8g"}

Personally not a fan of mustard, particularly the pungent Dijon utilized here, what ended up happening was aunt enjoying the salad along with her soup while I de-Dijoned the crispy trotter and enjoyed it with a few leafs of green.\n \nPlogue \u00e0 Champlain:  Admittedly possessing a substantial sweet tooth and a fondness for every ingredient present on the plate this composition of a buckwheat pancake topped with bacon, mashed potatoes, foie gras, Ile-aux-Grues cheddar, eggs, and thick maple syrup infused pork stock was #1 on my list of things to try order at APdC and without exaggeration I'll simply say it is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  A bit breakfast, a bit dessert, and entirely over-the-top savory this is probably the truest representation of what one should expect at Au Pied de Cochon and while I can't say there is anything subtle about this plate it was much like the Monte Cristo in that everything present was noteworthy; an accomplishment that I personally consider validation of Picard's skill of balance in the face of something that could seem sloppy and contrived under other circumstances.\n\nFried Chicken:  Already realizing we had ordered too much even before our main courses arrived the fact was confirmed when two 18\" platters arrived, the first my mother's daily special of 'whole' fried chicken...and when the team at Au Pied de Cochon says whole they aren't fooling around.  Juicy and plump - apparently brined in a combination of buttermilk, maple syrup, and spices for the better part of the day - what was presented on this plate was a chicken coated head-to-toe  and fried crisp alongside house peppered pickles, maple slaw, and onion rings.  Again favoring gluttony (both in presentation and in flavor) over any semblance of restraint yet keeping an eye on balance what I particularly enjoyed about this dish was surprisingly the sweet versus savory interplay of the slaw and the pickles, both serving to as ample foil to the fried food, refreshing the palate and keeping things interesting with each bite.\n\nPied de Cochon:  ...and then there was this, APdC's signature dish featuring a whole pig's leg that was partially deboned and filled with foie gras imbued stuffing prior to being breaded and fried.  Individually tagged and plated atop creamy mashed potatoes with a gravy of foie, lard, butter, onions, broccolini, and mushrooms plus a thick slice of seared duck liver on top this was pure debauchery and although it was slow going each bite brought me back for more, a journey that ended when only approximately 25% of the potatoes, a few bones, and a bit of broccolini remained - a feat that led our waitress to fetch Chef Picard who'd apparently suggested there was \"no way were going to eat all that\" when he saw our order and earned me a smiling nod of approval.\n\nThe Winter Sundae:  With nearly 200 minutes of digestion while watching the Canadians and Lightning play an entertaining (if not meaningful) game we returned to the same table and the same server for a second round and after joking that I was going to order a second plogue as dessert I instead went with the old adage that there is always room for (maple) ice cream - plus maple cotton candy, maple toffee, house made salty caramel, a brownie, cranberry preserves, maple nougat crumble, and whipped cream.  Creamy and crunchy, sweet and salty, chocolate, maple, and without a doubt \"winter\" - delicious.\n\nPecan Pie for two and Sugar Pie for two:  At this point hardly paying attention to menu descriptions it didn't seem illogical to order items made \"for two\" and unable to decide between the pecan pie or the sugar pie we opted for both...not realizing that they would arrive with a goblet of ice cream...each.  House made like everything else at APdC and each warm, decadent, and irresistible I could see both the ladies eyes glazing over into food coma status with each progressive bite and despite the late hour an Americano became requisite - free refills on the house as we sat and chatted with the wait staff and a neighboring table while enjoying the flaky pastry and creamy brown sugar custards with the occasional bite of thick vanilla bean ice cream for good measure.\n\nThe Verdict:  While I can certainly understand some of the criticisms of both the restaurant and Picard's personal style I could not have been happier with my visit to Au Pied de Cochon - it is comfort food taken to an entirely different level and it was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be - it was good enough that I went twice in the same night and good enough that my next trip to Quebec will be predicated by a visit to Picard's Cabane au Sucre followed shortly thereafter by another visit to APdC.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KKucN3P6aH84MCfPr56a8g"}

Owned by Eliot Wexler and considered by many locals 'in-the-know' to be amongst the best restaurants in the city I knew I would eventually make my visit, but it was not until the high praise of new chef Claudio Urciuoli's cuisine and a ringing endorsement from Steve Plotnicki via facebook came across that I moved noca to #1 on my list.  With a concept that seems rather straight forward - high end ingredients prepared with an Italian twist in a casual environment - I generally assumed that noca was going to impress, and at a price point that seemed bargain basement compared to similar establishments in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere.\n\nThe Reservation:  For the sake of full disclosure I have to note here that I was known walking in the door.  Between Steve's endorsements that I must meet his friend Eliot and another local diner who'd apparently told Mr. Wexler about me months before I figured it was only proper to introduce myself to the restaurant's owner prior to making a reservation - an introduction that led to a string of e-mails covering everything from sourcing to local general contractors, and finally a reservation at 8:30pm on Saturday night (actually secured ~18 hours before the meal via Opentable.)  What I hadn't planned on, however, was a stop earlier in the day to check out the afternoon 'nocawich' menu...but hey, why not?\n\nThe Space:  Located, like many Phoenix restaurants, in a simple strip mall the exterior of noca is nothing to get excited about - it could be any random sports bar or billiards hall, but what lies inside is actually quite sleek; a sort of urban industrial feel but still sort of homey and laid back.  By day more casual and by night more trendy the use of industrial light bulbs plus spotlights and mirrors allows the room to be as intimate or as bright as necessary and with an open kitchen during both lunch and dinner service there is plenty to watch.  With a lively bar, close set tables lacquered in black, and brick walls plus a lively soundtrack I will say the space gets loud, but certainly not overly so, and for those who enjoy watching a kitchen at work the marble chef's counter is a great place to eat. \n\nThe Service:  Considering how busy noca was (not an empty seat in the house save for the one to my left) I was stunned at the fluidity and efficiency of service.  Dishes were presented with ample descriptions, questions of ingredients and preparations were answered thoroughly and knowledgably, and aside from a few small quirks (that the average diner would have never paid a second thought to) my primary server named Jenny could not have been more pleasant, professional, or helpful with her suggestions.  A lively spot where many patrons probably don't really pay attention to the quality of the service I'll simply say I've been to a number of Michelin starred spots with a far less impressive front of house.\n\nThe Food:  A sandwich and dessert at Nocawich at lunch/two drinks, eight courses, bread, amuses, mignardises at dinner.\n\nCroque Madame with Pork Belly, Brioche, Fried Egg, Gruyere Foam:  This $10 sandwich from the Saturday Noca(wich) menu would feature a slightly modernist update on the French classic and as much as I love the combination of ham, egg, and cheese in all forms this one raised the bar a bit by utilizing tender belly bacon from Mr. Wexler's supplier out of Iowa paired with crisp brioche, a perfect sunny side egg, a thin slice of aged gruyere, and finally an aromatic foam from an ISI Whip that made cheese whiz seem tame in comparison.  As good as the lobtah roll sounded, I find it hard to believe it would have trumped the croque - but I'm certainly going back with my BOGO from dinner to find out.\n\nRed Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting:  Simple, dense, moist, and featuring an ample amount of tangy cream cheese icing there really isn't much else to say about this cake.  Not overly sweet like so many 'designer' cupcakes the $3.50 rustic wedge was a welcome change from the norm - the cocoa allowed to shine rather than taking a back seat to the sugar.\n\nDinner service will be an addendum...", "type": "review", "business_id": "DcrM4hwDcU2G6vuh2cnaYQ"}

Generally not one to fancy the oakiness of bourbon I have to say the original suggestion gave me pause, but I figured at $10 I could afford to take a chance and as my reward I surprisingly excellent drink with the aromatics of the peanuts pairing with the smokiness of the charred oak barrels to help balance the bitterness of the alcohol while the sweetness of the raspberries came through as a jammy sort of flavor that dissipated soon after it hit the tongue.\n\nHouse Focaccia:  Somewhat less oily than the average focaccia and served without butter or oil the bread service at noca is serviceable but nothing to write home about; the sort of bread you'd use to mop up sauces but certainly not overindulge on - perhaps a good thing considering the portion sizes (as I'd soon find out.)\n\nPanzanella Salad, House Bread, Cherry tomatoes:  The night's amuse this straightforward take on a traditional Italian Summer Salad was one bite off a spoon; bold, balanced, toothsome, and nicely tinged with olive oil and vinegar - a nice way to open the palate to the flavors to come.\n\nFluke Crudo - Sea Beans, Watermelon Radish, Finger Lime:  A gift from the kitchen, I'll start out by saying that in general I don't fancy Fluke - the slight fishiness and snappy texture not really what I prefer in a raw prep - but showing a skilled hand with using sweets and bitters to balance the fish this was about as good as fluke gets.  Doused in oil and lightly touched with esplette the dish had just a bit of kick and a whole lot of flavor; if you like flounder or crudo in general it is definitely worth checking out as the quality of the fish was excellent.\n\nKing Salmon Arancine with Herb Aioli:  At $7 I decided to take a chance on this one despite my general blas\u00e9 for salmon largely because I'd heard Eliot and Chef Claudio discussing the quality of the salmon and because I love arancini - and as it turns out, it was an excellent choice.  Crisp on the exterior with flawlessly prepared Carnaroli rice wrapped around rich salmon each of these three balls was just slightly larger than a golfball and paired nicely with herbal aioli not dissimilar from ranch dressing as well as a paste of what I believe was pimento pepper the flavor was anything but boring salmon, but rather like a southern style salmon croquette with far more nuance thanks to the quality of the rice.\n\nYellow Watermelon Soup:  A palate cleanser before the pastas this small coup of soup was a sort of gazpacho teaming with herbal notes and a slight melon undertone that was both familiar yet unique.  Probably not the sort of thing I'd order a big bowl of, but definitely a refresher between the two seafood openers and the two that would follow.\n\nSpaghettini dei Martelli with Ft. Bragg Uni, Dungeness Crab, Breadcrumbs:  Seemingly more and more common on menus these days I was happy to learn that noca offers half portions of all their pastas so that I could try this out without filling up too much stomach space (as you'll see, this actually WAS an issue for once) and for $9 this was still one heft serving of pasta with the thin noodles amply imbued with briny urchin butter, sweet shredded crab, and a spoon full of breadcrumbs for texture.  Half the price and just as much flavor as similar presentations elsewhere the only critique I could possibly muster for this dish was that the uni was perhaps a little too thin, losing texture but retaining flavor and thus allowing the high quality crab to steal the spotlight.\n\nCarnaroli Risotto with Blue Prawns, Leeks, Aji Panca:  Having already noted the quality of the risotto - the handiwork of a young sous-chef standing in front of me all night - this $10 half-portion of creamy rice unfortunately arrived on the heels of the Spaghettini thus forcing me to make a decision as to which would have to suffer a bit of cooling, but after one bite I knew it was the spaghettini sitting out this dance.  Toothsome yet fluffy, spicy but not 'hot,' and a perfect melding of the aromatic leeks and snappy sweet prawns this was probably the most rave-worthy dish of the evening.  A dish often presented but rarely perfected I've been told that risotto is \"always\" on the menu at noca and if that is the case and it is always this good then I'd suggest there is \"always\" a reason to visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DcrM4hwDcU2G6vuh2cnaYQ"}

Knowing that I'd ordered a bird for my main course I first thought that this was a mistake, but in reality the only mistake was Eliot sending it with instructions that I should just 'have a taste.'  Wanting to show of the quality of his sourcing, what I received here was a 12oz chop of Iowa raised hog and with the pork itself tended and easily cut with a butter knife Chef Urciuoli opted to gild the proverbial lily by punching a hole in the chop, infusing it with rich Manchego cheese and fennel, then wrapping it in smoky speck before cooking it to a juicy medium well.  Enormous in size and savory as hell, the plate was finished with roasted peaches, spicy peach sauce, balsamic, and a bit of beet puree plus shredded cabbage...quite the intermezzo if I do say so myself.\n\nBubba's Half Chicken alla Diavola - Prosciutto Wrapped, Cacio di Roma Filled, Swiss Chard, Peperonata:  Following the theme of stuffed, wrapped, roasted, and served in large portion this $23 half-chicken was ordered as my 'main course' and recommended by Eliot by e-mail even before I arrived it would prove to be anything but \"just chicken.\"  Featuring no-less than half the chicken and roasted to a succulent tan what truly made this dish stand out was the deconstructed 'cordon bleu' approach as the creamy ewe's milk cheese lining the interior oozed forth with each bit while the slight gaminess of the prosciutto added brine to the already crisp skin.  Knowing here that peppers atop such a long day of eating would necessitate Tums, Pepcid, or both I sampled lightly of the pepper stew and only wished I'd have been able to enjoy more as the sweet peppers, garlic, and herbs were lovely but at this stage of the game still too much acid and heat even as I picked around the hotter peppers intertwined.\n\nGreen Apple Cotton Candy:  Declining coffee when Jenny made the offer she went to ready the bill - a bit of a misstep as I surely was not going to skip dessert no matter how full I was - but thankfully Eliot caught her in midstride and ordered two desserts for me...plus a big twirl of this cotton candy, the flavor of a green apple Jolly Rancher spun into an puffy cloud.  \n\nWalnut Cake and Compressed Fuji Apple with Dairy Free Vanilla Bean Sorbet and Cider Broth:  Described as a dacquoise by the pastry chef but utilizing almond in place of the traditional almonds or hazelnuts this light meringue was served atop compressed balls of apple and finished tableside with apple cider.  A light dish in texture but full of flavor I particularly enjoyed the clean finish of the sorbet - an intense vanilla that was heavy on the palate but light on the swallow and serving to meld the walnuts and apples nicely.\n\nTriple Chocolate Flan with Maldon Sea Salt and Praline Rice Crisps:  Whatever the walnut cake lacked in heft was more than made up for in this one - a 'flan' in name only from my standpoint, though I'm sure some gelatin was involved, this was a proper budino that I'd have finished no matter how full I was.  Featuring a top later of dark and a second layer of slightly-less-dark chocolate and topped with just enough salt to create contrast I particularly loved the fact that the bulk of the sweetness was derived from only four little pieces of praline plus a caramelized cookie at the side.  Call it a flan, call it a budino, call it pudding, pot du cr\u00e8me, or panna cotta...it is really quite good, and more than enough to share.\n\nChocolate Chip Shortbread:  A parting gift, just in case you haven't had enough - it was buttery, it was crisp, and at this point I couldn't help but think \"it's only wafer thin\" as I ate it on the car ride home.\n\nThe Verdict:  To say my experience at noca was the same experience every diner has had/will have there would be a bit na\u00efve - I know for a fact there were special circumstances tilting the tables in my favor, but with that said it isn't like I was receiving \"off item\" specials or anything the rest of the room couldn't order and in that case I'll simply say that anyone can and should go to noca with the expectation that whatever they order will be made from the finest ingredients and prepared with an adept hand by a skilled chef.  Having had a number of good-to-great meals in Phoenix both during my recruitment and since settling here noca is the first place I've been where I truly feel like I could become a 'regular,' thanks in part to the quality of the food, the ever changing menu, the comparatively low prices, and finally to Mr. Wexler and his team.\n\nJust go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DcrM4hwDcU2G6vuh2cnaYQ"}

Bathed in light from the outside at first and then dissipating to a romantic glow as the sun set both the lounge and the dining room at Christopher's have a modern but refined feel with white tablecloths, fine service ware, and comfortable seating abound while the walls are minimally adorned with single flowers, wooden art, and mirrors.\n\nThe Service:  Pleasant, descriptive, whimsical, and efficient James did a great job of working with my friend's allergies while additionally being sure water was always filled and bread was replenished as necessary - an admirable feat as he was probably the only captain on our half of the dining room thus quarterbacking at least four back servers working perhaps twenty tables without ever missing a beat.\n\nThe Food: Wood Oven Pizza with Foie Gras, Andouillette, Boudin Noir & Goat Cheese:  An 8-slice oblong pie clearly focused on decadence I must say that I was hesitant to order pizza in a French restaurant but this $26 dish worked astonishingly well.  Beginning first with the lightly charred crust - sturdy and smoky with a great chew - and moving next to rich and lightly brined chevre I was immediately impressed by the quality of the base and moving on to the trio of offal things only got better as the creamy melting liver, briny blood sausage, and onion-laced crumbly pork all melded into a complex flavor that was at once mineral and pungent but also slightly sweet thus preventing it from being overly rich.\n\nTerrine of Mousse of Foie Gras served w/ Brioche:  My first course of the prix fixe was a nearly 2 ounce slice of creamy foie gras topped with Hawaiian black sat served with golden brioche, greens lightly dressed in vinaigrette, and three dots of reduced Balsamic.  A very traditional preparation, particularly next to the pizza, this was my third foie gras course of the day and although the least 'unique,' a very smooth and well sourced product served in surprising portion for a $40 prix-fixe.\n\nPied du Cochon with Brussels Sprouts, Mustard Seed, and Smoked Bacon:  For our main courses Aileen opted for the Steak Frites while her sister chose the Dover Sole Meuniere and while I didn't taste the former but quite liked the simplicity of the later I was more than happy with my choice of two flaky pastry shells stuffed full of crispy trotters alongside caramelized sprouts and a sauce of smoked bacon and fresh mustard seeds.  Intense and savory, well balanced with the pungency of the sprouts, and just a touch of earthy heat from the mustard this was another bistro style dish slightly reimagined that impressed even despite my overall distaste for mustard, an ingredient that here acted to enhance the salty pork rather than mute it as is sometimes the case.\n\nDaily Gnocchi with Onions, Belly Bacon, Taleggio, and Cream:  For $8 this was an absolute steal of a side dish as there were no less than fifteen tender dumplings swimming in a pool of bubbling cheese and cream tinged with bacon and onions.  Admittedly getting full at this point in the day, particularly as I'd eaten 3/4 of the pizza myself plus a few slices of bread I made sure I finished each dumpling, particularly those where the cheese had browned to form a bit of crunch, but I still regret sending a good portion of the creamy cheese mixture back to the kitchen rather than applying it to another slice of baguette.\n\nTarte Tatin with Vanilla Bean Gelato:  My prix fixe dessert, and another enormous portion, was this rustic apple tarte tatin with buttery caramelized apples juxtaposed against a crisp pastry shell alongside drizzles of cr\u00e8me anglaise, salty caramel, and a tuille cup filled with rich vanilla bean gelato.  Now three for three in the frozen confection department this was a lovely representation of \"French Apple Pie\" and while I still prefer America's take on the dish this was certainly a memorable dessert teaming with butter and not overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nChocolate Mousse Tower with Berries, Espresso Cr\u00e8me:  Having joked with James that it seemed odd not to serve the dish that Chef Gross prepared with Julia Child as part of her tribute menu he had to agree but for $10 extra it would have been foolish to pass on this lovely cylinder of white and dark chocolate stuffed with light chocolate mousse and berries as a supplemental dish.  Topped tableside with a light espresso cream and nicely balanced with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries against the lightest chocolate tones of the evening I can certainly say this dish is worth the praise it receives and a great deal of impact on the palate for something so light,", "type": "review", "business_id": "1M4oczf2lmkdgbrJ3J7OqA"}

Electing to sample two sweets and two savories it was with a trio of selections and the smooth, dense, and semi-molten-centered bread pudding to follow that our meal progressed and attempting to abstain from exaggeration I will simply say that if I returned I'd be hard pressed not to order the exact same thing, the French Toast harkening a fruit infused Bostock and the pasta a peerless example of knowing how to use truffle oil with restraint, the end result a dish warranting an extra slice of focaccia to sop up every drop of the eggy aromatic cheese.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5GKbGn9-fAgQ0njSh3OJ8A"}

Located across the hall from the aforementioned gallery, in a flag and tile clad space featuring outdoor dining offered for those lustful for fresh air, it was just minutes after the restaurant's 6:00am opening that I entered a small queue and with a plethora of pastries gleaming behind glass a substantial order soon took shape.  Obviously far less famous than celebrity-backed bakeries touting the names of Keller, Payard, Buddy, and Jean-Philippe but no less innovative in its offerings my experience at Palio began with a duo of croissants and although the explosively flaky almond rendition instantly set a new standard for The Strip it was the overstuffed Dulce de Leche version that soon stole the show - each delicate bite through arches of crisp lamination yielding a burst of creamy caramel that my early arrival found still-warm.  Quickly devouring both croissants before scaling back to a \"some for now/some for later\" approach to the rest it was in the doughnut and cinnamon roll that I next partook and although both were nicely made, the former sporting a pleasant looseness to the crumb beneath light notes of citrus, neither were 'must orders' compared to what followed - a toasty gold pocket chock-a-block full of hazelnut spread that I'd strongly advise sitting down to enjoy as a grab-and-go approach is almost assured to end in a trip to the laundry for shirt, pants, or both.  At this point turning to more portable items as I slowly wandered the tourist-free serenity of Sin City's early morning hours it was next in a bearclaw that I indulged and although nicely textured I personally found the results far too sweet, the lacquer of glaze entirely overwhelming  sparse nut filling and thus leaving me to instead focus on a duo of cookies, the Chocolate Chip a textbook rendition with crisp edges surrounding a soft center but the Oatmeal Raisin far better with buttery notes playing off cinnamon and softly set oats as a mountain of golden raisins added just enough sweetness to taste equally breakfast and dessert.\n\nUndoubtedly underrated due to the lack of celebrity signage and a location slightly off the beaten path, suffice it to say that Palio Caf\u00e9 is executing on just as high a level as Bouchon, Payard, and even Bellagio's own Jean Philippe.  While some may say that prices are high, at $4.25 the croissants are no more expensive than the inferior versions at other on-strip vendors while other options actually represent a bargain compared to its peers, both here in Las Vegas and across the nation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nLNA7OOkBKMLjn_WMHi_Zg"}

At this point sated but certainly not stuffed it was with great spectacle that our final savory course arrived and featuring two platters each of Eggplant Parmigiano,  Housemade sausage and meatballs smothered in marinara, and a bounty of fresh squid/shrimp/sea snails/mussels smothered in creamy white sauce plus a bowl of supple braised tripe the table was literally covered as eyes stared wide - leftovers a guarantee, though all ate heartily with favorites varying from person to person and the tripe a personal favorite, especially atop slices of warm bread from the refreshed basket.  Taking to heart the gluttonous portions provided thus far dessert was ever so slightly scaled back as hot, spongy Zeppole dowsed in powdered sugar and filled-to-order cannoli both shined brightly while Rainbow cake, Butter, and Almond cookies were spot-on authentic  - a characteristic shared by a hot sfogadella that I requested as I paid the bill, ostensibly for 'later' had it not been so perfect...the creamy citrus filling beneath shattering layers not even making it to the car, no matter how full I was.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XZWry6opFKs-BIwfpa_RWg"}

Setting prejudices aside and deciding to let the food do the talking I was pleasantly surprised.  Full review with pictures is in my blog, highlight dishes are below:\n\nWith the kitchen moving surprisingly quickly despite (or perhaps because of) the late hour it would be perhaps fifteen minutes before our first course of the evening would arrive and although something I'd not have traditionally ordered the Almejas Al Vapor would prove to be well worth its \"best in the valley\" designation.  Described as Peruvian in origin and served in a large low-bowl along with dense \"pan de yucca\" bread with a good sponge for dipping this complex amalgam of spicy aji Amarillo chile powder, tender clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, roast corn, basil, garlic, and turmeric was everything its ingredients suggested and then some - hot and spicy, smoky and garlicky, sweet but saline, and all the while complex without being overwhelming.  While I personally could have stood for just a bit less salt and a touch more sweet to temper the spice this was a small quibble balanced nicely by the sweet rolls.\n\nFor the second of this round of appetizers my favorite plate of the meal would be presented as \"Duck Carnitas Empanada,\" an invariably upscale take on the traditional empanada with a golden flaky shell harboring orange glazed duck confit and an admixture of habaneros, mushrooms, cilantro, and queso Oaxaca.  Delectable on its own but certainly open to further adornment the empanada was subsequently topped with a chunk of seared foie gras and finally with a foie fortified queso Oaxaca pan sauce and a drizzle of tamarind oil with the end result sweet, savory, and totally decadent.\n\nLeft with a bit more time to digest and a lot less noise as the restaurant's population had literally dwindled by half a mere forty-five minutes after we were seated the final savory of the evening would arrive just after 11pm and as I was doing the ordering it just so happened to be a second round of my favorite fowl, this time the \"Green Chile Duck Confit.\"  Ample in portion and more so in flavor this pile of two legs and two thighs featured a whole lot of duck for the dollar but unfortunately was just a bit less crispy than one would have hoped - a small quibble as it was not greasy, but not \"textbook\" confit by any means.  Again spicy without being \"hot\" the duck subsequently topped with sultana serrano peanut mole and paired on the plate with savory \"cheesy fried hominy\" that tasted something like a cross between popcorn and corn nuts plus smoked mushrooms to help ground the rest of the flavors.\n\nFor dessert The Mission's Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Scotch, Caramel, Pepitas, Pomeganate, and Chipotle seasonings was quite outstanding.  Beginning first with the pudding, almost a steamed sticky pudding in texture, the flavor of the pumpkin, cinnamon, and clove was present in spades and the scotch tones blended nicely with the sweet caramel giving it all a heavy handed boozy bite.  With a touch of spice from the chipotle cooled by quickly melting dulce de leche ice cream I additionally found a lot of appeal in the pumpkin seeds and pomegranate with their respective salty and sweet crunch adding some texture.\n\nA modest tab, particularly when split, we opted to divide the bill down the middle and with that we made our way to the streets where, as I'd been told, few people were to be found at 11:30pm even on a Saturday.  Saying our goodbyes I made my way to my car satisfied with my meal at the Mission and realizing that perhaps my bias against \"scene restaurants\" was a bit unfounded, much like my preconceptions about \"Southwest cuisine\" - a fitting conclusion to my first trip to Arizona and a bit of reassurance that I could undoubtedly live here.  Sure the city shuts down early but to be completely honest by the time we left The Mission it was already nearly 2 hours after my typical bedtime anyway.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YKOvlBNkF4KpUP9q7x862w"}

Equally impressive, a long list of Mexican-influenced food proved to be high quality and well-priced - the pork mole smoky and aromatic while the duck was gamey and tender with bits of cracklins' tucked in for texture.  Falling on the other end of the spectrum, I'd urge everyone to pass on the dreadful miniature almond croissant, limp and cool to the touch for $2.50, as well as the flavorless and doughy $4 bread pudding and instead order a crepe - or walk down a few feet and sample the flourless chocolate cake for free...or better yet, walk to the back of the market and buy some sweets from Tammie Coe.\n\nHonestly though, if someone can name a place else where one can order a really good duck tamale appetizer, a piping hot Neapolitan Pizza main course, and a pair of fluffy souffl\u00e9s at 9:00am while perusing fresh local produce and artisan goods please let me know.  Add in the fact that amongst the local artisans are Tammie Coe pastries and frequently local wine makers sampling out their wares in the warm Arizona sun and I'd be hard pressed to name a more unique experience in the greater Phoenix area - at least from October until May when all the snowbirds leave and the heat index is over one-hundred degrees by the time the market would normally open.", "type": "review", "business_id": "f9WU18QfVnUSuYbkQx5iIw"}

Certainly not full after two small pastries I agreed and he suggested we meet over at the Wynn - near the poker room.  As previously noted, I'm usually a man with a plan when it comes to eating on vacation so the walk over to the Wynn provided me ample time to think of a good spot - eventually deciding to get out of the Wynn, check out Encore, and grab breakfast at  Caf\u00e9 Society Encore.\n\nArriving just after 9:00am I was surprised to find the large restaurant packed and my friend and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table.  Seated promptly and provided with menus our drink orders were taken - a coffee for myself and a $9 (ouch) vanilla protein shake for my friend.  While he noted the shake was tasty my friend was admittedly shocked when the bill arrived - even using the best whey on the market there is no way this shake was more than $1 worth of ingredients.  My coffee, also expensive at $4 for a relatively average brew, was refilled slowly at best - and only when I asked.  All this despite there being two bartenders and only one other person at the 10-seat bar.\n\nPlacing our orders next my buddy opted for the waffle with blueberries, a side of egg whites, and an English muffin - all of which he stated were good but \"overpriced\" while I myself chose the Frosted Flake French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Chocolate Cream.  Arriving after a relatively short wait the dish contained two pieces of brioche dipped in frosted flakes and topped with perhaps one half of a caramelized banana plus a small dollop of creamy but decidedly unchocolately chocolate cream.  Taking an initial bite I have to admit the quality of the bread itself was marvelous and the bananas were wonderful while the chocolate lacked.  Adding a few tablespoons of pure Vermont maple syrup definitely helped the dish - mostly by adding a bit of sweetness but also by bringing forth some of the more subtle vanilla and cinnamon tones of the bread.  A good dish, but at $15 nearly twice the price of the vastly superior and larger French toast at m.henry in Chicago and more expensive than either Keller's or The Country Club's wonderful bread-pudding-style French Toasts in Vegas. \n\nSitting for a while and chatting with my friend - later making plans for another brunch a couple days later I was glad that we were not rushed out but a little disappointed that I had to ask more than once for a coffee refill and that my water glass was taken away after a single glass and never returned.  In the end the total cost for the meal was nearly $50 for food that was good but not great and service that was present at best.  Paying our bill we walked away largely unimpressed - having had breakfasts at multiple places in Vegas now I'd steer clear and make my way to Bouchon, Mon Ami Gabi, The Country Club, or Tableau first - for the price you could even cab it to Hash-House-A-Go-Go and eat cheaper (and perhaps better) - but then if you did that you probably wouldn't have room for lunch and dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fwcoLKfZYMH6nZbAaeD6sw"}

Perhaps not as famous as St. Viateur or Schwartz's, fans and the local media still place the small diner on the same \"Best of\" and \"Iconic\" lists and unlike the former, original owner Hymie Sckolnick is still involved as he approaches his tenth decade of life.\n\nWith an opening hour of 7am, and after a near-ticket with a local police officer targeting people for taking left-turns on a nearby street we arrived at Beauty's perhaps fifteen minutes after opening and after looking at the myriad articles posted in the small entry way entered to find only a few locals sitting at the bar.  Greeted promptly by one of three servers we were led to a booth where menus were provided, coffee was ordered, and we were left to make our choices from a number of deli classics and a few Montreal specialties such as the \"Mish-Mash.\"\n\nSitting and browsing the menu as well as the space, Beauty's is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an old-school Jewish diner - kosher meats, a small selection of baked goods, and breakfast staples like pancakes, challah French toast, bagels, cream cheese, and lox in a room full of small booths and a long counter where short-order cooks quickly and quietly put together breakfast plates while chatting with the clientele while friendly waitresses performed their duties expediently.\n\nOrders placed and by now working on my second cup of thin but well flavored 'joe as my aunt sipped on a large glass of fresh squeezed orange juice it would not be long before our first item arrived - a small order of house made \"Pouding Au Riz\" for $4 plus a 40ml serving of pure maple syrup for $2.50.  Realizing, of course, that profit margins at a place like Beauty's are not that high and setting aside my general distaste for paying extra for a condiment I will say that the rice pudding itself was unremarkable in most ways - a bit too thick, a bit too congealed, and not enough of the golden raisins to balance the lack of vanilla or sweetness.  Adding a bit of the syrup helped, but I also had to conserve for my main course.\n\nMoving next to the aforementioned mains, pancakes for my aunt and French Toast for myself - specifically Apple Cinnamon pancakes and Challah French toast and the former once again proving the point that my aunt simply cannot and should not ever order pancakes as each disc was pleasantly golden but far too dense and largely lacking any semblance of apple or cinnamon flavor aside from the few small chunks of apples mixed into the batter.  Not one to fancy syrup but instead opting for powdered sugar or sugar on her cakes I think my aunt had anticipated cooked apples served overtop but instead was left high and (quite literally) dry for $7.50.\n\nFor my part, particularly with the addition of the overpriced syrup (which they did not even provide me in the special \"Beauty's\" glass bottle,) I have to admit that the $7.50 Challah French Toast was the star of the morning with the dense eggy bread nicely saturated with vanilla tinged custard and seared to a golden tan.  Slightly crisp on the exterior and just a bit 'wet' in the middle there was nothing fancy about the toast - just a good rendition of a classic making me wonder if perhaps Beauty's is the sort of place where one should just stick to the script and order eggs and bacon...an answer I'll probably never know as I'd be very hard pressed to return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "knnz8FU27BMU4jcQBFR_6Q"}

Undoubtedly a locals institution in which nearly every other customer was a regular with orders frequently anticipated by staff it was just past 7:15 that I was invited to seat myself and with no less than three servers offering to get me coffee as I perused the menu it became immediately apparent as to why the restaurant was filled to capacity by eight o'clock.  Focused mostly on diner staples with a whiteboard of specials just left of entry while prices trend far lower than almost anywhere else in the 702 my meal began with Mr. Mama's oft-raved $3.50 cinnamon roll and with a soft, yeasty base rife with cinnamon and butter beneath sweet frosting the hype proved justified, a smallish biscuit proving less worthy its $2.75 tab, though still quite good.  Preceding next to plates more hearty it was with a thin slice of French Toast that my meal moved on and opting this time to bring my own maple syrup from home the result was improved, though still nothing to write home about, particularly when compared to fluffy flapjacks studded with dark and white chocolate, a daily special matched with two eggs and at least six cups of coffee for less than $9.\n\nLikely generating its fan base more through low prices and friendly service rather than by location or particularly excellent food I cannot say I'll be rushing back to Mr. Mama's soon, but for locals on a budget or those with little one's looking for a good breakfast at a great price the restaurant definitely fills a niche - the open-kitchen of blazing-fast line cooks and televisions tuned to college football providing a bit of entertainment for those interested in such things, as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RhbOa-Ft3sZB4B_1j5LfyA"}

Large in size primarily due to the presence of the retail store and deli but with ample seating for guests in both the dining room and small lounge I was greeted first by the man who would serve as my waiter and then by a manager who seemed to know every other patron in the restaurant, both inquiring as to whether it was my first visit and offering suggestions regarding the menu - some accepted and some discarded in order to focus on items I knew to suit my fancy, each and every one a lesson in rustic Italian cooking with top quality ingredients, great depth of flavor, and ample portion.  Beginning first with hot garlic bread paired with olive oil and balsamic before progressing to an even more garlicky plate featuring eight tender snails on crusty bread with rich sauce I was shocked when the next two plates proved to be even better, one a 'salad' of crisp spinach topped with tender portabellas baked in parmesan cheese sauce and the other a pile of dainty potato gnocchi resting in smoky pork cream brightened up by fresh double shucked peas.  With each plate undoubtedly heavy yet finely balanced with no ingredient unnecessary or overwhelming the others it was with a touch of sadness that I realized I only had room for one dessert but deferring the tiramisu and strawberry cake for a later date I do not regret my decision to order the baba one bit, two slices of boozy rum cake lightly sweetened with confectioners' sugar and a ripe strawberry the only garnish necessary...plus a cannoli filled a la minute on the house, as though I needed further food or reason to return in the near future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bt9J3GgjArWCTfyoa3naEw"}

Moving on to better things, the pulled pork was actually a highlight; meltingly tender on buttery little rolls and spiced without being spicy.  Equally good, the pretzel was golden, buttery, and plenty to share (without the ridiculous upcharge for cheese like the average pretzel at Brat Haus) while the dessert cookie was exactly what you'd expect - still scalding hot in the skillet and crispy atop with a near-pudding consistency within, the flavors buttery and tinged with cinnamon plus a lot of semi-sweet chocolate chips - a great comfort food classic, though the ice cream was mere carton quality and did the dish no favors.  \n\nBetter than BW3s, for sure, and actually pretty good by sports bar standards I'd consider going back, though I'd love to know when the nebulous breakfast/brunch ends since no one on the phone could tell me (I hear 12:00 from some, 2:00 from others, though we arrived at 11:50) and I'd skip the coffee - and pray for better service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MXOdsPTLQPsQK9hUq01DWg"}

Eventually allowed to order, a pair of two-tops already well into their meals apparently too much for one to handle, it would not be long before my pastry arrived and proving far less impressive than the standard set by 4&20 most of the morning bun was discarded, a similar situation occurring in the strata - a mundane bellybomb of flavorless bread soaked in eggs with only the slightest bit of sweetness to be found.

Yet another of the many spaces that locals and 'food nerds' overlook I'd strongly recommend stopping by the Parlor to anyone craving a good pizza but unwilling to wait for Bianco - I'd also urge them to order dessert from one of the few places in town turning out great sweets without the assistance of Tracy Dempsey.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pwpl-rxwNRQdgqFz_-qMPg"}

A truly beautiful restaurant, tucked away from the Casino in in typical Mina fashion (Michael Mina Bellagio, Stripsteak, Pub 1842, etc,) I was seated in a corner booth and greeted quickly with a glass of champagne and electing for a cocktail to go with dinner my meal began promptly with Chef Mina's classic corn bread in a muffin form and doing my best to temper eating these by the dozen I still managed to order a second basket as I progressed through six savory courses and two rounds of dessert inclusive of amuses and palate cleansers, plus sides paired with my final savory.  Focused squarely on the sea with fish generally out of the waters no more than 24 hours each and every plate that arrived was prepared to a lightly cooked exterior and delicate rare internal temperature, the tender scallop balancing a creamy piece of foie gras and the shrimp and grits particularly impressive while the lion fish was flaky and light, beautifully complimented by the brine of the mussel chowder and smoky pork.  Always happy to overindulge on dessert, even though the hush puppies were like sweet and savory crawdad doughnuts, the team at American Fish continued the trend of very impressive sweets that I've seen from Baltimore to Detroit to Vegas and San Jose with a quartet of options where doughnuts and bread pudding both shined and cheesecake wowed; the lightness of the mascarpone something I generally don't anticipate in the dish but truly impressive in the setting of light vanilla cream and reduced berries.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_5k83wy9_5NpErw7Ecgt3g"}

Highlight courses below.\n\nI must say that the dining room at Sage is amongst the most dramatic in Vegas.  High ceilings, excellent spacing, minimalist art on the walls, plenty of dark tones and piano finish, plus ample lighting at each seat without being too bright between tables - the word \"sexy\" comes to mind immediately.  With ambient forgettable music playing overhead the location and setting does not hide the fact that you are in Vegas, but at the same time you feel miles away from a \"casino restaurant.\"  Not as secluded as Savoy, Robuchon, Twist, or Alex, but a different experience entirely - Sage feels accessible, a place where a drink and appetizers, a course or two a la carte, or a tasting menu are equally valued and nice jeans and a button down shirt look just as appropriate as the Tom Ford suit you could buy next door.\n\nBeginning the menu proper my first course would be perhaps Sage's most famous dish - the Foie Gras Creme Brulee with Blood Orange, Gran Marnier Glaze, Cocoa Nibs, and Salted Brioche.  Cracking the crisp crust and taking a bite the custard was ethereal - light yet harboring the very essence of liver with notes of egg, orange, and cocoa largely detectable on the palate more so than the tongue.  Eating slowly each bite was as good as the last and pairing the custard with the crunchy and buttery brioche was every bit on par with the best torchon I've ever had - at The French Laundry - and if possible Sage's version was even lighter and more flavorful.\n\nAlready abuzz with anticipation of what could follow such an incredible opening act my second course would prove equally competent.  Titled Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi with Smoked Ricotta Cream Sauce, Truffle Puree, and Parsnips the pasta was absolutely flawless - pillows of potato accented air that dissolved on the tongue.  Utilizing crispy parsnips and fresh spinach for textural variation while liberally topping the plate with fresh shaved truffles and a pleasantly subtle cream sauce with hits of parsley and chive the entirety of the amalgam tasted something akin to a baked potato with the aroma of truffles.\n\nAs good as the foie gras and gnocchi were, my favorite savory of the meal would turn out to be the fourth course - Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg, Smoked Potato, Shaved Winter Truffle, Toasted Country Bread.  Always one to favor egg dishes, everything from the presentation to the flavor of this course was immaculate.  Served in a bowl at least 1 foot in diameter with a creamy foam of creme fraiche topped with shaved truffles as the only visual stimulus on arrival, the smell of the dish was that of truffle and smokiness.  Plunging my spoon deep and piercing the creamy egg I mixed slowly while enjoying the aroma before taking a bite - smooth potato gratin, creamy egg, the mild tang of the creme fraiche, and the aroma of truffle rising to the palate.\n\nMy sixth plate would prove to be another stunner - and the best duck I've yet to experience in Las Vegas.  Titled Grimaud Farms Duck, Celery Root Puree, Confit Leg, Heirloom Apples and also featuring crispy Fried Kale and Black Mission Figs the duck itself was meaty without being gamey and fatty without being overly so.  With crispy skin the three one ounce slices of duck were perched atop an unctuous and salty confit of leg while the plate was topped with a reduction of fig and balsamic.  Sitting at the base of the plate, a pave of celery root topped with apples and figs - bitter and sweet, multi-textured, and seamlessly melding with the duck forms above.\n\nWarm Brioche Bread Pudding with Roasted Pecans, Myer's Rum Sauce, and Brown Butter Ice Cream was absolutely the best non-chocolate bread pudding I've ever tasted.  Soaked through yet delicately crisp on the exterior the buttery brioche was spongy without being wet or heavy.  Topped with a thick and boozy sauce and then with a quenelle of rich and buttery ice cream the dish found contrast in temperature while crunchy pecans proved a crunchy foil to the otherwise soft and intensely sweet dish.\n\nThe first dinner in a truly over-the-top week of eating, I still look back fondly on my experience at Sage.  Call it Midwestern sensibility if you like, but there is simply something to be said for the elegant yet accessible nature of what McClain and team are doing at Sage - the space, service, and prices are nothing like the top tier of Vegas dining - but the experience and food every bit as impressive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OiCxoAIoBvEWxf7p1qVVmA"}

Grand in size, with soaring ceilings and dark woods juxtaposing white leather and signature styling, a meal at Hakkasan begins with check-in at an outer atrium and soon to be led between several dividers that serve to break the room into a series of alcoves it was expectedly the wine and cocktail list that arrived first, the upsale on from the start and continuing as the a la carte menu was presented with no mention of Golden Week to be found.  Pleasant and competent in service, despite obviously ignoring the notes in my reservation requesting the special menu and a seat with good light, it was with a single a la carte option that our meal began and with the intricate broth surprisingly vegetal to balance the sweetness of fresh crab I only wish we'd have had more time to enjoy it - the first course of dim sum and duck arriving hot on its heels with no more than two bites enjoyed.  Opting to set aside soup in order to focus on the progression of tastes it was with a sampling of the aforementioned duck that Golden Week began and essentially using the briny eggs to offset the fatty bird's sapor each bite was pure indulgence, the skin so thin it seemed razor cut and the attention to detail soon found to be duplicated in a steamer basket of dumplings from which both the spicy duck and creamy scallop shined.  Moving quickly to round two as I again attempted to enjoy the now-cool soup it was here that a trio of plates was presented and with promises that the 'rest' was soon to come I finally explained that the kitchen needed to slow down, a request thankfully met by allowing us to focus on what was present - the aromatic clay pot and fried rice loaded with tender abalone amongst the very best plates of the meal while the spicy shrimp in an admixture of peppers and nuts was the sort of thing I knew I'd regret later as beads of sweat burst forth from my brow.  At this point only fifty minutes into the meal it was thankfully after a short break that round three arrived and with both dishes using mushrooms as a base to impeccable proteins it was something of a surprise that the tender beef proved to be the best dish of the meal, a melting mouthfeel amidst innumerable spices and light acid that fully engaged the palate without coming off as 'hot' in the least.  Rounding out the evening it was in a bowl of six glutinous rice dumplings that we indulged and with melted dark chocolate bursting forth to mix with cells of finger lime and a broth of light ginger one could not help but swoon, a similar citrus and cocoa experience offered in a duo of golden macarons presented in a take-home box at the meal's end.\n\nDecidedly expensive for a meal that lasted just ninety minutes I remain perplexed to this moment as to why the kitchen felt the need to send plates in clusters at such a rapid rate but with that issue aside I'm happy to say that both ingredients and preparation were exquisite, the opportunity to experience the duck without investing in a whole-prep particularly welcomed considering the sizable scoops of caviar while every other plate was delicious and surprisingly well portioned considering the tasting menu format.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ieuv-XET6SR_qIscZzgD-A"}

Every bit a reminder of a Woolworth's back home in Ohio, with short-order cooks overseeing a menu of classics frequently tinged in whimsy, it was to a service team of one that I was greeted on entry and with a floor polisher whirring in the background as its driver weaved amidst aisles of toiletries, tablets, and even some toys a two-part order was crafted - the total bill less than $14 even after tax and tip for food that was served not only piping hot with a smile, but also surprisingly delicious despite its simplicity.  Admittedly a bit strained in service as my empty beverage languished it was with the $3.95 Elvis Sandwich that my meal began and although buttery Texas Toast surrounding ripe bananas plus ample peanut butter was as tasty as expected the basket of onion rings proved far less foolproof, the flavor of questionably fresh oil rendering the batter entirely off-putting - a $1.50 upcharge eliminated from my bill when I mentioned the issue to its cook.  Moving on to something far more decadent it was after only half of my sandwich had been consumed that the $5.95 stack of pancakes arrived and although impressive on their own with soft notes of buttermilk imbuing each bite it can only be said that the addition of bananas saut\u00e9ed in butter represented a significant upgrade, the drizzle of caramel and mountain of whipped cream atop a generous scoop of ice cream and walnuts pushing the whole thing into dessert territory in the very best of ways.\n\nTouting a menu far more interesting than several other local diners with prices that rival many chains for 'bargain' status Huntridge Pharmacy & Soda Fountain is a truly authentic experience in a city that many bemoan for being entirely too fake, the food far better than you'd expect given both the price and the locale.  Admittedly a bit lackluster in service given the skeleton staff, hand-written bills, and orders that occasionally back up when cooks are asked to prepare kosher options suffice it to say that the Soda Fountain is one of those spots everyone should visit at least once, and one that only stands to gain if and when the Huntridge Theater renovation finally takes place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8lxgsvzSgp3Wqjs9ntaiSA"}

While the Claes Oldenburg piece is certainly interesting and well placed, the directions to the Mandarin front door are not.  A walk, a 2 foot elevator ride (couldn't find the stairs,) more stairs, a doorman, and finally an elevator to the 23rd floor eventually found me standing at the hostess podium where I was greeted pleasantly by a pair of young Asian women - one of whom would end up being my server, Kristy.\n\nOffered a free Newspaper (Times, Journal, or USA Today) I opted for the Times and was led to a comfortable seat near the window.  With soft wood tones and plenty of natural light throughout the room and a mild ambient soundtrack playing overhead I'll note that the restaurant was largely empty with only three other couples dining during my 90 minute breakfast.  With that noted, Kristy was an exemplary server and beverages remained full with her checking in on me frequently, asking about where I was from, and making small talk without being invasive at all.\n\nBrowsing the menu I'll note that the prices at MoZen are not at all cheap - but the quality service, room, sourcing, and preparation are worth the cost.  With orders placed my coffee was filled (Illy) and I browsed the provided selection of Staud's honey and jam while waiting.  To start my meal I was offered an amuse from the kitchen - a yuzu infused grapefruit \"elixir\" that was intensely tart but surprisingly sweet - a great way to awaken the palate, though not particularly a great match for the coffee.\n\nFor my first course (yes, I ordered two breakfasts since I couldn't decide on one) I opted for the Croque Madame featuring  grilled sourdough, Serrano ham, Gruy\u00e8re cheese, sunny-side up eggs and gratin of Mornay.  Served with grilled vegetables and a side of apple wood smoked Kurobuta pork bacon, the Croque was excellent, albeit somewhat small and underfilled compared to that at Comme Ca, Bouchon, Morels, or Fleur.  Flawless eggs topping smooth and delicate ham, the sourdough itself was nicely toasted and the cheese/Mornay combination proved a mellow foil to the salty ham - all told a solid Croque, but probably not justifying the $19 price tag.\n\nWith at least my third refill of coffee (I lost track, but at $7 I figured I'd drink to my heart's content) poured it was only a matter or 15 minutes reading about the Islander's woeful season before my second dish would arrive - this time Walnut-Banana Bread French Toast.  Featuring \"thickly sliced warm banana and walnut bread, lightly battered and pan-fried with whipped cream and Vermont maple syrup\" this was one of those dishes that tasted every bit as good as it sounded.  While I generally prefer my French Toast in the custard style, using a hearty bread like Banana Walnut in this case allowed a crispy caramelized exterior while the bread itself maintained its characteristic pastry-like consistency.  Topped with warm and bubbly fresh syrup and creamy whipped butter (no whipped cream as noted on the menu) the taste and texture of dish was closer to dessert than breakfast and the flavors went very nicely with the coffee.  A hearty portion at $18 the price was still high, but I'd definitely order this one again on a return visit.\n\nFinishing the French Toast Kristy asked if the chef could send out one last taste and I agreed without question.  While I cannot recall the official name, the item I received was delivered by the chef himself and described as a warm \"donut.\"  Essentially a pate a choux similar to a large gougere but stuffed with warm vanilla custard the pastry itself literally melted in the mouth leaving behind a warm splash of creamy vanilla - while not exactly a donut, if it were a donut it'd be the best I've ever had.\n\nSettling the hefty bill (about the same price as their Sunday brunch after tax and tip) I will note that Mozen was the most expensive solo breakfast I've ever attended, but at the same time it really is not out of line with what one would pay at Bouchon or Tableau and the food was just as good while the service was actually superior...and all three are equally tricky to locate.  Packing me up a cup of coffee and two extra \"donuts\" (no charge) to go I thanked Kristy and the woman at the reservations desk for a lovely meal and got lost, again, en route to the lobby.  Next time I'm in Vegas I'm heading back to MoZen for the brunch - assuming I can find it.  For now I'll just call it a hidden gem and hope that others discover it for themselves.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0jq5ZFLRqAAujEuymdPu4g"}

Noting here that this single cup was more expensive than both my beverage at Toi Moi et Caf\u00e9 and Brulerie St. Denis while, to my mouth not as good as the former and only slightly improved to the later I certainly understand the appeal of Myriade to locals as it represents some exotic choices, but as a visitor I'd rather experience beans roasted locally than a selection culled from other cities at a higher price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "60vZ8jCQ5yjNpDJBUeRIIg"}

Shying away from items like shrimp and grits previously experienced at other Emeril locales round two of the meal continued the bar-food trend and while the liver on the burger was overcooked and meager the patty, fries, and aioli all shined - a compliment even more befitting the juicy fried chicken whose crunchy batter and hefty spice profile rival the best in the Valley.  Ever happy to indulge in dessert, even after the sinful frosting-paired sweet potato fries, it was midway into the third period that I finally placed an order and arriving just as the horn sounded the meal ended just as it did over ten years prior - an ethereal bread pudding rife with vanilla and booze alongside a slice of the Banana Cream Pie equally responsible for building an empire as the word Bam!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BAFb16CUpRBKjG0a9189GQ"}

Not particularly a fan of Fieri but having found some of his recommendations to at least be interesting (and in the case of Rino's Place occasionally outstanding) the restaurant fit my time frame as well as location and as such I decided to give it a go.\n\nArriving shortly after the doors opened at 6:30 Over Easy Caf\u00e9 was easily located via GPS and attached to the Phoenix Coyotes Ice Den practice facility I allocated parking quickly and after a quick browse of the rink I made my way into the caf\u00e9 - a starkly decorated seemingly converted office space with a breakfast bar and Formica all around and with a few tables of patrons already seated I was greeted at the door with the suggestion to sit anywhere I like.  In this case electing for a two-top near the doors I took my seat where silverware wrapped in napkins along with the menu were already in place and grabbing a copy of the local paper I started to peruse the menu moments before service would arrive, a pleasant young lady named Samantha who appeared to be the only server working the room.\n\nClearly a place for regulars as nearly ever patron to enter after me was greeted by name Samantha welcomed me and filling my water asked if I'd like coffee while I perused the menu; an offer I gladly agreed to when I noted that they were serving the same locally roasted Caf\u00e9 Cortez as the day prior at Morning Glory.  \n\nWith my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 7:00 I opted for two dishes, both garnering a \"good choice,\" and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive.\n\nWith service efficient and friendly throughout my stay and coffee maintained near full along with my water my two plates would arrive simultaneously and having heard some (Food Network) call Over Easy the best breakfast in the state while the posters on the walls hailed Fieri's commentary I started first with their signature item of Waffle Dogs, three chorizo spiced pork breakfast sausages on sticks dipped in the house waffle batter and fried to a golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar.  Warned that these were hot in temperature but mild in flavor Samantha suggested a combination of maple syrup (not authentic maple, mind you) and hot sauce as a condiment for this and first tasting the Dogs themselves and then with syrup and sauce I had to admit they were better dressed but not terribly impressive either way.  A bit spicy and a nice blend of sweet and savory the overall impression was that yes, this was kind of like a corndog, but without the cornbread and thus inferior.  Light and without oiliness the crispness was appreciated, but overall rather lacking for a \"signature\" dish.\n\nMoving next to my second selection, the better of the two by some degree, a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients, but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas, crunchy pecans, and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee.  Certainly not a breakfast for those lacking a sweet tooth one slice was definitely enough, especially after the waffle dogs.\n\nWith a coffee offered for the road and the clock just shy of 7:45 I accepted the to-go cup and after paying the admittedly modest tab plus tip made my way from the restaurant en route to clinic along with the newspaper housing and sports sections that I was encouraged to take along with me.   Overall a nice place with good service I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Over Easy, but considering its location I could certainly see it making a great breakfast spot after a morning skate - goodness knows it would have trumped the Denny's or Bob Evans I frequented after hockey as a lad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cz0McL5lUaihqOIw0_Yo7w"}

Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese \"Whooparons\" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SAU9NDWNuR0Jvgx38T8wsA"}

Rustic as hell, savory but sweet - a good start and a sign of things to come.\n\nArriving quick on the heels of the crostini and garnering the majority of my early attention due to temperature components, Fried Green Tomatoes with Green Goddess and Feta would prove to be the highlight in an evening full of them and without a doubt the best tomato based dish I've had since my first visit to Alinea.  Still a touch sour and retaining all of its snappy texture despite a quick dip in the fryer each medallion of cornmeal crusted tomato was a shock to the palate and well balanced by the tangy cheese with a substantial vegetal component added by sour cream, chervil, lemon, pepper, and what may have been avocado this plate sang a song of late summer with every bite as good as the one prior.\n\nHaving already mentioned FnB's aptitude for pacing but informed by my server that people were finishing up earlier than anticipated and thus they'd not need my seat for LnL I heard the young chef before me inform the rest of the team to start working on my next course as I reached the final bites of the crostini and within fifteen minutes course two arrived as a complete trio with a main and two sides, none with meat and none needing it either; to quote a non-vegetarian friend \"you could make a complete meal out of just the vegetable side dishes and walk out happy.\"\n\nBeginning first with the main course as it was actually the weakest of the evening's savories, the \"Pasta, Lobster Mushrooms, Tarragon, Corn, Peas, Pistachio Crumb\" was not a 'bad' dish by any means, but at $25 the house made rolled noodles, butter, and fresh vegetables it simply did not live up to the price tag.  Obviously not one to quibble prices of quality ingredients I certainly see where Charleen was going with this dish but even at $5-10 less it was just pasta, a bit of olive oil, vegetables, nuts, and fungus - the later two together dominating the flavor and texture profile to the point where the rest was superfluous.\n\nFine with the pasta but wanting to be wowed like I was by the tomatoes I found salvation in both \"sides\" and if I were forced to choose which I liked better I'd likely suggest the \"Spaghetti Squash Almondine\" in one breath and the \"Roasted Carrots, Pine Mushrooms, Garlic Butter\" in another - the former featuring tender strands of the sweet gourd touched with pepper, oil, and a generous helping of toasty sliced almonds and the later carrots in different degrees of preparation paired simply with rich butter, mounds of tender mushrooms, and a healthy compliment of garlic; a perfect bite found in the charred carrot and a particularly hefty 'shroom on a slice of bread dredged in the garlic butter.\n\nEssentially incapable of skipping dessert after such a good (okay, fine, any) meal I was hoping for bread pudding as an alternative to the pudding I knew I would be having a few weeks later at the FnB/noca showdown I was disappointed when the answer was panna cotta and thus went with the Butterscotch Pudding, Fresh Whipped Cream, Nutmeg hoping it would be as good as the rumors - and to that, I guess it depends which rumor you believe because for me it was good, but in the end entirely unmemorable as the use of unflavored whipped cream did a nice job of balancing the sweetness of the pudding but did nothing in terms of texture rending each bite the same as the last in terms of taste and texture.  A spoonful would have been enough.\n\nAdhering rather closely to the previously noted time restrictions and finishing up the last bites of the pudding around 9:05 my server next arrived with the clever Ipad billing system and $90 (after tax&tip) later I was bid farewell by servers and staff before making my way to the streets of Scottsdale where even on a Sunday night well-heeled folks were out drinking, dining, and having a great time - though undoubtedly on less 'wowing' food than much of what I'd just enjoyed, regardless of price.  A meal that certainly fell far short of perfection yet at the same time the sort of place I'd return with minimal hesitation I will admit that I don't think FnB comes close to the designation of \"best restaurant in Arizona,\" but with carrots and tomatoes that had me reminiscing meals at Michelin 3* restaurants there is no doubt that there is something special going on in that small kitchen on Stetson.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IuAPYzf3NSyfyXYgT46YVA"}

Knowing Charleen Badman's skills with meats, and more so local produce, I figured that giving the restaurant a second look with family in tow would not only be more fun, but also allow me to sample more of the ever-evolving menu and on both counts I was correct, though unlike my first visit not everything wowed.\n\nPerhaps a fault of the season, or perhaps secondary to the pending move and a jammed-packed house my second trip to FnB (and third meal cooked by Badman, including the Fried Chicken Face-off at noca,) everything at the restaurant just seemed slightly 'off' that night - servers abrupt, pacing off, and the price/quality/quantity ratio all skewed to the left while the sunchoke dish was nearly flavorless and the falafel too dense, served luke-warm, and the majority returned to the kitchen without comment (from our table or the servers.)  Additionally underwhelming considering the $14 price tag was the petite portion of a relatively common cheese - though the accoutrements were all exemplary.\n\nMoving on to what worked - that can be more or less summed up by the rest of the plates; from the creamy hard boiled duck eggs topped with briny olives to the famous leeks and riblets, on to the best Brussels sprouts I've ever encountered and some truly inspired desserts - the persimmon cake particularly with a carrot-cake texture that fused brilliantly with the intense ice cream from Sweet Republic.  More relaxed than my first visit, but at the same time also with less \"wow\" moments I still contest that although there are plenty of things that FnB does very well it is no more than a \"local\" restaurant and a far cry from what many have designated it as \"The Best in Arizona.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "IuAPYzf3NSyfyXYgT46YVA"}

With plate after plate after plate arriving and filling the table I asked Adrian why this was happening and suggested slowing things down to which he responded \"this is a tapas restaurant, sir, it is how things are served.\"  Having already assured himself a lousy tip by this point I explained to him that although I've never been to Spain I have been to a multitude of Andres and Garces spots, plus other \"tapas\" style restaurants and have never seen anything like this.  Without apology I watched him amble off to the kitchen where he actually stopped two servers carrying plates (they would have been numbers 8 and 9 on the table at once) and after this service did improve, mildly.\n\nPlate six was Mediterranean stew in deconstruction | prawns | bronzinni | sofrito, the first of the more \"modern\" tapas.  Familiar with European seabass I think the cut we received was a bit close to the tail and the fish's generally sweet taste was much brinier than expected.  With the prawn slightly overcooked and rubbery the seafood on the plate was fortunately brought up a notch by pur\u00e9ed sweet potato and \"sofrito\" of garlic, olive oil, tomato, and onion.  Taking bites of everything mixed did indeed harken to a seafood stew, but not an exceptional one in any way.\n\nThe final plate in the first (self limited) wave was the best \"modern\" tapas of the meal - tuna-raspberry skewer | ahi tuna | \"molecular\" raspberry | wasabi | sesame seed.  At $14 the portion/price ratio was poor, but the flavors and quality more than made up for it.  With the \"molecular\" aspect a similar texture to a gelee, the sweetness of the raspberry was nicely tempered by the heat of the wasabi while the pan seared tuna coated in sesame seeds lent heft and crunch to the dish.  At the same time visually appealing, texturally intriguing, and tasty this was the sort of dish I had expected when walking into Julian Serrano, though I'd have personally preferred sashimi style from the fish.\n\nThe second dish, Wild mushroom soup | shiitake | crimini | oyster | foie gras cream would prove to be another excellent classic dish spruced up with modern technique.  Similar to my favorite mushroom soup of all time (Canoe's creamless Mushroom soup) but topped off with foam featuring the unctuous sapor of foie gras.  Taken on its own the soup itself was hearty, earthy, and minimally sweet - the cream simply added a whole extra layer of flavor.  This, along with the subsequent dish would prove my favorite of the meal.\n\nOverlooked by myself but ordered by my mother, Creamy risotto | wild mushroom | manchego cheese | natural jus was the steal of the menu at a mere $10.  With a base of flawless rice cooked in mushroom broth the dish found heft in the addition of creamy mushroom broth (quite similar in flavor to that on the salmon) while slices of fibrous mushroom added textural variety.  Topped with a slice of slowly melting year-old manchego that added its characteristic aged salinity the entirety of the dish was flawless - I was especially thankful to receive this in the second wave of dishes as I imagine it would not have been as successful in the cooled state.\n\nWhere the tuna skewers succeeded, Lobster-pineapple skewer | lobster tail | \"molecular\" pineapple | sesame oil failed.  Whether it was the small portions of overcooked lobster or the over sweetened and disconcertingly fibrous pineapple gelee I cannot be certain, but the dish was simply unbalanced and any nuance that may have been intended was lost in the sweetness.  As the final fish dish of the night I'll simply say that aside from the octopus the kitchen at Serrano really needs to pay attention to the textures coming out of the kitchen as nearly every fish was overcooked.\n\nTax and moderate tip included the total cost of the meal turned out to be ~$55/person - not a bad deal considering the fact that we ordered four dishes per person and did not pick based on price.  With that said, when a chef like Serrano attaches his name to something there is an expectation that follows and that expectation was not met.  Overcooked fishes, muddled flavor profiles, and service gaffs (especially the sort where the server tells the diner he/she is wrong) have no place in such restaurants and considering the superstar competition that just arrived in town with two restaurants at The Cosmopolitan these are the sorts of mistakes that could send diners looking for better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqD7X5CHXnJ14YbBBlLx1w"}

Designed in a style somewhere between \"Old time Vegas\" and stripped-down speakeasy with a less-than-ideal location on West Sahara it was with eyes still adjusting from the 6pm sun that I entered the small tavern and greeted at a small podium by the woman later to be my waitress I was quickly led to my choice of tables, a menu soon in hand presenting tough decisions with a resultant four item order divided into two courses accompanied by one of nearly a dozen gin based cocktails I'd have liked to try were my liver's capacity on par with that of my gut.

At this point debating an Aviation versus the Bee's Knees it was a bit to my surprise that my second round arrived immediately on the heels of my first and forgetting the second cocktail as it was likely to arrive far too late to be enjoyed with the food I instead dug straight in, the 12oz bone-in piece of pork seared perfectly and coated with bleu over hand-smashed potatoes amidst a jus of pork and poached figs, the later laying split alongside the protein and still intensely sweet...though certainly not as much so as a bowl of tender tots bathed in a pool of honey beneath snowcaps of toasted marshmallow that ranks amongst the best \"sides\" I've had this year.  At this point sated but happy to go another round it was to an oral explanation of the restaurant's desserts that I was finally treated and although large sharing portions of sugared doughnuts and a skillet cookie were hard to resist it was instead in the day's special that I partook, the piping hot chunk of booze-soaked baguette crowned by a ball of vanilla ice cream proving very 'special' indeed with butter and cinnamon bubbling at its base as if the kitchen had known I was coming and prepared it just for me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LXrq0Fw6MCz70KMA928ldQ"}

Not quite as impressive or diverse as Bonjour Bakery, La Belle Terre, or Thomas Keller's Bouchon but featuring a combination of great pastry and lovely service that sets it apart Baguette Caf\u00e9 is every bit the local gem that many have claimed and although hours and coffee will prevent frequent visits I've no doubt I'll find my way back eventually if not for a full meal at least for thing; an almond financier beyond my superlatives warrants any presumed hassles of location or time, even rush-hour on the 215.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OHsuvX4rmhnPvvRBb-QK7A"}

Tucked away in one of the many nondescript strip-malls along the urban sprawl of West Charleston a visit to Popcorn Girl begins ten-feet from the door with the beckoning smell of butter and on opening the door to cross the threshold the welcome builds in a sea of fresh, smiling faces happy to discuss the store's artisan style and 100+ choices of house-made popcorn, candy, and fudge.  At first a bit overwhelming in variety as bright hues decorate a variety of tins and four different menus it would take mere seconds to identify me as a first timer and handed a menu-map plus an invite to sample \"as much as you like\" I took full advantage - butter popcorn still warm, salted caramel sticky and sweet, and underwhelming vanilla discarded with recommendations to try the 'birthday cake' - a similar base lightly battered and dredged in cake mix.  Served in sizes ranging from $2 to designer party baskets well into the hundreds samples of Butterfinger, green apple, and bananas foster would follow and eventually settling on two mini-bags to compliment my guests' arrival baskets the results were well received; both the marshmallow and graham mixed S'mores and customized Las Vegas mix earning well earned praise for a total tab under $8.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FurH1SdN1OQviPrtMEQBCg"}

Despite my multiple trips to Sin City in the past I'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - Hash House A Go-Go.  Having heard that a third (the other in San Diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the Imperial Palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\n \nWith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a HHAGG shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt Hash House does everything big.  Taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, Noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  Menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  Hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\"  Clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\n \nSitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  With prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when I chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly I'm jaded.  Sitting back and listening to Rock You Like a Hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\n \nArriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  With a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people.  Beginning first with the Blackberry Granola Flapjacks, my sister's choice although I'd lobbied for the Snickers Flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  With ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\n\nPerhaps the most famous Hash House dish would be my order - \"Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\"  Golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  Stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel I have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  While clearly not as subtle and refined as Bouchon's chicken and waffles I actually much preferred this to Roscoe's famous Los Angeles version and the less famous option at DC's Founding Farmers.\n\nOur dessert would be Andy's famous Bread pudding topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  With the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this bread pudding is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  A portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  Buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted Snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  Like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\n\nSettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had P.U.B. leftovers and the Robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to the door accompanied by Eddie Van Halen's Eruption.  Generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food Hash House A Go Go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

Never one to eat processed snack foods this was a rare experience for me with potato chips (or popcorn) and although the others ate more than myself, I loved the way the crisp chips held up to the ample toppings and despite the sheer gluttons of the dish the flavor profile was nicely balanced, albeit quite heavy.\n\n\"Grichebactom.\"  Described as the \"workman's\" grilled cheese I'm not so sure many \"workmen\" find this in their lunchbox, but the combination of grilled sourdough, creamy brie cheese, double smoked bacon, and fresh tomatoes with a side of skinny fries was certainly delicious.  Using the fries largely as a delivery mechanism for Chef English's signature ketchup and BBQ sauce the chunky ketchup was outstanding, loaded with smoke and garlic while the BBQ was a tad sweeter than I'd prefer.  \n\nBLT Sliders with Nueskes bacon, roma tomato, maple aioli, and skinny fries. Served as three buttery rolls loaded with supple bacon, sweet tomatoes, and crisp lettuce the aioli was actually quite mild and more hickory than maple.  Another large portion considering the price and ingredients a whole sandwich ended up packed to go home along with most of the fries.\n\nDuck buns - a rather Asian inspired dish placing confit leg in an aromatic and sweet hoisin sauce on steamed buns, my first bite was good - the confit excellent.  Next adding the cucumber slaw and cool yogurt sauce, this is where the buns truly shined - as good as any steamed bun I've had, whether Dim Sum or David Chang.\n\nLobster Poppie with yorkshire pudding, creamy corn, and brown butter lobster.  Essentially a pot pie with a significant portion of buttery fresh lobster baked atop flaky pastry and dressed In chipotle sauce and house made sweet cream corn the flavors were excellent, though the chipotle was a tad overwhelming in bites where too much had soaked into the pastry.  Listed as a sharable appetizer I'm not sure how well this would divide as it was rather small, but as a main course it would satisfy most.\n\nMona's bread pudding with English toffee sauce, salted caramel ice cream, cap'n crunch.  A large brick of lovely custardized bread with a bruleed top, the bread pudding itself was loaded with cinnamon, sugar, and rum.  Resting in a boozy toffee sauce that tasted largely butterscotch and topped with whipped cream and salty caramel ice cream the dish was finished with a playful handful of children's cereal.  Intensely sweet but subtle in the way all the ingredients contributed to the overall flavor the dish was simple and wonderful\n\n\"Ninja Snacks,\" a plate of eight crispy wontons filled with nutella and banana served with \"ninja sauce\" that tasted quite similar to my English toffee.  Naming issues aside, the wontons themselves were excellent and absolutely stuffed with filling.  Using sliced banana instead of a puree lent texture beyond the crispy wrappers and while the sauce wasn't necessary it certainly didn't hurt.\n\n\"The Elvis,\" a dish described as pound cake, peanut butter, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed bananas, maple bacon and served with a shirley temple.  Delivered as two \"sandwiches\" utilizing pound cake as the bread it really isn't that the dish was poorly designed as it was that the cake was simply too dry.  Tasty otherwise, especially the bacon/maple/banana/peanut butter combination, the Shirley Temple was very sweet and obviously added more for kitsch than flavor.  The chocolate covered peanut was also quite tasty.\n\nChocolate Rendezvous, would essentially represent a chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee topped with peanut butter mousse, topped with marshmallow, and then finished in the oven.  A parfait of sorts with different textures as the spoon proceeded downward the dish was actually too large for something so rich...like the bread pudding and ninja snacks it was a dessert that could have easily been shared, and so it was.\n\nIn a city where the rich and the poor are quite well represented (The amenities, the shopping, the restaurants, and the patrons) it is nice to see there are some places still targeting the \"middle\" and doing a good job with a \"something for everyone\" approach.  Above average food made from above average ingredients in a nice space at below average prices should keep Mr. English's P.U.B in business for quite some time, especially if a whole meal can be had at the price of a pair of socks at the shopping center next door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vSf0pqvaLp5sVSjJPeOqqQ"}

Presentation aside, the cinnamon roll itself was additionally quite excellent; the outside ring suffering from a bit of dryness due to the substantial size but the interior warm, flaky, and easily imbued with a whole stick of butter, a half cup of icing, and multiple tablespoons of cinnamon.  For those wondering, I ate all but the outer ring - and yeah, I could've probably eaten that as well, but the Quails on Main Street looked hungry and I had four more places to eat on the day's agenda.\n\nMoving on to my other options, proving the adage that bigger is not always better the Chambord French Toast would prove to be an excellent dish well worthy of its \"signature\" status with a thick slice of egg bread - think challah without braids or brioche but lighter - split and stuffed with Chambord infused cream cheese and topped with raspberries, Gran Marnier, and light cr\u00e8me Chantilly.  Still a large dish, but far less so than the cinnamon roll the French Toast was a practice in subtleties as each constituent was present, pleasant, and balanced without overwhelming the others...and proving my little sister's theory correct once again, a bit of maple syrup certainly didn't hurt.\n\nFor the last item I'd eat during my stay, a single vanilla bean pancake with apple butter would prove to be sole lowlight of the morning as the cake itself was dense rather than fluffy and largely lacking in vanilla flavor, though the apple butter and seasonal berries were quite nice.\n\nNoting here that I would have been more than contented to leave RnR with a favorable impression at this point, with a $30 certificate to spend and the Buckeyes to watch I stuck around sipping coffee for quite some time while picking at the cinnamon roll and once The Ohio State University had assured a win I picked up two items to go - a chocolate chip muffin and maple bacon scone - both baked in house, served warm, and very nicely done with the scone soft and subtle while the muffin was slightly toothsome and studded with dark chocolate...they went great with a cup of coffee later on at Cartel and solidified RnR as a place I'd definitely return for brunch or perhaps dessert to check out the carrot cake (and maybe a second go at the Cinnamon Roll.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbsFamEj5wDxNAjUKrMcSw"}

Located right in the heart of downtown where the last of the nighttime crowd was returning to their homes/hotels free street parking was an easy score and with myself the only person in the restaurant who'd actually been asleep the night prior it was mere moments before we were seated, coffee poured, and orders taken - a plethora of carbs from which my friends would merely pick at prior to retiring for the night thus leaving me with enviable task of playing cleanup to some truly textbook diner food, decadent desserts, and even a pair of fresh baked goods as I hung around abusing the free Wi-Fi and copious coffee refills until 7:00am.  Without a doubt the sort of place where quality and quantity both matter it really came as no surprise that both the restaurant's French Toast and signature pancakes, even as 'short stacks,' were immense but outstanding - the pancakes particularly light and quite literally 'melt-in-the-mouth,' but perhaps more impressive were the pastries and bread pudding - the donut a lightly raised and amply yeasted version without a bit of grease, the \"bear claw\" reminiscent of the Hungarian Nut Horns at Christmas during my youth but warmer and 10x the size, and the bread pudding a dense, steaming hot wedge covered in caramel and ice cream that rivals the best I've found in Sin City - especially at 5am.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Az85N0Z4OKxOAzGdigi1nA"}

Featuring lightly whipped potatoes at outside edge with a lightly crisp coating each of these delectable bites burst with flavor as the interior housed a dense composition of house made Fior di Latte and Prosciutto Cotto.  Served alongside stewed San Marzano tomatoes and a light salad of grape tomatoes and spinach each bite was fresh and balanced - my only complaint being that there wasn't a half-dozen more.\n\nGnocchi alla sorrentia:  Quite simply, good gnocchi is what every starch should aspire to be in my world and these gnocchi were sublime - each small dumpling so light that it threatened to float off the plate.  A dish so often over/under-done each of these fluffy balls was simply adorned with simple stewed tomatoes, torn basil, creamy Fior di Latte, and a light dusting of Parmigiano Reggiano before a quick trip to the oven produced a lightly caramelized crust.  If you go, this is a must order - and if I go back I'd love to see if they'd be willing to supplement the Bufala in place of the Fior di Latte.\n\nBufala DOP:  Less the gourmand than myself but still knowledgeable of food it was suggested by my dining partner that he was going to order the Regina Margherita but more than happy for my suggestions an upsell to the Bufala DOP took little coaxing and while I cannot vouch to the quality of the Regina I can say without a doubt that the $3 fee was worth every penny as the weekly imported Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP Napoli's tangy funk and ethereal mouthfeel was notable in every bite.  Moving next to the crust (offered cut or un-cut by the kitchen in order to stick with tradition,) slow kneaded and just crisp enough on the edges to keep the rim steady and the center wet I particularly enjoyed the low smoky notes and although a bit more blister would have been ideal the simple garnish of unsweetened San Marzanos, Basil, and a touch of Parmigiano Reggiano was precisely what I'd hoped for walking in the door.\n\nTirolese:  With my colleague ordering the pizza I'd have selected I decided to be a bit more progressive and turned to an equally well constructed pie featuring the same base but subsequently topped with Fior di Latte, Brie, and Speck Alto Adige IGP - a unique imported leg ham first salted and air-dried and then smoked, the flavor harkening notes of sweet, savory, and smoky all at once and perfectly balanced to the acid of the tomatoes by the creamy pairing of cheeses.  Most times a pizza purist when visiting a Neapolitan spot I have to say I may have enjoyed this one even more than the Bufala, though perhaps that simply speaks to the quality of the translucent layer of pork on top.\n\nSemifreddo Alla Mandorle:  No stranger to semifreddo but having never seen it delivered quite like this what arrived to my table was exquisite - a sort of 'ice cream sandwich' but without the ice cream or sandwich.  Featuring a delicate frozen mousse - think whipped cream but frozen - stuffed with chopped figs cooked in honey and rolled in crushed Amaretto Cookie this dessert was the very definition of light and refreshing, a fact furthered by a light drizzle of reduced strawberry and honey plus powdered sugar that made it sweet, but not overly so.\n\nMillefoglie:  Described by some as an Italian Mille Feuille and by others as the hand-held equivalent of a Napoleon this Millefoglie was quite different from the versions I'd experienced in Boston and Philadelphia, but with buttery puff pastry layers juxtaposing layers of pastry cream as well as cream Chantilly plus ample notes of honey and Amarena cherry it would be hard to say this wasn't the best Millefoglie I've ever had.  Far more dense than the semifreddo or a traditional mille-feuille but far less so than most napoleons I'd be hard pressed to describe a dessert I've had that is similar in flavor, though the overall texture was something like croissant meets baklava.\n\nThe Verdict:  While some may contest that VPN certification is meaningless and I would tend to agree, if that is what it takes for 'Pomo to get people past the sub-par exterior and into the restaurant then I am all for it.  While perhaps not the best pizza in the Phoenix metropolitan area due to a little place called Bianco the pies at 'Pomo stand up to the best in all but a handful of cities and when you take into account the strength of the rest of the menu I think it likely ranks amongst the ten best Neapolitan joints I've been lucky enough to visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "x5LrBYPOFlarnDvUTouL7Q"}

Open at 8am and myself the first to arrive just as the doors were unlocked it was to a bright room of psychedelic colors and paraphernalia that I was welcomed by a young woman named Misty and invited to sit anywhere I opted for a two-top with mismatched chairs at the room's center - the open kitchen to my left, a window to my right, Jimi Hendrix IN the table plus a deck of 'Go-Fish' and an enormous menu on it - the latter quickly navigated to the tune of an appetizer and a main plus a side with each scratch-made item prepped to order as I sat listening to The Beatles. Monkeys, and Dylan.  Beginning first with a half-dozen hot donuts dredged in cinnamon sugar for a mere two dollars as I watched the staff of one seat and serve four more tables (whilst also brewing two pots of coffee) it was after perhaps twenty-five minutes that the object prompting my visit arrived and as if to say \"good things come to those who wait\" the golden crisp Monte Cristo was a beauty; light cocoa tones and house-made strawberry preserves taking thinly sliced ham, turkey, and particularly sharp Swiss to a whole new level with each crunchy/creamy bite.  Setting aside a thin and boring biscuit improved somewhat by honey, my request with the sandwich in place of four styles of potatoes, and moving right on to dessert it was admittedly a great showing of restraint that prevented me from ordering the \"PB+B for two\" but with lemon cake and \"awesome\" brownies as the alternatives my choice became simple - the nearly 1/3 pound chocolate-on-chocolate wedge so moist it seemed only semi-solid and so rich that even half the $3 serving would suffice many brownie lovers...so long as the other half is enjoyed with an iced double espresso a few hours later.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jqMWeYMVeqnvHNeMd772Ew"}

Certainly not one to fault a restaurant based on its clientele despite being subjected to a lengthy delay (and a lack of bread pudding which had sold out the night prior) it should be noted that service was mostly spot on with water and coffee refilled repeatedly as we waited and with a gift of plantain chips as an apology for the wait the meal progressed nicely from there, a half-dozen selections both sweet and savory serving notice to Chef Beni Velazquez's unique talents.  With selections ranging from straight forward fried chicken to impressive savory plantain sandwiches and a truly inspired presentation of crabcakes atop fried, smashed plantains topped with a runny quail egg highlighting the savories it would be difficult to decide which item to order if limited to one but moving on to sweets that decision became far less difficult because as good as the crispy donuts with spicy cinnamon chocolate and supple plantain pancakes were neither could hold a candle to the stack of buttery brioche soaked in custard and cooked till crystalized, a light citrus syrup and fresh blueberries gilding the lily and representing one of the best French Toast preparations in a city...and a strong impetus to return sometime for the bread pudding.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LuYZUc1MOG0pA146SCeXgA"}

Large and airy with light spilling into the room to match the bright attitudes of the service team I was seated almost immediately on arriving at a table in back per my request and after perusing the menu decided to do what I often do with a menu so tempting; over order.  Coffee in hand and copious refills to follow my meal started off with a pair of pastries including a tender sticky bun and an unfortunately slightly dry scone that livened up slightly with a touch of butter and jam and moving right along my main plates would arrive shortly thereafter, each proving larger than anticipated.  From the smoky chicken atop a crisp yet pliable waffle and onward to the dense egg-bread topped with fresh berries and bathed in fruit-tinged syrup it would be hard to decide which dish I preferred as both were good but neither were 'best of genre' but unable to resist the signature carrot cake (not gifted to me as many have claimed on their first visit) I must say that this dish truly is special - one of those rare situations where reinterpreting a classic shines a whole new light on the dish and puts something pedestrian on a pedestal, the dense spice cake rife with pineapple and coconut served in three layers separated by light cream and flecked with white chocolate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y6NFyThUU2wtTNa0rX7VrA"}

Opting for specials and staples from diverse regions including Spain, Greece, and nations of the former Soviet Union it was with oddly 'truffled' store-bought potato chips mixed with dry chorizo that our tasting began and rolling next into the duo of oily Chebureki and overcooked dates propped up by an outstanding sherry reduction it was with good fortune that the meal would soon improve, the tender whole squid restuffed with their tentacles and cooked in ink subtly sweet over aromatic rice.  Left precious seconds to digest and discuss a second wave of food soon smothered the table once more and finding far more success than round one both of the breads proved superlative with big flavor and a pleasant degree of grassy funk that I only wish had been present in the tender but flavorless lamb, a 'special' by title only and completely forgotten compared to the bombastic m\u00e9lange of meat, cheese, and vegetal aromatics contained in the clay pot.  At this point sated but happy to finish with something sweet, two-parts each of baklava and biscuit cake rounded out the afternoon with the former benefitted not by lemon nor liberally applied simple syrup while the latter proved exquisite; a delicate balance of crunch and cream with mild sweetness harkening tiramisu but dressed up with honey and nuts that were perhaps stolen from the baklava and used here to better effect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F8ljll9IJhgUmOxUshlqiQ"}

Whimsical and fun but decidedly not an everyday indulgence it's the sort of dish that could assuredly fail under many circumstances and fall under the absurdities or Man vs. Food category, but instead it just works beautifully - a dish that would not be out of place at any number of haute hotdog purveyors in other major cities and more than enough reason to give Short Leash another taste at a later date.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xHI3saK0sAJEHeMK4IGVvg"}

Featuring a farm-fresh menu focused heavily on Wisconsin purveyors with floor-to-(20+foot)-ceiling windows offering wide views of the midday bustle outside it was near the rear of the restaurant that I opted for a shaded seat and with a menu of daily specials alongside several signatures a three-course meal of small plates was created, the service itself perfectly pleasant in offering up apologies for long delays from a kitchen that was dreadfully slow in preparing something as simple as a charcuterie board despite the restaurant being less than 1/3 full.  Certainly not starving after a hearty breakfast it was after nearly thirty-five minutes that my selection of three cheeses and two meats with several house-made accoutrements arrived and with each item tallying $3-to-$3.50 aside from the ultra-aged cheddar I'll simply say the additional $5 surcharge was entirely worthwhile, a sharp bite to the golden wedge better than any I tasted in England and just inching out the pate de Campagne for best thing on the pig-shaped board.  Having mentioned issues with the kitchen I was unfortunately only a quarter into the charcuterie when my three hot plates arrived and setting aside the cold board with a bit of annoyance I found even more frustration with the overcooked pork belly, a limp and flavorless bao doing little to improve the flavor as pickled cabbage dominated each bite.  Moving past the buns to things far superior it was next in Graze's signature curds that I did partake and squeaky-as-hell with plenty of brine I greedily dipped each bite in ranch - a flavor I generally dislike adding an aromatic finish to each bite.  No less impressed by a salty pretzel with delicate chew beneath a soft, golden top it was back to the charcuterie that I turned as plates were collected and opting for one of three desserts another long delay would transpire, the twenty minutes thankfully justified by a hot slice of pie loaded with nuts and molten caramel atop a crisp and buttery crust.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cmv6wUUe-H0xRiFEY0__iQ"}

Having heard countless times that I don't know what I'm missing in passing up these places I guess I'm simply afraid that a menu without something that really catches my attention could prevent me from ever going back and as such I searched for a plan B for dinner-before-dinner and instead ended up with dessert before dinner-before-dinner at Lee's Cream Liqueur where I would not only meet Lee herself, but also have some rather excellent ice cream.\n\nApparently more of a side job/pet business than full-time gig for Lee, the \"Cream Liqueur\" concept admittedly seemed a bit strange to me at first, but with Lee explaining her ideas and time spent formulating the recipes I decided a taste or two wouldn't hurt and with stomach capacity plus $5 to spare a few bites of Pumpkin Pie Brandy, Cinnamon Bun Brandy, and Caramel Pecan Tequila would all prove interesting enough (and the latter two quite delicious) to justify a full order - one scoop of Carrot Cake Irish Whiskey and one of Red Velvet Scotch.\n\nNow, having admitted already that I quite liked what I tasted, I will note to purists or mavens that the texture of Lee's Cream is somewhat atypical, an effect of a blending process that that allows the booze to freeze while also using mix-ins like cake and cookies, but if this doesn't bother you then the flavors are great.  Beginning first with the Red Velvet, I loved the chocolate and scotch combination while bits of frosting added needed sweetness to the mix and moving next to the carrot cake - it tasted like a great spice cake, complete with raisins and nuts, mixed with something akin to Bailey's - it was definitely the favorite of those I tried and even if not the most technically proficient ice cream, all in all a nice idea and an interesting change of pace.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qB-qsaSnhbHCt18_AN4Quw"}

With service swift it was only a matter of minutes before selections began to arrive, the first a superlative $8 milkshake thick with caramel and rife with vanilla but topped with copious whipped cream to mask what I'd guess to be an 8oz serving, a trend carried over to each plate that followed as large prices met small portions thankfully bolstered by bold flavors.  Starting sweet and following with savory due to a kitchen miscalculation it should be noted that each of Brenner's pure chocolates are well sourced, smooth, and complex by the bar and as such both white and milk versions only served to improve the Custard French toast and Soft Cookie, the later on par with that of New York's fabled Levain Bakery in terms of taste and texture (though at 2.5x the price) and while I think everyone would have been happier to see the Croquettes first I'd be lying if I didn't say they were my favorite bite of the meal - the paprika and manchego working smoky, savory magic on the lightly fried kernels.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_CHH9KN1bO5cs_GHjQ-r1A"}

Highly regarded on Yelp! and reported to be committed to local high quality ingredients the small shop was a brief detour and, honestly, how often do I have a car at my disposal in Las Vegas?  Opening at 7am we woke early, loaded the car, and arrived at the restaurant at 7:05 - so early the coffee hadn't even finished brewing.\n\nEntering the restaurant we were greeted sleepily by a young Hispanic woman at the front and seated by a young Hispanic man who would also act as our server throughout the meal.  With water poured menus were delivered and once coffee and tea were optioned for we were told it would be a few moments as water was still boiling and coffee still brewing.  Low on d\u00e9cor we sat back and watched highlights of DeSean Jackson lighting up the Giants on the plasma screen until the young man returned with beverages and took our orders.\n\nWith quality service throughout the meal - coffee refilled frequently and water never empty - we watched the restaurant slowly fill to half capacity while we waited...and from my vantage point I watched the kitchen, a two man operation running the griddles and grills with great speed and skill.  With the time just shy of 7:30 our plates would arrive - each warm, well prepared, and accompanied with appropriate toppings in small plastic cups.\n\nThe first plate, ordered by my sister, was the short stack of Peanut Butter and \"make your own combination!\" pancakes - in her case banana and chocolate.  Served with maple syrup the pancakes were decent but not spectacular - a mild peanut butter taste within and chopped bananas and chocolate chips atop.\n\nMy aunt's selection, a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles and served with cream cheese syrup would fare better than my sister's choice, albeit largely only because of the syrup.  Cocoa tinged, thin, and somewhat crisp on the exterior the pancakes themselves were tasty while the addition of the chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation and the whipped cream was expectedly sweet.  In the cup, imagine a mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned out - a great idea that worked nicely on both this dish and my selection.  As we'd be dining on Red Velvet pancakes for the next two days I feel obligated to note that these were the worst of the group by a large margin.\n\nFor my choice, Carrot Cakes - certainly the most interesting of our pancake selections with shredded carrots and pecans studding the batter.  Topped with more crumbled pecans and the same lovely syrup served with the red velvet options I actually enjoyed my short stack quite a bit and was glad I'd opted for less food so I could sample some of my mother's choice - the best of the meal.\n\nTitled Honey Toast and described as \"two pieces of thick sliced honey toast dipped in a farm fresh egg wash and cooked to perfection! Then drizzled with sweet honey. Yummy!\" I will have to agree with Babycake's assessment - they were prefect and yummy.  Significant in size and heft the two thick slices of toast were perfectly caramelized on the exterior and custard within while the slowly melting whipped cream and honey proved to be a smooth and sweet balance without being overly saccharine.  While superfluous, I will note the house syrup was actually quite good - it reminded me of the Sweet Syrup at Camellia Grill in New Orleans.\n\nSettling the modest bill - a mere $7.50/each with tax and tip - at the front before making our way to the car we were bid farewell and told to come back soon.  While I'll admit that in retrospect I rather wish we'd have simply gotten some pastries for the road, I certainly did not dislike Babycakes - it just wasn't worth the special trip.

Not realizing that the space served food in addition to coffee I was greeted by a young lady at the bar who asked if I wanted a menu or if I knew what I'd like I deferred for a moment while I perused the options - eventually settling on an iced Toddy and a pair of pastries made in-house that morning - a $10 tab including a $1 tip.\n\nWith the space almost intentionally run-down looking and tables, benches, and chairs strewn throughout three rooms I found bench and 2 tables near the back where a defunct piano sat alongside a family of four and after getting out my books took my first sip of the Toddy - a rich blend from Cartel with a bit of stone-fruit up front and deep chocolate notes on the finish before moving on to my pastries - a $2.50 Strawberry \"DohNut\" and a $4.00 slice of Dr. Pepper Cake.  Beginning first with the donut - a small ring that was possibly baked rather than fried given the total lack of grease, rich cake-like texture, and pockets of berries plus an ample coat of not-too-sweet strawberry glaze I have to say the it was more 'muffin' than donut, but all in all it was still quite good.  Moving next to the cake - dense, fudgy, and just bitter enough between the cocoa and the nuts to balance the saccharine sweetness of the soda it has been a long long time since I ordered something as simple as \"chocolate cake\" and while there is no doubt I could have made something like this at home it was a really nice reminder of how good 'comfort food' can sometimes be - particularly with really good coffee in a relaxed setting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5ambRqdTJt9vGwFzVI9HBw"}

Seated on entry and presented with menus, water, and gratuitously refilled fair trade coffee (bring your own artificial sweetener if you don't fancy stevia) from a pleasant and efficient woman named Joanna who was seemingly running the show solo the meal most certainly started out well...at least until the food arrived.\n\nFeaturing a frequently changing selection of items based on what is fresh and local I have to commend Tryst for offering a multitude of options catering to a variety of dietary restrictions, but on the whole the only item which was tasted that really impressed was the French Toast; a hard to mess up amalgam of rich peanut butter and jam on eggy brioche that was pan seared golden and quite good even though the fruit cup lacked flavor aside from the overwhelming melon.\n\nMoving past the toast, I guess the tots were as good as you can do with fried potatoes - a light sweetness, though some a bit overcooked - but the flavorless and watery ham on the Monte Cristo and the single ring of too-dull-to-taste Pineapple cooked into the base of a pancake no better than Bisquick left much to be desired.

Never one to skimp on sweets, particularly in belated celebration of my friend's birthday, it was with the new \"Un-Birthday\" cake that our meal concluded and featuring layers of dense cake juxtaposing smooth frosting in a portion large enough for four suffice it to say that the $15 charge is warranted, a rarity on any Block 16 menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

Located in the West Tower with ornate chandeliers, ample glass, and plenty of shine it would be easy to say that Wicked Spoon is the 'nicest' buffet in which I have dined but with expansive size as well as selection - over 150 items offered at $38 for brunch - it would be equally fair to suggest the immaculately clean space also represents one of The Strip's biggest \"bangs for the buck\" as a team of chefs spread across several open kitchens work diligently replenishing each station with ornate small plates at a speed that would put all but the most seasoned short-order cook to shame.  Expeditious and friendly in service with purified water on the table and good coffee refilled nearly every time a plate was cleared it was with a focus on variety that I explored the various stations of Wicked Spoon and although not every dish was a success I'd say 85% of the sixty-six items I sampled were at least good while a few far exceeded expectations.  Starting sweet then veering savory and subsequently switching back-and-forth as new plates emerged from the kitchen items such as the fresh fruit pastries immediately showed the strength of the pastry department and while chocolate options proved a touch heavy handed the gelato selection was stunning, the 'white chocolate coffee' and pistachio both on par with Art of Flavors in terms of texture and nuance.  Moving past disappointing Italian and Asian fare aside from swoon-inducing sweet polenta, well accompanied congee, and caramelized pork belly as well as duck it was on to more brunch-oriented offerings that I turned and while both the benedict and slab bacon shined the macaroni and chicken were merely decent - clever titles aside.  Largely skipping salads aside from the impressive beets but impressed by fruits, cheese, cereals, and charcuterie it was finally at the three-hour mark that I'd finally filled up and having already once sampled the delightful custard soaked Pullman it was to creativity I turned; two slices of the buttery cinnamon bread buried beneath a mountain of house-whipped Chantilly cream, Maple Syrup, Dates, and Granola far outperforming any 'designer' French Toast you'd pay $15 for elsewhere in the city.  \n\nUnable to compare Wicked Spoon to other Vegas buffets given my relative inexperience with the genre I can only say I was stunned by not only the quality of the food but the passion behind the project.  In a world of \"China Buffets\" and Golden Corral's where neither presentation nor preparation seems to matter, let alone freshness or sourcing, Wicked Spoon chooses to function like a proper small-plates restaurant with sparkling cleanliness to compliment a trained Chef's vision.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  With an entryway shaped like Buddha and \"Mexican Takeout\" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  With an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from Chinese Opera Masks and Lanterns to Luchador Masks and Oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  In addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant Chinese and Mexican individuals.  To see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.\n\nArriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from Langosta.  Described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol chile sauce ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and I felt the chile sauce overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.\n\nSilencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  Unfamiliar with rambutan until this time I was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  While not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.\n\nThe Cochinita tacos, described as Yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   Savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.\n\nCarnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  With the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  Tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.\n\nCoctel de Camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  Essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.\n\nLove Is In the Air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  Nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an \"mg\" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.\n\nLamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  While slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the m\u00e9lange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both Hispanic and Chinese cultures.\n\nOcean Nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  With crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not I don't think I'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.\n\nThe Unruly Monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the Ocean Nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local Chinese restaurant in most mid-sized US cities.\n\nIn the end I think the verdict is still out on China Poblano - I'm not willing to rule it out, but I'm also not ready to say the \"concept\" (which is exactly what it is) \"works.\"  While certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of Americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  Looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit I already see many changes and given Andres' propensity for exploration I've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cMvN1j-LK64zqmT4vnl8NA"}

First of all, the room will be dramatic and the service will be exemplary.  Second, there will be ingredients you have never heard of presented in manners you never imagined.  Third, there will be a point in the meal where there are at least four plates resting in front of you and you'll have no idea where to start.  Fourth, chances are good that there will be at least one plate that leaves you scratching your head wondering \"what were they thinking?\"  Last of all - the other ten to fifteen plates will not only be delicious, they'll make you wonder \"why didn't anyone think of that before?\"\n\nUnderstanding that Twist is high risk and high reward in a city where a gamble is the very basis of the economy is part of the experience and while the reward may not come in the form of a financial windfall the cost of admission at the restaurant newly helmed by Ryuki Kawasaki comes with myriad rewards in the form of cuisine like no other in Sin City - a foie gras dish exploring both bitter and sweet, then bringing it to a peak with super-sweet ice cream only to follow-up with a firey finish being the most impressive example while a brandade dish marring salt and earth elegantly only to leave a sweet, vegetal note on the palate somewhat akin to pumpkin pie also wowed.  To the other end - the true risk taker of the evening came with dessert as the nearly unpalatably bitter grapefruit, champagne, and pepper cocktail was served front and center completely overwhelming the palate only to be followed by five additional sweets stimulating the rest of the palate and completing the vision.\n\nCertainly not a restaurant or meal for those happy to dine at a buffet in order to get back to the craps table Twist is a place to sit, think, enjoy the scenery and the service, and embrace the chef's vision - it is like no other place in Vegas, and all-in it remains my favorite restaurant in the city.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uYKwS-biARKgBkk5rY_PaQ"}

Steeped in the stream of consciousness characteristic to Gagnaire but reigned in and refined to razor sharp precision under the eye of Ryuki Kawasaki it was with expected flare that each course was delivered as a collection of plates and with bold, familiar flavors frequently reinvented by subtle nuance the meal unfolded as a slow moving dialogue without the traditional light-to-heavy structure, instead designing each plate as a segue both forward and back with growing complexity defining progress to the final savory before finally breaking pace for a special request I'll likely never forget - a tall, proud souffl\u00e9 for the ages first imbued and then crowned with the last of the season's white truffles.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uYKwS-biARKgBkk5rY_PaQ"}

With Gagnaire himself present in the kitchen - as well as the dining room, bar, and even lobby - tending to details both small and large it was to an array of innovative canap\u00e9s plus a quintet of breads with butters from Isigny and Echire that we began and moving next through six courses of meticulous sourcing and style rare would be a lull, a full emersion in the kitchen's stream of consciousness with a leisurely flowing pace. Opting for one tasting and courses a la carte to match 'Spring' began with flavors smacking of the season and although mushrooms both here and later were slightly over-seasoned everything else showed fresh and vibrant, a concept that carried right along to the course that followed - a flood of foie gras comprising seared, salad, torchon, terrine, and even ice cream.  Transitioning to 'surf n' turf' in an eight plate third course of butter poached lobster juxtaposing aggressively peppered beef before progressing to five cheeses novel to even the experienced it was at last in two separate courses that sweets arrived and with Gagnaire himself overseeing the pastry preparation that evening every item arrived with a flourish; a garnish here or an extra plate there to cap another stunning meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uYKwS-biARKgBkk5rY_PaQ"}

A bustling restaurant, but not a particularly \"loud\" one despite filling to capacity before we made our exit service was every bit as professional as expected and with drinks readily refilled the kitchen moved efficiently sending out our selections in three courses with excellent timing as the meal kicked off with a bread basket not quite as lovely as the salumi bread at Scarpetta, but warm with a truly impressive Focaccia which I had to mindful to resist after the first slice.\n\nMoving on to the proper plates, the first course arrived as a half order of thick, toothsome pici topped with a truffle-laden sauce of tomato and duck confit that was expectedly rustic and rich while its counterpart, the oft raved Filone with a poached duck egg sitting atop cheese fondue was equally rich but ever more refined, the silky mix of egg and cheese atop hot bread without a doubt the best dish of a meal full of good choices.  Following the appetizers, a main course of steak with a side of fries was pronounced by my friend to be good, but not $62 good while the $22 Margherita featured top quality ingredients and great char, but failed to reach the highs of the pie at Due Forni which cost substantially less.\n\nUnwilling/Unable to pass on dessert despite another full meal in just a couple of hours the early evening at D.O.C.G. ended with the house specialty Salted Caramel Budino and yes, without a doubt, this is a signature dessert worth the rave reviews as the dense pudding walks a fine line between too sweet and too salty with bits of toffee acting as a textural contrast; it would have been great with coffee and along with the filone is reason enough to pay D.O.C.G. a visit (even with the exorbitant on-strip markup)", "type": "review", "business_id": "wZxrcIHmkhT4OHvIxPwd_A"}

For my third and last pastry stop on this tour of the Valley I just so happened to be wandering the Scottsdale Fashion Square before lunch at Cowboy Ciao and opted to stop into The Herb Box based on the recommendation of a friend.\n\nFirst approaching the upstairs restaurant, at this point thriving with Saturday brunchers, the space is admittedly gorgeous looking out on the river and after browsing the menu (note to self, red velvet pancakes and a divine sounding BLT with ricotta) I subsequently made my way down to the basement bakery, caf\u00e9, coffee shop, and wine store.  Greeted on entering by a young lady behind the counter who asked if she could get a beverage ready for me while I waited I agreed to a large iced coffee while I weighed my options; a bevy  of muffins, scones, pastries, and desserts totaling at least forty - some standard and some entirely unique but all but a few desirable.  Deciding once again to choose one for myself and to rely on my server for the second choice my options were boxed, then bagged, and paying the $13 tab with tax and tip I made my way back to the street.\n\nBeginning first with my selection, a tossup between the Red Velvet Cake and Bread Pudding, the pudding always wins and in this case my selection of Vanilla Bean Bread Pudding with Peach and Peaches n' Cream Glaze would prove to be the best bread pudding of the trip not only in its present cool state, but even more so the following day after reheating.  Dense and packed with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and most of all vanilla juxtaposing studs of sliced peaches this \"pudding\" was nearly cakelike in its texture and when topped with the glaze - a dense anglaise with more cinnamon and the fructose sweetness of peaches serving as top notes - it was simply outstanding.\n\nMoving next to my server's suggestion, another dish billed as \"best thing ever,\" this is one circumstance where I can actually say that at that very moment I felt like she may have been right because as good as my Bread Pudding had been, the adult Ding Dong was all the better.  Beginning first with a dense chocolate cake made with dark Dutch processed cocoa, the base of this dessert was clearly sour cream based and all the better for it as the slight flavors melded perfectly.  Moving next to the \"cream filling\" in this case replaced with a nearly liquid white chocolate marshmallow cream the sweetness was a perfect balance to the cake while the entirety of the dessert was encased in a dense dark chocolate shell flecked with blue edible glitter.  A masterpiece both visually, texturally, and in terms of flavor I'd not hesitate to call this one of the best \"upscale\" takes on American Retail comfort food I've ever had (notwithstanding Cathal Armstrong's Foie Gras Twinkie, of course.)\n\nDoing my best to restrain myself from eating the entirety of both before the following day while carrying the bag from store to store in order to prevent melting in the hot Arizona Sun all I know now is that my next visit to Phoenix/Scottsdale will see me with breakfast or brunch at The Herb Box and desserts from the caf\u00e9 below (that may or may not make it out the door, but certainly not to the following day.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "jRfdz5voj40P6WS9L54caw"}

Serving largely as a gastropub, of sorts, and with a menu laden with all sort of upscaled American comfort food it really was not WHAT Citizen Public House is doing that would end up wowing, but rather how well they do it.\n\nGreeted and seated at a table near the window where our server, Clark, would stop by frequently throughout the evening to make sure we were never for want of anything, menus were present on arrival and with little effort we both honed in on appetizers, mains, and desserts that fit our palates perfectly - honestly, I don't know if I have ever seen a rather short menu put together so many things I like in a trio of plates - and when these plates arrived each were as good as they read.\n\nMore or less a collection of small plates featuring big flavors the meal began with soft pita and grassy olive oil before moving into spiral pasta thick with cheese and balanced with bright tomatoes alongside crispy chicken over a toothsome waffle that could have easily fit the role of breakfast or dessert as well as an appetizer.  Next up, a plate of tender and rosy duck given texture not by crisp skin but rather crunchy pistachios and millet nearly the texture of mashed potatoes tinged with rosemary and bitter greens.  Not to be outdone, my mother's meatloaf was rich and artistically plated; a classic texture made unique with rich herbal/earthy notes to balance the briny demi-glace and pork.\n\nHeading to the home stretch and opting to outsource sweets to Tracey Dempsey, a wise move made by many local kitchens, I think I can confidently say that what landed before me was good but what was presented to my mother is a dish she still talks about today - a layer-by-layer temporal change in texture and flavor that was not quite a budino or a pot de cr\u00e8me, nor a parfait - just a decadent sweet-meets-salty amalgam that was truly amongst the ten best desserts I enjoyed in 2012; a reason in and of itself to visit Citizen Public House...amongst many others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA"}

Pricey to be sure, part due to the luxury ingredients and part due to the location and exclusivity, this was one of those reservations that required a signed contract and pre-payment and the sort that came with great anticipation...it even came with a golden ticket just to get you in the door...and it was worth it.\n\nWithout a doubt one of my five best meals in 2012 the eve of Christmas Eve bled into the early hours of the 24th as I sat with one other man from Arizona and a family of six from the Carolinas as Andres and his team sent out twenty three courses of elegant, fun, and mostly delicious cuisine ranging from a meringue of squash that disappeared like a magic trick in the mouth flooding the palate with the intense perfume of truffles to a thick slice buttery foie gras rendered refreshing though the use of citrus juxtaposing dark chocolate.\n\nPresented by a kitchen of four acting as both chefs and servers while the ma\u00eetre d made his way around the room pouring exotic wines (a $200+ pairing) for my dining partners and unlimited bottled water (a mere $8) for myself service throughout the experience was truly exemplary - each dish with a story and inspiration described at length and timing impeccable.  Surely adding to the meal were the strangers with whom I dined, the wine taking its toll and everyone joyful in the season, and no more so than when the kitchen passed around a porron before dessert - myself missing a few drops at the beginning but performing admirably while some did far better...and some FAR worse...as everyone laughed along.\n\nHaving enjoyed thinkfoodgroup's food in the past but generally not the service \u00e9 by Jose Andres turned out to be everything I'd hoped for; a truly memorable meal that warrants both the price and the praise - a rarity in fine dining, particularly in Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rYXu8NasDNnLZrmHymaQWg"}

Featuring a wide variety of baked goods and imports both sweet and savory straight out of Deutschland at prices representing a veritable bargain compared to many of the area's artisan bakeries it was plain on entry to the small shop that things were bound to be good when I heard staff and patrons communicating nearly exclusively in German and with no less than two dozen offerings available the only difficulties presented by German Bread Bakery was not ordering too much...eventually settling on a mere five selections at a total of $10.89.  Focused on the classics, particularly those most familiar to me growing up to a Hungarian-German heritage, it was with an apple strudel that my tasting began and reheated quickly in the microwave I'd strongly suggest others do the same, the result a light trickle of butter running from the flaky dough as fresh apples and light sweetness found balance in hefty cinnamon notes and delicate pastry.  Moving next to two almond options it was perhaps an effect of my 2pm arrival that the sole remaining bear claw was found to be a bit doughy though the frangipane was well utilized and moving on to the laminated layers of the almond twist I'd wager that no better exists in the city, a light glaze overlying toasted almonds as each shattering bite made a mess of my table and floor, a similar result found in the signature 'pretzel croissant' as buttery salted layers gave way to a soft crumb speckled with seeds and flavors harkening the Bavarian classic but ever more delicate.  Last but certainly not least, my final taste of German Bread Bakery on this day was the classic Bienenstich - a dish rarely found but always astounding when done well and in this case done perfectly with light vanilla pastry cream proving a marvelous balance to rich almond/honey/butter crunch topping all anchored by the yeasty yellow cake - a must order more than worth a trip to both fans and those (unfortunately) not yet familiar.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bsurBnPwOHcz8ATxzgxcEA"}

A surprisingly large space with earth tones, wood, and Edison bulbs serving as decoration while two Neapolitano brick ovens dominate the back half of the restaurant turning out both Roman and Neapolitan pies our arrival found the restaurant almost entirely empty and within moments we were seated, a young man named Eric proving a competent if not slightly overzealous server.\n\nWanting to see what the restaurant had to offer both from the ovens and the kitchen I was given the charge of ordering while my friend enjoyed a $24 flight of hefty reds and with so few patrons at 2:00pm our pizzas arrived quickly, a superlative Margherita with oozing puddles of imported mozzarella and bright, assertive tomato sauce beneath a slick of olive oil and basil followed by a crisp and crackling 500F Roman  style pie with tomatoes replaced by a creamy egg intermingling with rich, smoky duck and strong notes of red onion.  Generally a fan of more blister and bubble on my Neapolitan but thoroughly impressed by the ingredient quality of both pies I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite, though I imagine a Margherita Roman with some Prosciutto would be perfect.\n\nUnable to resist gnocchi, whether flour or potato, an order of this semolina iteration arrived alongside the duck confit and although rich and plentiful with great texture I personally found the dish to be a touch too saline and a bit heavy on truffle oil - the sort of dish that probably would have benefitted by a glass of something dry and white - and ending on the \"RICH\" theme I'll simply say that anyplace willing to serve a cup full of sweetened cheese topped with honey and nuts as dessert is worth visiting in my book...smoky, creamy, sweet - definitely a must order, and perfect with coffee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RFqDK2b5mpasIuAzDoDdDg"}

or even on - Las Vegas Boulevard despite the limitations of a kitchen smaller than that of most Summerlin homes, Due Forni remains a sort of 'secret' in the growing shadow of too many imports and chains.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RFqDK2b5mpasIuAzDoDdDg"}

Featuring an extensive menu of Japanese classics arranged under headings such as grilled, steamed, and fried plus a handful of daily specials as Chef Komada watched over a team of four in the open kitchen it was with an eye toward variety that we placed our order and with a complimentary cocktail to begin nearly every one of our nine items proved excellent, particularly considering a total bill inclusive of tip less than $30 per person.  Starting first with cold selections and then proceeding through those grilled and hot it was with impeccable skill that traditional options like robatayaki, grilled squid, and chawanmushi shined but far more interesting and thus more impressive were items trending toward esoteric, both the hot and cold mountain potato dishes absolute show stoppers in terms of texture and flavor while tempura selections proved innovative and light.  Moving on to dessert, a decision left in my hands, a selection two sweets arrived and while the tofu mousse was admittedly quite light the general lack of flavor proved rather underwhelming in its own regard and all the more so next to a pair of crispy yet supple matcha spiked waffles topped with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream and sidecars of liquid butter and honey, the end effect every bit as delicious as the Honey Toast at Ichiza or Serenade but with a slight bitter undertone adding a touch of intrigue, an upgrade on a classic that seems to typify much of the restaurant's cuisine and all the more reason to come back soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h83afVKqwBlA-zOu_vdtEw"}

A small space situated next to apparent brunch favorite \"The Windsor\" I admittedly drove right past the small shop at first due to the lack of signage but catching my mistake quickly I took a right and then found myself at the complimentary valet who assured me he could either park my car - or that I could take one of the fifteen minute spots in front of Churn, a much more logical option.\n\nDisembarking from the car and making my way past a family through the doors it was no more than 5 seconds after I entered the door that I was greeted by a friendly woman and with kitsch and candy dominating the space outside the case I was offered a taste of \"any and all\" that eventually turned into a taste of Vietnamese Coffee, Toasted Coconut, Butter Pecan, Double Chocolate, and Peaches and Honey Ice creams as well as a Peanut Butter Bar.  With the textures very creamy, almost like gelato, and fresh flavors focused on subtlety without being excessively sweet - particularly the peaches and honey as well as the toasted coconut - I will admit that making a decision of two flavors in a cup/cone vs. a cookie sandwich was tough but in the end I just couldn't pass up a fresh baked Snicker Doodle and Chocolate Chip cookie wrapped around Butter Pecan.\n\nBeginning first with the ice cream, I will admit that overall I probably enjoyed the flavor (and novelty) of the peaches and honey a bit more than the butter pecan, but when taking into account what would work best with the baked goods the subtle toasty notes of the butter pecan won me over along with the texture - like thickened almond butter without chunks or whole pecans at all.  Moving next to the cookies, I would have probably deferred had it not been for the Snickerdoodle but rife with cinnamon and butter I simply couldn't pass up my favorite childhood baked good while the chocolate chip was also good, but certainly not better than those made by my aunt or many other bakeries.

While Veganism may not be a lifestyle for everyone I'm confident to say that Mayra could satisfy any palate if given the chance while the small staff does everything they can for each guest, even going so far as to plate my bread pudding because she noticed I was taking pictures before boxing it up to go, the dense cinnamon bread soaked through with spicy cider and skin-on apple compote proving a perfect dessert after Lotus of Siam that afternoon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MRUsPIVywMFDZHbfDa6YjA"}

Owned and operated by pastry chef Stephanie Labelle, a former student of Herme at his Paris flagship the newish space was reportedly quaint according to my friend who recommended it, while the pastries were apparently quite the opposite.\n\nClosed Mondays (when we were just down the street at Fromentier) and opening at 11:00am on Tuesday we entered the shop just as they opened and with Labelle and her team just filling the racks our selection was quite limited for a moment so we sat down and browsed the cute space full of knick knacks before the daily display was available and after browsing, chatting with the chef, and weighing or options we each chose an entement while my mother opted for a quartet of macarons before we returned to the car, eating as we walked.\n\nBeginning first with the less interesting items, a simple carrot cake was presented as a tall cylinder topped with the lightest cream cheese frosting yet to touch my lips and rife with both carrots and pineapples plus a touch of nuts it was toothsome and quite nice.  Equally nice, a small bar of lemon meringue tarte was the epitome of smoothness with the light meringue and dense lemon forming a lovely mouthfeel atop a crisp butter crust.  Citrus based and thus appealing to my mother, the most interesting aspect of this dish to me was the addition of candied lemon peel and a touch of mint, both subtle but present and giving the dish a sort of freshness that I hadn't expected.  \n\nMoving next to the Macarons, only two flavors were available so early in the morning at Rhubarbe and with one lemon and the other maple chocolate walnut it was easy to know who would rave what, though admittedly both were quite good as the crisp cookies gave way to intense fillings, the first nicely sweetened to balance the sour and the second a dense ganache that actually helped to temper the maple rich exterior...or at least seemingly maple-rich until we tasted our last option - a Maple Religeuse with dense impeccable choux stuffed to bursting with rich maple custard and topped with lightly toasted maple sugar plus a crown of impossibly light whipped cream.  One part crunch, one part cream, and over the top sweet this certainly wasn't a pastry for everyone, but for me it was a perfect marriage of traditional French technique and Montreal's most famous ingredient...a must taste to anyone visiting the city who loves both.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q29W3sXrv4U6VVC1Xx4J2Q"}

Clearly a restaurant vested in its core with a menu infrequent to change it was in a duo of 'sides' that my meal began and although bland plantains dripping with excess grease quickly proved inedible the unlikely star of the show would in fact be the wood-grilled pigskins, a crispy exterior overlying supple fat with intense brine offset by tender chunks of fried yucca.  Moving next to a pair of arepas it was with the wood grilled chicken that I started yet with flavors no better than the frozen stuff from Roots sold at Walmart I quickly moved to the pork-butt, the flavor almost indistinguishable from the bird as a trickle of oil ran down my hand into the napkin below.  At this point tossing what was left of each sandwich to instead sample the rinds and root with accompanying sauces it was finally with the $2 Pastelito that I finished and although tasty enough to stand on its own I couldn't help but think that for a buck per bite I'd have been better off staying next door with another scoop of gelato.", "type": "review", "business_id": "blgSBn3CimrCHn2SuZvcZw"}

Obviously a small space, and one not particularly easily identified from the street despite large billboards located down the street, it was just prior to 2:00pm that I entered the small Cuban bakery and with several folks seated and eating I took my time to peruse the options, a middle-age woman keeping a watchful eye on me until I was ready to go, my $10 order of one savory and three seats delivered to the table with a cup of water just five minutes thereafter.  Beginning first with the pork croquette sandwich, a pair of fried sticks filled with what I can best describe as 'pig puree' proving an acquired taste beneath tomatoes and Swiss cheese, I only ate one half before satisfying my curiosity and moving onward the guava-cream cheese pocket was indulged in similarly - a nice enough flavor, though most would find bottom of the wastebasket as I'd have simply preferred it more flaky and warm.  To this point largely underwhelmed it was onward to the meal's two best selections that I moved and although the 'cappucino' was two lovely bites of sponge cake rife with simple syrup it simply could not compare to the eggy custard flan, a world-class example with a lightly browned top and pockets of raisins amidst a sea of lightly sugared eggs.\n\nSmall, cozy, and pleasant in service Roly's is one of the few places where locals are able to indulge in Cuban baked goods, but with a limited selection and too much focus on 'everything to everyone' items like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, cupcakes, and tiramisu I'd have rather see them focus on more esoteric specialties like Porto's in Los Angeles - the lack of several items, including the tres leches, in portions smaller than a full tray was particularly disappointing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WQBp1GfsYOuOqqym8xq3RQ"}

With a retail shop located on North Buffalo and items featured in several of Sin City's most celebrated resorts it was just past 8:30am when I entered the small storefront and immediately greeted by a young woman happy to engage in conversation, answer questions, and offer samples I must say I was immediately impressed - the cozy confines with shabby chic seating awash in sunlight reflecting off stainless steel cases and glass domes beneath rustically styled crystal chandeliers.  Amused by anecdotes of customers who drive excessive distances to get their gluten-free fix and pleased to hear that the recent trend of 'intolerance' and fad diets has only served to help raise awareness for those who truly suffer from the disease it was with bites of rich chocolate cake and coffee soaked tiramisu that my impression of Beau Monde began to form and eventually crafting a small order of personal favorites to the tally of $16.72 I took my items to go, the quartet consumed with coffee throughout the hours between breakfast and lunch - neither of which were remotely gluten free.  Taking into account my personal predilection for cakes over cookies and quick breads over savory options such as Beau Monde's oft-raved flatbreads or tortilla it was with a small banana muffin that my tasting began and unfortunately finding the fruit's flavor far too subtle while the texture was somewhat akin to a sponge I was happy to quickly discover that this was the exception rather than the rule, each of the following selections proving every bit as good as more 'traditional' versions - the pumpkin cake dense and full of spice beneath lightly sweetened frosting while the brownie was rich and creamy with the tooth of a flourless chocolate cake draped in bold, bitter ganache.  At this point appropriately impressed it was finally the Pecan Pie that I approached with wide eyes and utilizing a thin, crisp shell to house toasted nuts tossed in molasses laced with brown sugar the result succeeded where so many others fail, the sweetness present without overwhelming the subtleties of smoke and butter while the texture was not 'sticky' in the least.\n\nNo more expensive than the artisan goods at Bouchon, Payard, Chocolate and Spice, or several other local bakeries while entirely outperforming overrated spots like Patisserie Manon it is truly a challenge for someone who isn't afflicted with some form of gluten intolerance, whether real or assumed, to appreciate just how important a bakery like Beau Monde truly is, yet try as I might I'm happy to say that all-in-all the results were impressive...and not just for 'gluten free' products either, but for baked goods as a whole.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qHqb3Kdy6hWx2oDWZkQu0A"}

With coffee prepared and limited options for sweetener (muscovado sugar or Agave nectar only) I opted to drink it black and sipping the brew the flavor was spot on to what I appreciate - velvety, cocoa tinged, and a bit of cherry and almond.

Less successful, the honey bun was simply a case of an item sitting on the counter for too long - the flavor fine but the yeasted dough already getting weighed down by the ample, rich toppings.\n\nMoving to more savory options, the restaurant's signature Wafflewich would prove to be every bit as delicious as any sandwich crafted of similar high quality ingredients but literally drowned with creamy Bechamel I personally would have preferred the waffles to be a bit more crisp, perhaps even a bit 'crunchy' for texture...but I have to say the rosemary was an inspired touch to what was otherwise a well executed croque madame and although I'm not sure I would call Bread and Butter a 'destination' bakery I'd certainly return if driving up from Phoenix again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ieYiud3trM-9e7E8YUhK0g"}

Available 7:00am to 9:30pm I've had them at both ends of the spectrum and honestly prefer them to any frozen \"shake\" I've had save for, perhaps, the concretes at Shake Shack - the pumpkin was particularly excellent as part of breakfast.\n\nMoving to the baked goods, as much as I wanted to like the donuts I just could not, save for the baked zucchini version and the dense blueberry fritters.  Perhaps it was the glaze or perhaps the actual batter but something about each of them harkened that 'beany' flavor that turns so many off to soy based vegan foods.  More impressive, perhaps due to the intense sweetness or a different glaze, the cinnamon roll was a much better choice, as was the turnover with a light flakey shell, sweet whipped soy, and fresh blueberry puree.\n\nMoving on to the rest - I think it is safe to say that anything nami makes with chocolate is a safe bet - the rich organic tablets behind the bar likely 70% cocoa or better and a dominant flavor whether in a tsoynami, drizzled on a pancake, baked into a moist cupcake, or best of all made into dense \"snickers\" fudge that trumps the original by miles.\n\nLast, and certainly not least, for those who don't want chocolate - and all the more so for those unfortunate enough to be gluten intolerant (the real sort, not the trendy Hollywood stuff,) get the Yankee Doodle - a nearly quarter pound snicker doodle sandwich with dense, creamy filling, that is better than any snickerdoodle I've had elsewhere - vegan, veg, gluten free, or otherwise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZEdaJ8mcMpPiFWgDuSPqeA"}

Impossible to decide between the square or the round crust based on quality as both were excellent in Brooklyn our eventual decision was based entirely on the fact that the square pie is only available in a large size and although perhaps not as well seasoned in terms of the bright acidity of the tomatoes or robust herbal notes of the basil the crust at DeMarco's was every bit that of the version at DiFara's, lightly raised and golden with a light crumb and pleasant yeasty notes serving as a backdrop to ample cheese - undoubtedly a contender for the best pizza I've found in Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2f7TvlG5zcuMCHcQjxqS6A"}

Beginning first with a pliable soft corn tortilla and then stacking on layer after layer of aromatic mushrooms plus a mixture of cheeses both mild and slightly briny this was a dish that greeted the palate well before the tongue and while the top notes of truffle were certainly notable, it was the intensity of the corn smut sauce that really put the it over the top.\n\nQueso Fundido - Duck Barbacoa, Poblano Chile Rajas, Queso Mixto:  Transitioning from the salads and small plates portion of the menu to the tacos, the first to arrive was a DIY affair with rich and unctuous pulled duck meat buried beneath a layer of still bubbling cheese.  Slow cooked and tender with spices including (but certainly not limited to) cumin, oregano, cloves, garlic at the forefront plus plenty of heat from the mixed pepper this was an ample serving to say the least but arriving with plenty of fresh tortillas it didn't even last long enough to cool off completely.\n\nMahi-Mahi - Chipotle Remoulade, Avocado, Red Cabbage, Lime:  Having heard that this was 'the best dish on the menu' by the valet as I parked the car I have to admit I'd probably not have ordered this dish a la carte simply because I've never once had Dolphinfish that wowed me...and that would have been a mistake.  Featuring the mildly flavored fish lightly fried inside a delicate plantain batter the key to this dish was actually the juxtaposition of its accoutrements - the lightly pickled cabbage foiled by the creamy avocado while a light touch of lime brought all the flavors to a point.\n\nCochinita Pibil - Berkshire Pork Shoulder, Achiote, Pineapple BBQ:  For our 'main course' of the evening a large bowl of smoky pork would arrive with an ample description from Michael and with aromatics abound I only wished I had saved more room.  Reportedly roasted for nearly eight hours wrapped in banana leaves and subsequently braised with achiote seeds, oregano, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, sour orange, and more this was the sort of Mexican cuisine we simply don't have back in the Midwest - incredibly complex, nicely nuanced, and literally melt-in-the-mouth tender...the sort of dish that makes me want to explore the region's cuisine more and more.\n\nArroz Con Crema - Creamy Poblano Corn Rice:  Think rice pudding but make it intensely savory with plenty of spice - now make it so rich and texturally refined that all but the best risottos would pale in comparison.  At $5 this is the steal of the menu and I'm disappointed even now that I couldn't eat every bite of the cast iron pot. \n\nEl Fuerte - Flourless Chocolate Cake, Spicy Peanuts, Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse, Vanilla Bean Flan, XO Caramel, Espresso Ice Cream:  Reportedly a dish for two and although I'd have questioned this statement under normal circumstances it was not only enough for two at the end of such a long meal, but after taking my first bite definitely more than one person should rationally eat.  Essentially three squares loosely stacked and topped with GTC Espresso Ice Cream and candied peanuts dusted with chili before a tableside pour of caramel spiked (liberally) with what I believe was Patron XO Caf\u00e9 this was one rich dessert.  Dense on the bottom and light on the top with subtle differences in each bite depending on the various components sampled both Aileen and I worked on this dish slowly and bite after bite it seemed neither of us could stop until I finally threw in the napkin...at least until Aileen left a single bite on the plate and I took the bait, recollected my spoon, and finished it off.\n\nThe Verdict:  While some may piss n' moan that \"Mexican Street Food\" should be served on the streets of Mexico using less esoteric ingredients than Berkshire Pigs, Hudson Valley Ducks, and Black Truffles I'll simply beg to differ and continue my belief that any cuisine can benefit from top quality ingredients in the hands of a skilled and passionate kitchen.  Sure some may question the authenticity of Garces' restaurants or the choice location in a fancy hotel but to those of us who value things like impeccable service, comfortable environs, and the 'experience' of fine dining at a veritable bargain basement price I whole heartedly recommend giving Distrito a look - along with Bayless' Michelin starred Topolobampo it is the best Mexican food I've had to date.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lKQ5hnkSQ-XP80jNCH46nQ"}

Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a true love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "05fTEsjUPVo5jks8PpNKCQ"}

Coupling the cask ales and copious imports with a kitchen that can actually execute some fairly complex upscale pub-grub plus servers that live up to Las Vegas standards (both in looks and in attention to detail in order to justify on-strip prices and a good tip) and a willingness to turn on any game...even the lowly Tampa Bay Buccaneers and I'd say Public House is definitely a spot worth hanging out, even two days in a row.\n\nStarting in the lounge on Saturday where a scantily clad young woman named Krystian served up a number of imported lagers and decent knowledge of the province of each to my friend while providing me with the shockingly delicious recommendation of a warm wine-based cocktail to go with an ample slice of creamy duck liver served like Christmas dinner plus a creamy egg fondue that could have doubled as breakfast it really did not take much of an effort for my friend to get me to accompany him back to the pub on day two where we sat for nearly three hours as he ran through what seemed like an unthinkable amount of beers at the recommendation of a young bartender named Toshihir as I enjoyed house made pate and rillets followed by decent coffee, refilled copiously at no extra charge, and a truly inspired bread pudding as light as angel-food cake and paired with creamy apples, crunchy candied pecans, and ice cream that although hoppy on the finish opened up spicy and sweet.\n\n...dare I say that if all bars were this good I'd probably find myself going out for 'drinks' (ie, food at a drinking establishment) more often.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0i0PwU8lpj4evYKQogWxcA"}

With the Nopal a downgraded version of the egg topped item on the standard menu served only at happy hour and featuring tender cactus with a bit of salt and pepper plus queso fresco atop a four inch corn tortilla I started with it expecting it to be the most mild and as anticipated, it was quite bland.  Moving next to better options, the Barrio polo featured the same warm and tender tortilla topped with chicken, onions, green chilis, and hefty cream sauce plus Oaxaca cheese while the corn smut iteration proved to be by far the most complex and balanced of the trio, the woodsy mushrooms and aromatic shallots heavily perfumed by the huitlacoche.  All in all a good start, but certainly not the best I've tasted and skewed far to the left in terms of cost/quality.\n\nCurious as to how the pork at BQ stands up to others in the valley I next opted for the carnitas appetizer but was instead served a carnitas taco - cheaper at $3 compared to $9, but not what I'd asked for.  Not really wanting to make a fuss and figuring I could save the stomach capacity this was another decent taco - fatty pork with ample notes of marjoram, thyme, and garlic served with a light accompaniment of onions and cilantro...2 good bites, but nothing to write home about, especially when compared to what arrived with it.\n\nPresented along with the carnitas, the \"El Rey Vasito de Elote\" is apparently a signature dish and as much as one may find it hard to see corn as a signature, this is pretty darn good.  Described on the menu as sweet grilled corn in a cup topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, tapatio salsa, cilantro & lime at a cost of $5 what made the dish really shine was mostly the corn and the cotija - sweet, savory, and smoky at once with just a bit of acid to meld all the flavors.  Served solo and meant to share this dish is also offered over fries, but for my money it was best taken by the spoonful alongside other plates or wrapped in a warm tortilla, free on request.\n\nFor my final round of savories I went with one of the weekend specials and an order from the 'masa' section of the menu and having expected more small plates I certainly got more than I'd expected from both.  Beginning first with the later, a dish called Tlacoyos arrived with three mashed corn fritters topped with smoky chicken, black beans, salsa verde, oregano, pickled onions, cotija cheese and lightly sweetened cream.  Having expected something more akin to a traditional corn fritter form the $9 plate what I really liked about this open-face interpretation was once again the balance - a composition of flavors and textures akin to the Elote but tilted further to the savory yet finishing with light sweetness imparted by the cream.\n\nMoving to the biggest dish of the night the tripe and hominy soup entitled 'menudo' arrived in an enormous bowl and at a cost of $5 it was simply outstanding.  Featuring a rich tomato stock rife with offal, bones, tender hominy, and myriad spices plus a quartet of onions, cilantro, lime, and pimento pepper with which I was free to further season as I like this was a portion easily big enough for two but so good that those who love tripe should probably just order one of their own.\n\nStill with two and a half hours before dinner at this point my server again stopped by and after perusing the dessert menu I decided to end the meal with another duet, one a must order anywhere I see it and the other a must order at any Mexican restaurant but at $6 a piece I should have probably just ordered a margarita, entr\u00e9e, or another half-gallon of menudo instead.\n\nBeginning first with the rice pudding - a small bowl of relatively standard white rice with hints of cinnamon and orange subsequently dotted with golden raisins and curls of cinnamon plus, reportedly, \"Vanilla Kahlua sauce\" it would be hard to find a less flavorful dish containing such ingredients and with the rice cold and clumpy all I could do was wonder if I'd received the previous night's leftovers - a suspicion more or less confirmed when I tried the three milk cake, a dense and dry pound cake parfait made palatable only by the berries and most certainly not by the cream I can only guess came from a ready-whip can.  As a further note, where both dishes were advertised to contain nuts - specifically pecans, none were detected in either.\n\nNot one to complain except in the setting of egregious service or truly disastrous food I sat for a while with desserts unfinished watching the game still pondering how I'd spent so much on so little that impressed.  Best new restaurant?  Um - sure - for corn and tripe.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bOB11LVavtN9PWTNwR52Tw"}

Cozy and clean with modern d\u00e9cor borrowing from the CB2 catalogue it was just as the doors unlocked at seven o'clock that I made my way in and with nearly every pastry still warm from the oven a sizable order was placed, one item requiring kitchen preparation while the some were started on at a small table with the rest saved for upcoming drive.  Obviously benefitted by an early morning arrival with a full selection of fresh pastry it was in a duo of scones that my tasting began and featuring a soft crumb far more \"American\" than most Brits would prefer I'll simply say that in this case I fully support the stars and stripes, each buttery bite only lightly sweetened with berries allowed to shine.  Moving on to a golden morning bun tightly wound about a springy center of cinnamon with more than enough sugar to spare and next to coffee cake that literally melted on the tongue it was finally here that my entr\u00e9e arrived and with house-made raspberry bread rendered crisp by custard plus a hot pan my tastebuds swooned, a duo of fruits dueling for center stage while streusel added a bit of crunch.  Taking halves of each scone to the car along with chocolate wafers sandwiching smooth cream it was perhaps my lone regret that I did not order more - the \"World Peace\" cookie, Blueberry Pie, and Oat Fudge bar all appearing tempting as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NVxVxIejYzTYC0Pykia91A"}

Undoubtedly a place where kitsch finds prominence but where classics and good diner-service also stand strong it was admittedly with much debate that decisions were made on a menu where no less than a dozen sweet selections and numerous interesting savories plus specials reside but with coffee free flowing a plan was eventually hatched - two sweets, one savory, yes bacon, no potatoes, and much sharing after a short wait.  Beginning savory and progressing to sweet I must say things started shaky with a small plate of $4 bacon and surprisingly bland pork lost to buttery bread and cheese but progressing to \"dessert\" the story turned one-eighty, the thin pancakes fluffy and rich but brought in check by light citrus while the French Toast pulled on no reigns, a full display of decadence with supple egg bread surrounding a slathering of Speculoos and drizzled with Nutella plus a half cup of whipped cream...more than enough to share and impetus for a trip to Centennial Hills to visit Babystacks III soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pPfQ73--Y_h5Or0aqDgEGA"}

With rustic signage and large glass windows looking into the open kitchen there is not a shred of evidence that this is a \"celebrity chef\" restaurant and, really, if one didn't know any better they could walk right by without paying the space a second thought.\n\nWith the time just before 2:00pm and lunch hours till 3:00 I walked through the doors to find the interior largely similar to the outdoors and with the kitchen behind a small bar to the right and three other couples seated amidst the ~40 unmatched chairs and old wooden tables to the left the feeling was instantly anything but that of another Arizona shopping center. Working on a small crew of three during the late lunch hours I stood for a moment at the hostess stand before being greeted by the Chef who introduced himself as Rob and suggested I take any seat I like, eventually settling on a cozy two-top beneath one of the ceiling fans as the room was a bit warmer than I'd prefer.  Settled in and with my books in hand it would not be long before I was greeted by Hillary, the sole server for the afternoon, who presented the 13-item menu.\n\nWith a vibe that speaks to a sleepy Italian villa from the shabby chic seating to paintings straight out of the hands of Italian street artists I spent a few moments perusing the menu before Hillary returned and with iced water in hand and the chef agreeable to my gnocchi request it would not be long before a plate of Pane Bianco Bread with Olive Oil would arrive from the kitchen and after a short conversation with my server about what I was reading I turned my attention to the crusty yeasted roll that, while good on its own, was vastly improved by ample use of the grassy and slightly fruited oil.\n\nMoving next to my special request, I really did not know what to expect from the preparation as it was simply listed as \"Potato Gnocchi with Arizona Sweet Corn and Zoe's Pancetta\" but seeing as how I love all three ingredients I figured it would be good no matter what; little did I know that it would be the best gnocchi I've had in my life.  Beginning first with the potato dumplings, each of the little balls was hand cut, light as a cloud, and literally melt in the mouth tender even after a quick sear in the pan but moving past the obvious pasta skills of the restaurant what truly put this dish over the top was the ragu-a sort of half roasted corn kernel/half creamed corn imbued with cream and smoky notes from the pork amalgam absolutely teaming with both sweet and savory notes. So simple, so rustic, and yet so perfect I simply cannot say enough about this dish-the one that finally unseeded Marc Vetri's 2 year stranglehold on the best version of my very favorite pasta.\n\nAs I swooned over each bite of the gnocchi Hillary kept my water filled and stopped by repeatedly to check in and find out when I was ready for my sandwich and although I was sad to see the gnocchi go I was happy to see the \"House-Made Mozzarella with Prosciutto Di Parma\" sandwich arrive in the same vivid glory as the one from a month prior at Pane.  Again focused on bucolic simplicity and flawless ingredients it would be hard to find fault in this sandwich or its accompanying fennel and lettuce salad in a light vinaigrette but as good as the Prosciutto was I couldn't help but think I liked the tomato slightly better...though I bet a version with all three would be stunning.\n\nAt this point quite full and with dinner plans that would turn out to be quite extensive Hillary stopped by and boxing up half of my sandwich asked if I'd like dessert-a suggestion I nearly declined until her smiling description of the Asian Pear Crostata sold me that it was something I should probably just go with - and go with it I did, a bargain basement $5 for superlative poached pear served over a rustic butter pastry and topped with vanilla infused cream. Light, delicate, and much like the pasta and the sandwich a perfect evidence of what one should expect from all of Bianco's restaurants-perfect ingredients largely unmanipulated and prepared just enough to extract maximal flavor.  \n\nA charming space with lovely service and food that speaks to everything I love about Italian it would be hard for me to find a single bad thing to say about Italian Restaurant and with an offer to stay and study as long as I liked the only thing that kept me from lingering at 4743 N 20th St was the fact that it was a little too warm for such a full stomach-it made me feel like I needed a nap; yet another sign of a very successful meal.

Billed as a space for \"Fun Italian Dining\" with a take-out station to the left and bar-full of craft brews tucked behind it was just moments before 7:00pm that I took my seat and with the majority of diners tourists with small children the scene was decidedly rambunctious, a duo of servers including the young woman in charge of my table clearly struggling to keep pace with large orders despite efficient back-servers helping to bus tables and refill water.  Unapologetically overpriced like the majority of Strip-side dining it was only after a few questions regarding the possibility of a half-and-half pizza (no for specialties, okay if you build-your-own) plus  a description of the daily specials that I eventually placed an overzealous order and with an appetizer slice of foldable New York style thin-crust quickly arriving from the exterior facing window my first taste was quite favorable, the gentle crunch and pliable crumb on par with that at Pop-Up or Secret beneath a subtly sweet sauce and bubbling fresh mozzarella.  Moving next to mundane garlic bread that no Italian mother would likely lay claim to it was fast on the thick loaf's heels that my gourmet pizza would arrive and with ample toppings showing a keen eye for balance over the nearly cracker thin crust the meal was soon back on good footing, the punchy sour cream a particularly inspired pairing to mellow the marinated artichokes and herbal topnotes from the pesto and fresh basil.  At this point just shy of my gift-certificate minimum I was left with a decision between the restaurant's signature chocolate cake, a glorified brownie sundae, or balls of fried dough and opting for the later with a sidecar of caramel I'm confident to say I made the right choice - each of the seven cue-ball sized doughnuts perfectly crisp and virtually oiless beneath a hefty shake of cinnamon sugar as the duo of sauces jockeyed for position on the tongue's already overcrowded sweetness receptors.\n\nDramatically overpriced without the benefit of a 2/3 discount but featuring a more than competent slice along with the best Zeppoli I've yet to find in Las Vegas there are certainly worse options for quick casual dining on the strip and although neither service nor setting are likely to win any awards I'd happily come back to explore more of the menu if armed with another coupon, a distinct likelihood considering the general dearth of quality on restaurant.com ever since the rest of Mandalay Bay pulled out several months ago.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yxxLFua918P53BQADGCSCw"}

Located on Sunset with clever signage and clean d\u00e9cor it was to an admittedly amusing display that I entered the small store and left with plenty of time to peruse the options as an elderly couple attempted to speak English to a store clerk lacking knowledge of even the difference between 'yes' and 'no' I took a simple point-and-nod approach, my three item order tallying just $3.47 as I sat to dine-in.  Admittedly a skeptic based on an already diminished selection as early as 9:00am it was with a small fritter that my sampling began and as the lone one remaining my early suspicions were quickly confirmed, the doughy disc either a day-old or the result of a base entirely lacking anything but flour.  Discarding the fritter after only one bite it was onto the old fashioned that I moved and although a step in the right direction the results were not much better - a bit of tang amidst a decent crumb beneath a sugary glaze flecked with dark bits of unidentifiable taste.  Last, and thankfully not least, a basic blueberry cake donut was clearly artificially flavored but at least offering some semblance of freshness it was the only option of which I ate more than a bit, the server staring blankly from behind a small television as I discarded the rest and made my way to the street.\n\nFailing at even the most basic task of serving fresh donuts while presenting the sort of language barrier I'd assumed only present by crossing a border I cannot fathom why anyone would visit KDs except out of convenience, and even then I'd much rather spend the money on gas than suffer such a lackluster experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zAWZw3tks3eod85vWrWLQg"}

Nicely flavored with what seemed to be vanilla tinged cinnamon sugar perhaps I just got a bad selection, particularly as the hole was much better.  Waiting for a while to tackle the brownie (after lunch, to be exact,) it would prove to be far more successful than the donut and having the option to select a corner piece I was particularly impressed by the heft of the cocoa notes and how the use of fruit helped to sweeten the brownie without making it overly sweet.  Clearly the result of quality ingredients and rustic as can be I will say that if you can resist temptation long enough to get it home a quick second in the microwave to enjoy it warm really helps as the melting pockets of chocolate juxtaposed against date, nut, and cake were lovely.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3yNs4HBBk7kIDFBa3G9BrA"}

At $2.25 for a cup that is literally bottomless I could see this being dangerous if I went on a day when I was with my books to read.\n\nBlueberry Cornmeal Hotcakes:  At $10.95 this is the menu item I would have ordered during my visit to the original had the Chocolate Chip Pumpkin French toast not been a chalkboard special and true to the rumors the hotcakes did not disappoint.  Golden and crisp on the exterior with a slight bit of grit to the interior crumb each of the three cakes was packed with bursting blueberries and slightly buttery even without the addition of extra.  Served with a side of pure maple syrup (the sort they charge you extra for at Matt's) if there is a better pancake in the Valley I'd be surprised.\n\nCinnamon Roll French Toast with a side of Grilled Ham:  A $12.95 chalkboard special requested without the cream cheese icing my dining buddy this lovely dish featured a house made cinnamon roll cut lengthwise, then sliced vertically, and finally dredged in rich vanilla batter before a trip to the skillet.  Golden on the outside, cinnamon sugar caramelized within, and served with a bowl of fresh fruit plus natural maple syrup and grilled Niman Ranch ham I'm pretty sure it would have been better with icing, but it was pretty darn good without while the ham was rich, moist, and suitably smoky without being too saline.\n\nSouthwest Biscuits and Gravy:  A gift from the kitchen described jokingly by the owner as \"something you won't find in San Francisco\" this small sample of one of the chalkboard specials featured a rich and flaky biscuit topped with smooth gravy rife with jalapenos and red peppers plus chorizo.  Clearly not a dish terribly concerned with being subtle I really enjoyed the texture of the biscuit and although my modest Midwestern tongue needed copious water to quell the heat I actually enjoyed how the bright acidity of the peppers helped to keep the gravy from being too thick and heavy.\n\nCinnamon Roll:  At $3.50 this cinnamon roll would prove to be good, but when compared to the rest of the meal really nothing special.  Served warm with the frosting slowly cascading down the sides of the buttery bun it is not that there was anything 'wrong' with this dish - it just was not nearly as good as the French toast interpretation even though it was equally amply endowed with butter and cinnamon.\n\nBlueberry White Chocolate Streusel Muffin:  One of two daily muffins and perhaps the steal of the morning at $2.50 this dense muffin was not only large in size but huge on flavor.  Served halved and warmed with a bit of cornmeal interspersed in the otherwise rich and buttery batter the highlight of this muffin was the smoothness of the white chocolate and how it melded with the rich streusel topping to form an ample foil to the sweet and tender berries.  One of the better blueberry muffins I've had in recent memory it took restraint to not order the chocolate chip coconut variation on the muffin as well.\n\nPeach Cobbler Crumble Cake with Whipped Cream:  While I guess I could fault the service here in that they originally forgot the whipped cream I cannot and will not do so because in all reality the addition of house made whipped cream to this $5.50 slab of cake was the very definition of gilding the proverbial lily.  Beginning with a batter as light as angel food yet unmistakably imbued with plenty of butter and sweetened local peaches what truly made this cake stand out was a tan ripple I can best describe as cinnamon butter cake running from edge to edge and a lightly toasted topping equally rife with the aromatic spice and just enough sugar to caramelize.  Bite for bite this was probably my favorite dish of the morning, but showing a bit of restraint given the day of eating yet to come I was glad to let some of it go home with my friend - to call the portion 'generous' would be an understatement to say the least.\n\nThe Verdict:  Bearing in mind my obvious predilection to breakfast sweets over breakfast savories and the fact that I'd been told all the Bay Area's recipes had been ported over faithfully I had no doubts that walking into Dottie's Scottsdale that I would like the food; what surprised me most was how much I enjoyed the scene and the service - both equally well carried over from San Francisco.  Having said before that Dottie's is one of the very few breakfasts I'd actually wait an hour in line for and living in a city where it seems everyone is willing to wait hours in line for Matt's Big Breakfast I personally see Dottie's True Blue Caf\u00e9 as a sort of breakfast ideal - food good enough to wait in line for, but without the line.  I'll definitely be back - and likely at the exclusion of wasting a moment of a Bay Area vacation time or waiting in line at Matt's ever again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qKBdXH1kZNU-c9BHQaTUag"}

Dubbed by my mother as one of her happiest memories of the whole trip through Canada the St. Honore was truly a breathtaking dessert with the dough perhaps a millimeter of crunch followed by an airy interior piped with citrus and cream subsequently topped with an airy mousse of berries plus a slightly sticky glaze - \"refreshing\" is not generally how I'd describe a St. Honore, but it was quite appropriate here.  Moving next to the Brest - one of my favorite pastries, it was certainly not 'light' or 'refreshing' but the choux again was miraculous, this time with a light sugar glaze, while the interior of the lower shell was stuffed with light almond cream and the top decorated with a swirl of more dense hazelnut mousse.

Taking a break and waiting until home for the rest a chocolate chip cookie served notice to a lovely rendition of the classic with dark and milk chips aplenty while the financier, in all its density and plump berries was Parisian textbook whether labeled 'tart' or not.  Last but not least, the puck of bread pudding received gentle treatment on a cast iron pan, griddled until custard began to melt, and filling my new kitchen with wafts of cinnamon and butter it will be remembered fondly as the first thing I ever 'cooked' in my house...and far better than anything I will actually cook anytime soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OIz-ANecBe-GOZVZZUHSXA"}

Equally fond of these events (perhaps less so) than I am of chains given the inherent biases involved I will say that I waxed and waned as to whether I should attend but after e-mailing and being assured that I could write as I like, I figured why not?\n\nLocated directly across from the Biltmore Del Frisco's Grille is a swanky space befitting the upscale location and with high ceilings, an airy design giving way to a lovely patio, and an open kitchen juxtaposing a well stocked bar and walls of wine the space has all the curves and contours of a modern top end steakhouse without feeling heavy or bourgeois in the least. Light and sexy with blonde wood, black lacquer, and beige tile throughout an added bonus on this particular afternoon was the four televisions each visible from the outdoor patio, each showing a different college football game.\n\nCroque Madame: A must order when present on the menu for myself but an item previously unknown to my friend this take on the French classic featured a rather young Gruyere along with American white cheddar cheese, thin slices of jambon, and light sauce Mornay atop toasty whole grain bread. Presented alongside a light salad with a touch of vinaigrette and topped off with an over-easy egg this would prove to be the weakest of the day's six selections largely due to the mildness of the ham, crustiness of the bread, and relative lack of runniness from the yolk.\n\nSouthern Fried Chicken and Waffles: I was admittedly a bit weary of this dish since many upscale restaurants seem to be tackling this southern comfort food trend lately but after some debate between this and the benedict I think we made the right choice. Featuring a trio of mini cornmeal waffles each topped with a crisp and juicy breast of chicken plus a strip of crispy hickory smoked bacon what really set this dish apart was the crystal hot sauce spiked maple syrup. Soft and doughy meets crisp and juicy meets sweet and spicy - perhaps it wasn't as 'down home' as Lo-Lo's or as refined as Bouchon but either way it was really good.\n\nBanana and Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast: If a picture says a thousand words then I simply suggest you look at the image above-from the caramelized bananas to caramelized crust on the custard soaked brioche this was amongst the best French toast preparations I've had in recent memory. Creamy meets crunchy and loaded with flavor even before the addition of Grand Marnier spiked maple syrup this was the dish of the afternoon without question and paired with the same thick-cut hickory-smoked bacon as the waffles the only thing that could have made this better was a tableside flaming a la bananas foster.\n\nRed Velvet Belgian Waffle: In the end these turned out to be quite good and far less predictable than I'd expected. With all things appearing in Red Velvet ever since the cupcake craze began my biggest fear was that there would be nothing \"Belgian\" about these waffles, but what arrived was actually quite impressive as the quartered waffle was slightly yeasty and plenty raised with a crisp exterior giving way to a steamy and soft interior with hints of cocoa as opposed to being over the top chocolate. Again graced with bacon and drizzled rather than slathered with whipped vanilla bean cream cheese the flavors were all nicely balanced and restrained-a very well executed dish and a great choice for those not wanting an egg dish but also not wanting something quite as sweet as the French toast.\n\nNutella Bread Pudding: With coffee, a great blend with good cocoa notes and a bit of caramel roasted specially for Del Frisco's, served I explained to our server that although I realized the complimentary dishes were limited to the brunch menu I would gladly pay the $10 for dessert as I simply couldn't justify leaving without trying the bread pudding...but in the end, no check arrived. What did arrive next, however, can only be described as everything Mike likes in one gooey pile with a crisp exterior giving way to a nearly molten center rife with buttery cubes of brioche sealed together with Nutella. While I'd be foolish to call the dish 'subtle' in any way since it is certainly not for those without a serious propensity for the hazelnut spread, the team at Del Frisco's actually did a rather impressive job in attempting to add some levity to the dish with a surprisingly light ball of nearly espresso intense house-made coffee ice cream drizzled with caramel. All in all it was my favorite dish of the afternoon and certainly on par with the bread pudding at The Mission for best in the Valley.\n\nMore in the blog...", "type": "review", "business_id": "gFJtzwGmDTABRwL2F8GsSw"}

Focusing on the food it should be noted that much of what was ordered actually came to the table exceptionally well prepared and beginning with the foie gras I was immediately impressed by the quality and presentation, a single vein the only flaw in an otherwise Robuchon-quality prep featuring a caramelized medallion alongside a semi-sweet salad plus creamy, rich croquette and moving next to crispy, complex chicken alongside the equally crisp but decidedly spicy fries it was with good fortune that the milk shake, albeit small, was present to quell the heat.  Overlooking the spongy, dense bao and tepid duck entirely lacking for crisp skin and instead assisting my mother with the lightly charred burger topped with woodsy mushrooms and aromatic marmalade it was perhaps with recollections of the zeppole at Settebello the day prior that I ordered the doughnuts and although not quite as impressive, the eggy brioche stood strong beneath a dense lacquer of sugar rounding out a fairly impressive afternoon largely warranting the $75 tab, if not a significant tip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t6SuvEq9PPVGzNv5bJzDtw"}

Having already made two breakfast stops prior and with plans for Andreoli's Christmas Festival at 2:00pm I knew I'd need to save room and as such I perused the options carefully before settling on a trio...plus one en route back to the car.\n\nStarting with the most unique, a food truck concept I certainly never saw in the Midwest and would have never expected in the desert, my first stop of the afternoon was at The Maine Lobster Lady (http://www.mainelobsterlady.com/,) a truck described as \"A Maine island girl, along with her very own lobster fishin' partner, serving the real deal Maine Lobster from the coast of Maine to the desert southwest!\" and the menu, service, and accent all hold true to that definition in every way.\n\nPriced substantially higher than the average food truck given the quality of the ingredients my selections from The Maine Lobster Lady would be two - the first her signature Maine Lobster Roll with hot buttered lobster chunks served simply on a grilled roll.  Simple, fresh, and loaded with lobster this was about as simple as it gets and although small considering the $17 price tag it would be hard to quibble this quality of crustacean nearly 3,000 miles from its point of origin as it was every bit as good as that in Boston or elsewhere (where, incidentally, Neptune charges a whopping $22 for their roll.)\n\nMoving next to a more innovative, though less impressive choice, a $9 cone of Maine Shrimp Puffs arrived as a half dozen hush-puppy sized balls of medium sized Maine shrimp tinged with butter and herbs deep fried to golden and served alongside a zippy garlic aioli.  Tender but a bit too oily for my own personal tastes and with the shrimp far less snappy than the aforementioned lobster the aioli was a welcomed boost - a shot of flavor compensating for an otherwise disappointing dish; next time I think I'd go with the Whole Belly Clams or the lobster mac n' cheese.\n\nGood, particularly given the fact that it arrived from a truck in the middle of Phoenix, but pricey at $26 for perhaps a dozen bites of food I see The Maine Lobster Lady as a well conceptualized idea to fill a void, but not someplace I'd seek out unless I really had a craving.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jKLR4wAywvVcGtQnCLzoRw"}

Great snack/bar food with a happy hour price of a mere $2.50 it would be hard for me not to order these on a return visit given my affinity for both cornbread and honey - ham included or not - but for Southern/Soul food purists it may be better to look elsewhere as the ham is definitely notable on the palate.\n\nFor the cold appetizer the $16 \"F This\" PB&J Foie Gras Torchon was one part of my original reason for visiting Praying Monk in the first place and served in a small sealed jar with a layer of whipped and compressed liver at the base topped by blackberry jam and house made peanut butter mousse I'd be hard pressed to name a better torchon or terrine under $20 outside of Paris.  Arriving as a 2oz portion of each layer alongside a small stack of toasted baguettes each aspect of the composition was nicely flavored and with the sapor of the foie balanced nicely by the unsweetened berries the peanut butter added a bit of salt and a light toasted flavor that lingered on the palate.  Having had far less successful attempts at Foie Gras with PB&J at notably more expensive restaurants I'd consider this a must order.\n\nWith the waiter, the bartender, a chef or two, and myself now being entertained by The Red Hot Chili Peppers my main course of \"Kentucky Fried Quail\" would arrive as I was slowly enjoying the foie gras and with the small bird surprisingly plump I again set aside the liver and moved onto the hot dish before me; the first bite a crackling of deep fried skin and lightly herbed breading that would set the tone for everything on the well composed plate. With small bones still present but easily navigable the quail itself was not-surprisingly lean with just enough fat to keep it juicy and with a the bird's slight gamey flavor well met by the breading even more levity and balance was found in the accoutrements - a mild lightly dressed slaw of Brussels sprots and \"Red, White, and Bleu\" potato salad featuring tender redskin potatoes, a touch of mayo, and punchy bleu cheese...unnecessarily upscale comfort food perhaps, but damned good as well.\n\nWith the hour now nearing three Spencer returned to ask if I wanted to see the dessert menu and with my mantra that it never hurts to look I said sure and received a short list of four choices, all of which sounded okay but none which sounded great, and as such I deferred to my server's opinion and he recommended the \"Fourplay\" based on his own personal preference for cheesecake, a good recommendation though certainly not on par with the savories.  Described on the menu as \"Flourless chocolate cake, New York Cheesecake, Chocolate Cream, Milk Chocolate Parfait, and a Chocolate Fan\" and mere minutes after ordering it was clear from the start that this was a pre-prepared dessert and while each texture was nice enough the cake itself was a tad spongy thus relying on the 'fan' to add a bit of crunch-rich but not heavy, cold but not frozen, the flavor itself was not all that different from a Hostess Ho-Ho...not a 'bad' thing, but at $7 perhaps the only overpriced item I ordered and an area where the Praying Monk could definitely stand to improve.\n\nWith the check settled-a veritable steal considering the gift certificate-and an ample tip added for the 1 to 1 service I sat for a few moments reading and listening to Beast of Burden before making my way to the door where the Scottsdale Sun had basted my car to a pleasant 121 degrees.  A long day of dining behind me and dinner yet to go I hope Praying Monk is turning better business on other days of the week-my guess is that it'd be an awesome place to watch some College Football in the coming months, particularly given the quality of the food (and beer list if you're into that.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "xOlzK02DWzETeZ8HbiEB0A"}

Beginning first with kitchen timing; a 25 minute delay between course 2 and 3 (from pick-up to delivery) with my waitress stopping by twice to say it would 'be right out' is poor form.  Additionally, while speaking of my waitress, considering the fact that I was obviously interested in the food it would have been nice if she acted more interested in me as a diner - instead she did not inquire even once as to how I enjoyed a dish and asking questions felt more like attempting to drag forth information while she instead spent time describing the menu at length to a needy woman who wanted all her dressing on the side and modifications to myriad dishes.  Perhaps I'm a bit presumptuous here, but if someone is there (with, or without a camera) dining solo they are clearly there because they are passionate about the food and if a server chooses to ignore that it is evidence that he or she cannot read a diner and thus should not be in that position - particularly when the other servers were engaging their tables between each course and even brought the Chef out to say hello.\n\nCrispy Pig Ears - chili vinaigrette:  Setting the tempo early, this dish is all about flavor and while the texture is largely that of the crackling pork ears and chewy cartilage within the flavor is a bit sweet, a bit sour, a lot of heat and a lot of porky sapor.  Can't say I 'get' the price discrepancy (or why it is so difficult for restaurants in general to update their online menu) but this is a good choice at $5 or $7.\n\nButterfish - tomato, lardo, arugula:  Call me crazy, but I don't really get the fuss over this dish; sure the smooth texture and mild flavor of the fish are conducive to the overall flavor arc, but with the lardo shaved particularly thin and the oven-dried tomatoes quite intense there simply was not much here that could not have been achieved with a bit of salt and fresh sliced tomato; the flavor something akin to a bland BLT and the arugula not particularly notable at all.\n\nGrilled Mozzarella - tomato, grilled date, basil:  For my money the best savory course of the night - a strong compliment considering the fact that a lot of the food was quite good - this was simple and intense, each ingredient packing serious flavor and all brought into harmony by the smoky warm mozzarella.  Served with olive oil brushed grilled bread I'll note here that if you desire more than a single skimpy slice (with this, or with any other course) you should ask well in advance, and if you have my server ask twice as it is likely to be forgot.\n\nMushroom - mozzarella, truffle, egg:  I love eggs, but the overcooked white and half-set yolk in this dish really added nothing to the earthy amalgam of mushrooms and mozzarella.  Texturally accented by toasted brioche and meeting with a hefty drizzle of truffle oil (I do not believe any actual truffle was harmed in the making of this dish) this was without a doubt the most texturally interesting savory of the evening and although I only received another slice of bread after the remaining juices had turned cool I still wiped this one clean before sending it back to the kitchen.\n\nRisotto - Squid Ink, Chili, Tuna, Tomato:  Apparently a bit of a signature dish at Crudo (and the only one my server would offer an opinion on aside from 'everything is really good') I must say that although I've had better risotto in terms of texture, the balance of flavors here was really something else - a subtle sweetness from the tomatoes melding beautifully with light heat from the chilis and the confit tuna' bold flavor standing up admirably in the face of the slightly gummy rice.\n\nPorkbelly - smoked tomato agrodolce:  Fatty and funky with crackly skin resting atop toothsome and creamy polenta this was pork belly as it should be and showing a deft hand with tomatoes for the fourth of my five prix-fixe courses the smoked reduction here cut the fat perfectly - simply a great dish and a surprisingly large portion.\n\nApple Frangipane Tarte:  Outsourcing their desserts to Tracy Dempsey Originals I knew the quality here would be high and with a boring sounding panna cotta vs. a potted Tiramisu that looked quite good as my other options the tarte was a clear winner - the crust a dense shortbread and the filling a rich but light almond paste with caramel roasted apples topped off with a bit of whipped cream.  While I personally think any self-respecting restaurant of this caliber should be making their desserts in house it would be hard to quibble with choosing Ms. Dempsey who is now 4 for 4 in my book.\n\nGood - but I'm not rushing back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xk3inJcuBGLhavUcdlINZA"}

Clearly a spot where the impressive beer list supersedes the quality of the food our meal started off on the wrong foot when we were denied seating in the main dining room and placed in a smaller back bar area and although the bartender was pleasant enough while a great soundtrack played overhead it became quite obvious early on that our lack of enthusiasm for suds was unappreciated with food arriving slowly, often far from hot while water refills required direct inquiry.\n\nFocusing on the food, a first round of appetizers proved to be fine, if not wowing - the pretzel nothing to write home about and the \"do you want cheese with that\" commanding an unannounced $3 up charge while the dates and pecorino were a nice sweet and savory pairing with quality ingredients well prepared.

Having already enjoyed breakfast at eat. but with plans to spend the rest of the day off strip our stop was somewhat impromptu but arriving just after 10:00am the shelves were still packed and with a latte for my friend we decided to sample a few items, some enjoyed in the shop and some saved for later with only a rubbery (and quite honestly quite unpleasant) s'mores bar and a bit too much frosting (an obvious decorative necessity) on the cupcake marring the experience.\n\nSpeaking to the items that shined it should first be noted that the service at Chocolate and Spice is exquisite - a smiling staff of young women working the counter and delivering each individually plated item to tables - and given Megan's background in cake design the bouche noel and body of the cupcake were both dense, moist, and aromatic - definitely a place worth ordering a cake for a special event or a special person.  Moving on past the cakes, Ms. Romano's scones are much like those served at Keller's Bouchon - a bit softer than the standard with a crunchy sugar coating and pockets of butter juxtaposing plump, bursting fruit - while the Banana Cream Pie, without a doubt the show stealer of the afternoon took 'flaky crust' to a whole new level and married it to bananas, banana pudding, and plenty of light pastry cream with a drizzle of caramel that rivaled Tartine, Susina, and Dahlia Bakery for 'best ever' bragging rights.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JmUf7RUDjFc7PhCAMSHSuw"}

Best described as cozy without being cramped and featuring portions far larger than one would expect given the price-point or quality of cuisine it was with a giant jar of potted rabbit that our meal began and immediately struck by the rodent's nutty sapor my expectations for the rest of the cuisine rose substantially, a follow-up plate of crispy fries topped with squeaky curds and a sizable slice of seared liver further upping the ante without a bit of sogginess to be found.  To this point unexposed to the restaurant's signature ingredient but soon to be treated to a plethora of pork it was next a small pocket of yolky ravioli that arrived and with flavors harkening breakfast I was again left smiling, a follow-up of terrine-topped choux draped in briny pork fat and reined in by balsamic perhaps the best plate of the night.  Stumbling next with overcooked octopus and guinea fowl that got lost in everything else on the plate it was unsurprisingly with pork that Chef Bonanno righted the ship and although seemingly a bit aggressive given accoutrements of peppers and Calabrian sausage the flavor was actually quite restrained, a light bit of smoke set against creamy potatoes and ample aromatics arriving from the porchetta itself.  Unfortunately not currently serving their oft-raved bread pudding it was finally in a quartet of donuts that our meal would end and with rich chocolate poured over each bite as light notes of citrus occasionally peaked through I was admittedly glad when my tablemates stated they were too full for more than one, the last golden orb gobbled up with glee before the modest bill was paid.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eG3Kxpv-JOLib9o5W9Aiyw"}

Unfortunately beginning the night on a sour note, literally, as lemon ruined an otherwise delicious sounding egg cream it was with the beverage stricken from the bill and replaced by cold brew that the meal was reset and although perhaps a bizarre 'pairing' for charcuterie I'm happy to say the bitter contrasts surprisingly worked - a board of boldly spiced goat sausage first perfuming my palate with smoky notes only to be followed by tender poultry imbued with earthy aromatics and extremely subtle brine.  Realizing coffee would overwhelm my main course and thus cleansing my palate with pickles plus tiny olives that packed some seriously salinity it was onward to a vegetarian-friendly bowl of pasta that my meal progressed and with hues of purple, orange, and green in full effect the flavor was even more impressive than the visual display - each tender noodle rife with natural sweetness while butter-roasted Purple Knights and decisive pesto melded into a nutty, rich sauce.  At this point unable - or at least unwilling - to eschew dessert it was between a plate of cookies or a housemade sundae that I was left to decide and deferring to my waitress as to which she preferred I opted for the later, fond childhood memories of the movie-snack \"Whopper\" brought forth with every bite.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UIjO8lq1Lh0H2l9VfIfifQ"}

Greeted next by our server, a delightful young woman named Hedda, and then by the restaurant's manager it was explained to us that the method of operation was to grab a menu and then order at the counter while coffee is done self-serve and with that in mind we perused the menu and the restaurant's interior before making our selections.\n\nWith the space largely empty at such an early hour (but later to fill to capacity as I sat studying till 9:30) we both admired the cozy industrial/shabby chic interior and with The Shins and Minus the Bear amongst the morning soundtrack the restaurant was lively but not loud, though a small group on the outdoor patio seemed to be having quite a good (boisterous) time.  Chatting as we waited it would not be long before the food arrived and purported to have overordered I personally thought everything looked just right when our table was filled - particularly as I sipped on my third cup of the Vovomeena's bold and intensely earthy brew.\n\nTaking notes from various culinary traditions including the Deep South, England, Ireland, Portugal, and more our meal started with a simple buttermilk biscuit topped with salted butter and paired with a side of strawberry rhubarb jam.  With a light crisp to the exterior while the interior crumb was moist and rife with lightly sour notes I partook in the top half of the biscuit while my friend enjoyed the bottom and although good on its own the addition of the jam was definitely more my style.\n\nMoving next to the one dish I'd probably not have ordered if I were visiting on my own, the \"Banging Pocket\" with Shreiner's Banger, Scrambled eggs, and smoked gouda wrapped in a pita was actually quite good, though largely due to the use of quality ingredients more than anything particularly done with them as the pocket of pillowy bread featured a nice balance of fluffy eggs, spicy sausage, and just enough cheese to make it 'stick.'  Neglecting the \"griddled spuds\" on the side largely because I found them a bit too greasy I will note they were quite tender and well complimented by the salt, pepper, and onions.\n\nNoting my propensity for sweet over savory at breakfast it was not until Hedda described the \"Boxty\" that we decided to order it and while it too was just a bit greasy the overall effect of the hot and crisp potatoes juxtaposed against the sour shredded apple and creamy but sweet mascarpone was quite nice.  A sort of sweet meets savory hash brown served with choice of meat I personally would have preferred to see the bacon, also Schreiner's, more thoroughly cooked but that is just a matter of personal preference as the quality of the meat was quite impressive either way.\n\nFor the next choice - the most expensive on the menu with good reason - the B.M.O.C. would prove every bit as good as its description would have you to believe.  Beginning at its base with a crispy waffle lightly tinged with vanilla notes and plenty of butter then subsequently topped with apples cooked down in maple syrup, a smoked pork chop, two poached eggs, and finally a crunchy Portuguese donut it would be hard to call this plate anything but gluttonous...or delicious.  In a dish where any number of elements could have shined, what truly set this dish apart for me was actually the chop - a smoky and savory slab of meat that was easily cut with a butter knife and fork and nicely matched by the intense sweetness of the rest of the plate.  Better than the famous \"chop and chick\" at Matt's and less expensive (without the line) this will, and should, become the restaurant's signature in my opinion.\n\nMoving last to the \"dessert for breakfast\" item that had originally drawn me into Vovomeena the day the menu was first published, the pain perdu was simply exceptional.  Featuring dense banana bread rendered into a custard style bread pudding and subsequently sliced to be fried up on the grill this was everything I want from bread pudding - crisp and caramelized on the exterior, soft and dense within, and topped with bold \"whiskey caramel\" sauce plus ripe bananas that push the dish ever-so-close to \"too sweet\" while still keeping things in check, particularly when matched with the Schriener's Sausage.  At $6.95 you'd be hard pressed to find a better breakfast dish in town and having sampled my fair share of bread puddings I'd put this iteration in my top ten.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vl4-5il_LGtDRxUCy9ldw"}

A cute space, open at 10:00am with a small but well culled collection of American classics plus a quartet of French macarons at prices far less affronting than those on-strip and in Summerlin it was Tiffany herself both baking and running the register during my visit and inquiring as to what she would recommend, in addition to my standard Red Velvet cupcake, a quintet of items was selected and at a total charge of $10.88 - the price/quality ratio without a doubt skewed to the right in terms of what followed, particularly the rich, moist cupcakes with thick yet subtle frosting and the dense brownie - also moist but anything but subtle with rich cocoa tones beneath a shellac of pure peanut butter.  Admittedly preferring my macarons of the crisp, light variety popularized by Herme or Laduree it was perhaps a matter of personal taste that I found the shell of each cookie a bit harder than I'd have liked but with an excellent break quickly melting away to smooth flavors it was the fillings that truly shined, the butter cream especially impressive and the sort of thing I could definitely see highlighting one of the bakery's custom cakes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "k0EfcQdHrgGuW-4DVR8XVQ"}

High points below:\n\nChicken Liver Pate with Poached Cherries and Tuscan Toast: To anyone who knows me this was an obvious choice and served in a flip top jar for $7 along with a pile of lightly oiled toast it was every bit as good as I would have hoped.  Dense and slightly rougher cut than a true mousse but rife with a mineral tinge below the liver's characteristic sapor the cherries served as a brilliant foil to the fat and easily enough for two this would have been the deal of the menu if not for the daily special.\n\nFocaccia di recco - ligurian style baked focaccia with fresh soft cow cheese and local honeycomb:  Perhaps the most consistently raved dish from both the Chicago location and from local gourmands who'd already visited Davanti Scottsdale the first time I'd heard of this dish was actually from our server at Avec and although slightly different in texture and composition this Ligurian classic marrying crisp focaccia with a stracchino/mascarpone blend was every bit as memorable.  Taking an alternate route to Avec's density and utilizing local honeycomb (an extra $2) as opposed to savory notes to balance the soft cheese's higher lactic acid content I'd be hard pressed to say who does it better, but at $18 I can only say this dish is worth the money even if it seems 'simple.'\n\nRoasted corn + walnuts + pecorino + arugula + wild mushrooms:  Wanting to sample from each part of the menu this choice from the insalate was recommended by our server and although I would have preferred to taste it warm (simply too many items on the table at once) it was quite good at room temperature as well.  Essentially the results of high quality ingredients paired carefully this was a dish about texture and flavor above anything else and with the mushrooms and corn each lightly cooked there was a great interplay of natural sweetness and earth all set off by the lightly applied cheese.\n\nTruffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus:  I'll start out by saying it wasn't as good as the incredible famous version at 'ino...but it was pretty damned close.  Oddly a fan of eggs at all other meals despite my propensity for sweets at breakfast this \"toad in a hole\" style presentation featured nothing more than a dense piece of brioche topped with a thick slice of young fontina lightly kissed with truffle oil and black pepper plus julienned asparagus on the plate beneath; it was simple, it was rich, and it was the one dish I really wished would have arrived separated from the others so I could truly enjoy it as opposed gulping down my half for fear of it getting cold or soggy.\n\nChef's Whim - Confit Roasted Half Duck + Sour Cherry + Mascarpone Polenta + Candied Pecans + Radish + Endive:  I'd wanted to try a pizza, but when our server told us the Saturday \"Chef's whim\" I fortunately changed my mind - and I say thankfully not only because duck is my favorite protein, but because this was one of the best duck preparations I have ever tasted.  Priced at a bargain $20 and featuring a half-duck split down the center served over a bed of mascarpone polenta and Amarena cherries whose texture would rival the finest gelato this was the sort of rustic preparation I'd hoped for walking in the door.  Intense and meaty with crispy skin giving way to tender flesh each bite of this dish was savored as much as the last and with sweetness from the cherries and pecans met by the bitters of the radish and endive the dish never felt 'heavy' at all.  Honest to God, ff this is on the menu it is a must order - I've paid twice as much for far less impressive fowl at any number of 'top tier' restaurants.\n\nChocolate Budino -Chocolate Pudding + Amaretto Cookie + Toasted Marshmallow:  Un-wowed by the standard dessert menu and myself with dinner plans three hours later we'd originally considered skipping dessert until our server told us the \"Chef's Whim\" dessert of the day was a budino - on par with bread pudding for 'must order' status for myself - and with a dense pudding of semi-sweet chocolate at its base subsequently topped with a warm amaretto cookie plus light meringue quickly toasted under the salamander this dish also wowed.  Thankfully small in portion but huge in flavor I'd place this dish among the must orders.\n\nThe Verdict:  Service and music issues aside, Davanti Enoteca is a great addition to the local dining scene and although much of the menu is cribbed directly from West Taylor St. the dishes where DeRuvo was allowed to flex his muscles were without a doubt the strongest of the afternoon.  Perhaps the gnocchi did not live up to expectations and would have been better sold as a gnochetti and maybe some would argue that the focaccia is a bit overpriced priced at $18 but all things being equal my friend and I walked out the door for $60/pp after tax and a more than generous tip for a meal featuring 7 good-to-great dishes, particularly a duck dish I'd put on the same level with versions at Gagnaire, Eleven Madison Park, and L'Arpege.", "type": "review", "business_id": "U97cOaXPSOGmVhKEomPjlg"}

Generally not one to go straight for the \"Benny\" but more than willing to trust the chef's instinct I will simply say that while I probably would not have ordered this if left to my own devices it actually turned out to be my favorite dish of the morning - a deft blend of vegetal flavors augmented by the creamy egg and savory pork - and as I mentioned to Ms. DiNardo when she stopped by my only \"complaint\" was that it did not come with more bread (or a spoon) to wipe up every drop of the first Hollandaise I've ever tasted that truly made me say 'wow,' an effect largely attributed to an unexpected lightness imparted by the tomato.\n\nAnother new feature of the brunch menu entitled Pumpkin Ricotta Pancakes with Pecans and Syrup would arrive at my table next and served in a \"tasting\" portion the single flapjack was lovely in texture but unfortunately somewhat light in pumpkin flavor until I added spread the honey-kissed butter and added the warm syrup, the sweetness serving to bring not only the vegetal notes to the fore, but also light saline notes and a bit of spice that I still cannot determine whether was in the cake itself or the syrup.\n\nNext up, a large pile of warm and toasty bread arrived alongside the vasi of Ricotta and Local Honeycomb.  Simple in preparation and flawless in execution there really isn't much that needs to be said here - if you like ricotta and you like honey this dish, much like the chicken liver from the previous visit, is a $7 steal and a little goes a long way - IE, it is probably best shared.\n\nSpeaking of things that are best shared, the pastries at Davanti are listed as $2 each and instead of asking about them I simply suggested they send me out one of each - a sizeable order to say the least with five different selections coming out along with salted honey butter and grape jam.  Apparently a concept set to evolve and changed each week with new options to come and go the day's selection for Sunday featured a warm cinnamon roll, fig and walnut muffin, honey sour cream muffin, cinnamon sugar donut, and chocolate marcona almond donut topped with cream cheese frosting.  Impressive in size and also in quality I personally felt both cake donuts were excellent as the lightly fried exterior gave way to a soft central crumb and although the frosting on the chocolate one could have been too heavy for some it actually worked very well given the heft of the cocoa.  Moving on to the rolls and muffins, the cinnamon roll was certainly the weak link of the board as it was simply too dense - as though not given enough time to leaven - while the muffins were both superb, the honey sour cream version almost a savory that went perfectly with the jam and the fig and walnut muffin a spongy cake that reminded me of a fig newton without all the unnecessary sugar.\n\nAt this point quite sated but not overly \"full,\" I spent the better part of ninety minutes reading and listening to tunes while my cup of Lavazza received consistent attention from the staff and as the end of brunch service approached I was asked if I'd like anything else thus sparking a brief internal debate that ended with me ordering the Purple Pig Panini.  Paying homage to the Chicago Wine and Charcuterie staple while riffing it's most famous dessert what arrived next was far larger than I'd have guessed from the $7 pricetag but featuring that same fantastic house made bread this time wrapped around Marshmallow fluff (also made in house,) Nutella, and sliced bananas I knew that even as my server suggested he'd never seen anyone finish it that I'd be just fine...with those ingredients on that bread there's simply no way this dish wasn't going to be good.\n\nGo.

Moving next to things more substantial it was admittedly with some disappointment that neither the $11 French Toast nor the $21 'worth the wait' fried chicken proved nearly as memorable as their respective milk jam or biscuit plate-mates, but with the former too bready and the later far from crispy there are simply better versions to be found elsewhere, particularly at such a cost.  At this point sated but certainly not full, the kitchen would quickly rally back with a duo of desserts and while the piping hot monkey bread certainly deserves the attention it has garnered it was the caramel-corn studded budino that stole the show for me, a dense pudding both salty and sweet with crunch and cream taken perfectly with another cup of coffee as Chris Cornell crooned overhead.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cwAd2nytPLKmABtLXsgpIw"}

Grand in both scope and spectacle with ornate glass, open floorplans, and plush seating complimented by a staff of over twelve-dozen overseeing preparation, service, and customer needs my arrival at Bacchanal shortly preceded its 8am opening and greeted first by a cheerful cashier, then by assistant manager Stephanie, my experience commenced; the subsequent three hours adrift in 70+ of the buffet's offerings and a sea of smiles emanating from each employee and nearly every patron.  Divided into several sections with many offering cooked-to-order options including crepes and omelets it was Asian that my meal began and with fresh steamer baskets just opened the dim sum excelled - a small quibble in the thick-skinned har gow more than compensated by bao, duck and pork as good as that at Jasmine plus full-service congee complete with century egg, not to mention Sin City's best Egg Custard Tart later discovered at the dessert island.  Moving next to things more \"American,\" one is well advised to monitor for items fresh from the kitchen as both the crunchy waffles and well seasoned chicken proved superlative while later tastes of waffle fries and tots fell flat - a fresh buttermilk biscuit, hot seafood preparations, and sliced meats including smoky beef ribs with caramelized crunch all showing far better.  At times a touch liberal in salt with Kung Pao Chicken and Risotto suffering the most, Bacchanal again shines in selections of shellfish, cheese, and charcuterie but with much eating to do and such things widely available elsewhere it was thoroughly in my sweet tooth that I indulged and although I passed up a few cookies plus a duo of sorbet suffice it to say that I nearly ran the gamut; cakes, doughnuts, pies, tarts, and more all justifying the calories with the aforementioned egg custard, pecan pie, cream puff, carrot cake, and citrus 'tiramisu' all warranting special mention along with the lovely pastry team who jovially tended to baking, saucing, arranging, and making crepes at a pace seldom to lull.\n\nSlightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan's soundtrack I'd be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.  Obviously limited by the constraints intrinsic to feeding anywhere from 2500 to 4500 persons in a given day yet defying the odds through a combination of remarkable customer service and striking attention to detail I'm happy to say that Bacchanal lives up to the liberally applied superlatives and although \"Gods\" may require something slightly more refined I'm almost positive they won't find it in such a format for less than $50, especially on Las Vegas Boulevard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g"}

This place has potential, but thus far that potential is not fully realized.\n\nseven plates, four desserts...and a $1 'bread supplement'\n\n\"Shrimp and Grits,\" a savory and intense composition of sweet and snappy head-on shrimp atop creamy popcorn grits enlivened by charred onions and smoky pork glaze with a touch on honey.  Sweet and savory but perhaps a bit steep at $14 this was a dish where the ingredients and the execution came together beautifully.\n\n\"Arizona Ricotta, Sicilian Pistachio Toast, Roasted Radish\" at $8 arrived as a trio with only a single flaw - a dearth of salt to liven up the otherwise beautifully cooked radish.  A bit of a disappointment even despite the high quality of the tender taproot the dish certainly improved in moving on to the bread crisps as the ricotta was ever so slightly melted while the bread itself was herbal and crunchy but at the same time subtle.  With a bit more salt this one could be great.\n\nFor Duck Confit Meatballs, Foie Gras, White Bean, Tomato Agrodolce it would be hard to say exactly how/why such decadent ingredients did not live up to my expectations, particularly as the meatballs were tender and rife with flavor, but if I had to pin it on one thing I think it would be the expectations arising with the word \"Foie Gras\" and the $14 price tag as the sapor of the foie was largely lost to the tomatoes while the puree of white bean was okay, but mostly just filler.\n\nBerkshire Pork Belly, Kimchee, Udon Noodle, Fried Egg arrived with some joking at the table about the ubiquity of pork belly these days and as much as I cannot argue that said ingredient is delicious I just didn't find it well utilized here as the fattiness of the swine simply overwhelmed any semblance of kimchee while the noodles were soggy and limp.  Decent flavors though garnished by a rather inconsequential egg I had a few bites and that was enough.\n\n\"Maine Lobster Fried Rice, Mullet Egg, Aji Amarillo\" was actually a rather nice plate of risotto with a lot of umami and a touch of heat but \"fried rice\" it most certainly was not.  Nice enough, but certainly not a sharable plate, one of my tablemates summed it up perfectly when he commented that all this dish really did was make him want to go elsewhere and get a dish of \"kick ass\" fried rice - something he could have done at 1/3 the tab and had enough for lunch the next day.\n\nMoving last to a pair of sides, each $6 and far more generous than the rice, Grilled and Buttered Shiitake Mushrooms, Truffle Honey along with Grilled Broccoli Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg, Black Pepper arrived and where the first showed strongly in its simplicity the second fell flat once again due to a lack of salt - a lack so pronounced that frozen broccoli straight from the bag has more flavor thus making me wonder exactly what sort of pancetta was even present.\n\nButtermilk Blackberry Crumb Cake arrived as a dense butter cake with a downhome toothsomeness that I really enjoyed, but with ample notes of buttermilk dominating the sweetness of the berries I think this one could have benefitted from one of two things - a dollop of ice cream or a cup of coffee.  I'd definitely order this as a breakfast item anywhere.\n\nCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  A long and linear presentation with the apple flavor a bit overwhelmed by the salty caramel but still potent and tart what truly made this plate shine was the ice cream - creamy, rich, and rife with nutty flavor...had we been dining earlier I'd have probably driven over to Sweet Republic for another round.\n\nUnder other circumstances Sacher Torte would have been the highlight of the meal and served with \"Toasted Almond Amaretto Mascarpone Mousse\" this one was a fine example.  Dense, intensely cocoa, and appropriately dry without suffering the Americanization of making it too birthday-cake in texture this was another dessert that would have gone great with coffee but the use of the mousse and bold apricot flavor kept everything balanced and bright.  It was awesome.\n\nIf there is one thing The House should keep doing from this point until the day they close their doors it should be keeping the Butterscotch Pudding on the menu.  A fan of all puddings - from rice to bread to budino - and having had a number of similar presentations elsewhere this version was simply outstanding - sweet and salty, dense and creamy, and bespeckled with chocolate and fruit adding both texture and flavor.  It goes on the short list for Phoenix's best desserts and will likely remain there for some time.\n\nOverall, The House is off to a decent start but still has a lot of room for growth in every department except perhaps dessert and d\u00e9cor.  A lovely setting already with great service I think the focus should start with improved seasoning and working to nail the basics before experimenting with 'fusion' and once the kitchen is hitting on all cylinders perhaps improving the portion/price ratio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eXaVJc5GMIjYEUjbrc13FA"}

Small and neat, a simple pastry case and a crepe stone at the front of the restaurant with the kitchen in back and a few stools and chairs for dining in it was just after 10:15 when I arrived at Suzuya and with a couple picking up a custom cake while another woman, clearly a regular, stopped in for two-dozen apple pies I spent some time chatting with the employees about what was best, eventually allowing them to talk me into a crepe to go with a quartet from the case.  Clearly focused on fusion but well-versed in French techniques my tasting of Suzuya started with a pair of crisp and buttery choux puffs filled with traditional Japanese accoutrements and although I'd have personally preferred the squash to be more sweetened the red bean version was exquisite and the pasty textbook, a trend that would continue onward to the buttery lattice of the subtly sweet apple pie and a crisp mille feuille filled to order and garnished with Chantilly cream and fresh fruit - both every bit on par with versions from b.patisserie during my June visit to the Bay and as such amongst the best I've experienced stateside.  Clearly not leaving without at least doing due diligence to the crepe it can only be said that as far as crepes go this was about as good as it gets, the batter light and airy with a silken mouthfeel just robust enough to hold up to the equally light ingredients and a veritable deal at $4.75 which will see me back sooner rather than later to enjoy the mille-crepe cake or whatever Chef Misuzu and Plourde think of next.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DqJij-nTV3yvmJqfd8KAOQ"}

Faring better, both in terms of ingredients and texture, I will admit that the Casanova was a good pizza with great chew and top quality ingredients, but for two pizzas on the exact same day to be so wildly inconsistent certainly gives me pause when considering a recommendation of Federal Pizza, let alone a return visit...not in a city where far better pizza can be found in abundance.\n\nA nice space for drinks, appetizers, and even desserts perhaps I'll give Federal Pizza a second chance at some point, but with Pizzeria Bianco, 'Pomo, The Parlor, and La Grande Orange all turning out a superior product there is no chance I'd wait in line to do so.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m9haUi2_1lHR2eAKBhKwDg"}

the sort of place easily overlooked or dismissed as a 'chain' in reality using top-tier ingredients to please everyone from families to aficionados while embracing a culture of learning and evolution, no one style of pizza considered to be the only 'right' way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wYuPafwLYItJAHFVba9mVg"}

Moving on to more novel options, it was with personal interest and love for mille feuille that I ordered Manan's \"crispy version\" and with crisp layers divided by light cream before being rolled in fluffy icing and crunchy coconut-tinged flakes the Napoleon was not a bit soggy, just light, lovely, and perhaps the best non-traditional version I've experienced to date; an impetus for a later return to check out the 'standard' version which I'd venture to be equally delicious, particularly with seasonal fruits incorporated in the cream.  Focusing last on the two \"must try\" items suggested by my server, it was with the bird milk roll that I began and although good I personally found the cake to be a bit dry, my tastes instead trending toward the appropriately named \"dream cake\" whose Napoleon like crunchy layers of graham were divided by a lacquer of thick, nutty milk-jam while buttery crumble and light pastry cream added just enough levity to reign in the intense sweetness - a perfect complement to a good cup of coffee later that evening and something I'll absolutely return for soon, along with the Gata, Yojik, Manan Cake, Kartoshka, and Mikado...maybe the Smiling Cake, Nutella Napoleon, and Fruit Cookies as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iwFGxwkDJQhPSI1Cj24QYQ"}

Apparently part of some recent food-television contest, at least according to the only other diners present during the first half of my hour-long stay, and featuring the sort of service where patrons are frequently referred to a 'buddy' or 'bro,' it was just a few minutes prior to noon that I entered the sizable strip-mall space and seating myself after grabbing a menu it would not be long before 'crack corn' and water arrived - the former a relatively straightforward salty-sweet combo with that wasn't particularly addictive, though a bit more interesting than boring bread-service to be sure.  Clearly a kitchen where tongue-in-cheek and whimsy are part of the show it was in a duo of vegetables that my meal began and although the Peas and Carrots was decidedly delicious with plenty of vegetal sweetness amidst the crisp wontons, the \"beeten apple\" was mostly forgettable - a stacked pseudo-bruschetta compromised by lifeless bread with honey and apple mostly overwhelming both cheese and thinly cut beets.   Moving next to options from the pork and chicken parts of the menu it was the Monte Cristo that arrived first and griddled rather than fried the sandwich was far lighter than usual, a fact furthered by far too little filling to go with just a drizzle of jam.  Moving next to a clever presentation of Chicken and Waffles that proved to be the best savory of the meal as both the waffle and chicken showed well, it was here that my server inexplicably tried to end the afternoon by offering the check and acting as if I'd eaten 'a lot' despite each plates' modest portions I assured him I would like to go on - a duo of desserts again representing a hit-and-miss proposition as the enormous Chinese-donut-come-churro was excellent on its own - and even moreso when crumbled into the ice cream - while S'mores were poorly executed with marshmallows not warmed through and the chocolate a dense chunk inside the oily outer shell.\n\nProbably a space better suited for large-group sharing, particularly if paired with enough drinking to make the 'funzies' seem more fantastic, Nosh & Swig almost seems to be trying to out-Fieri the Mayor of Flavortown himself - a half-hearted attempt that seemed to fall on deaf ears when I mentioned the flaws in execution on both the 'bruschetta' and the S'mores - the later actually garnering a \"yeah yeah, I can see that, bro\" when I pointed out what seemed to be a half-dissolved Hershey Kiss inside the remaining wonton I sent back to the kitchen untouched.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wL-h9AXEEMlc8A1Alo9vhg"}

Located in the corner of a space best defined as 'questionable' and more appropriately 'seedy' I was admittedly impressed at how separated Fat Choy seemed from the casino and how well the smoke from the slots was excluded from the dining experience and after getting past these issues I was even happier to find the service aspects of the restaurant far better than the typical \"Chinese restaurant\" and actually on par with many high end places on the strip.  With a small crowd of varying ages and ethnicities I made a simple inquiry about the shrimp toast (not typically on the brunch menu) and was assured the chef would be happy to prepare it and although each dish I ordered was good the funky sausage juxtaposing shrimp and tinged with spicy mayo all melded together with a fried egg was undoubtedly the 'must try' dish of the meal.  Opting next for a crunchy waffle topped with somewhat mundane chicken and a bit of Sriracha spiked syrup alongside the signature Duck Bao - a great rendition with pillowy bread, crisp skin, and snappy pickles all playing for center stage - I think it is safe to say that sticking with less \"American\" food is in one's best interest, though the fusion focused crisp roti topped nutella, rich mascarpone, smoky walnuts, and ample honey makes me think that perhaps something like a Korean style chicken and waffles could be just the right thing to add to the menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}

Located in a typical strip mall on West Flamingo and featuring a concept self described as 'Japanese tapas' the evening began with the simple decision of bar versus table and opting for the later amidst a warm yet stark interior it was to the tune of a shared $95 omakase plus several supplements that the meal unfolded - an invigorating paco-jet concentrated cucumber amuse setting the stage for what would follow.  Beginning first with a trio of fried happy hour bar-snacks from which the 'best' would be impossible to select and then transitioning into several amply portioned plates both cold and hot it was early on that a consistent pattern of superlative proteins over bright citrus and subtle aromatics emerged, the Suika Saka and Sakana Yaki particularly enthralling while the slightly overcooked Niku Berry's beef proved that a m\u00e9lange of mushrooms can truly save a plate, particularly served point/counterpoint with tart early-season strawberries.  Rounding out savories with the crunchy Age Maki, an inspired take on Mexican Street corn dressed with briny uni, plus a $9 bite of slightly overseared foie gras cribbed direct from Austin it was at long last that we transitioned to sweets, a trio ordered but four delivered and all amongst the best I've experienced from Eastern influenced cuisine - the mango 'yolk' of the panna cotta and banana pudding-come-cr\u00e8me brulee Kanmi-O both on par with the pastry at Robuchon or Twist at half the price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HpaYCM_NCauI72LLXxC6SA"}

Small in size but diverse in selections with steamer tables, chilled sections, prep-to-order, and a whole room of desserts it was with Asian options that I began and with sliced to order Peking Duck on warm bao the star of the show both dim sum and crab soup would show equally well while congee proved mealy and flavorless leading me to overlook the noodle station in favor of things more unique.  Focused next on cold tables it was in exotic ingredients and iced shellfish that Jasmine hoped to justify its pricetag and although the King Crab was fine while foie gras pastry proved addicting the sushi, cheeses, charcuterie, and salads were rather pedestrian - a toothsome muesli better fitting as dessert a rare exception to the rule.  Moving through more \"American\" selections including a decadent pot pie, two delicious benedicts, and casserole-style French Toast imbued with banana and Nutella while quickly discarding flaccid waffles and dried out breakfast breads it was finally in sweets that nearly everything excelled - a well culled selection from which I nearly sampled the gamut - a Jean Phillipe's gelato station, perfect puffs of choux, and DIY fondue all receiving repeat visits with Asian pastries decidedly conspicuous in their absence.  Undoubtedly a special space but maligned by service faux-pas necessitating requests for refills plus clean utensils suffice it to say that although 'luxe' in many ways a brunch at Jasmine does not come cheap and while some items shined none but the duck was on par with Wing-Lei's Chinese New Year while neither service nor selection were equal to Wicked Spoon which rings in at nearly half the price after tax, tip, and drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uCZe5GLqTeadjTLlvWNF4w"}

Virginia - the legal marriage between a cookie and a brownie\nThe Banana Flax Cake\n\nLocated within the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada, a space more commonly referred to simply as \"The Center,\" Bronze Caf\u00e9 had long been on my list of places to visit and seeking coffee plus free WiFi near downtown on Saturday I finally decided to drop in, the smiling staff greeting me warmly as I entered while several patrons sat throughout the atrium using a bank of supplied computers or looking through literature supplied in a small library toward the back of the room.\n\nAdmittedly located in a rough part of Las Vegas, the surrounding environs largely comprised of rundown housing with no shortage of panhandlers to be found on the streets, the interior of The Center seems to act as a sort of sanctuary to those in the community and with free services available ranging from HIV-testing to prevention and sex education the environment is both open and inviting, the electronic music overhead perhaps a bit of a distracter but certainly not so loud that it cannot be ignored.\n\nOffering a selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, baked goods, and smoothies running the gamut from mundane to esoteric with options for vegetarians, vegans, and those dining gluten free in addition to several options featuring meat, it was entirely in the pastries that my investigation of the caf\u00e9's goods was undertaken and treated to a vegan smoothie shot as I waited for coffee to be brewed I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised, the apple and banana with light vanilla doing an admirable job of offsetting the bitterness oft associated with the greens.\n\nSipping the espresso over ice, a bold brew with a nutty finish at less than half what one would pay for Starbucks on the Strip, it was with seven items plus a gifted Fruity Pebbles Treat from owner David Mozes that the tasting took place and beginning the rainbow treat a theme of strong flavors and excellent textures quickly arose, any 'artificalness' associated with the commercial cereal completely lacking in a vegan strawberry cookie with a jam center that ranks amongst the best in the city with a pudding smooth mouthfeel and light creamy top-notes.\n\nTrying best to progress light-to-rich it was next in the slightly dry oatmeal cookie that I partook and setting this aside in favor of hopefully better things a bite of the bacon-jam scone proved to be far softer than one might expect from the British tea-time staple, though the savory jam and ample use of butter was none-the-less quite delicious beneath a light sprinkling of sugar with subtle sweetness dispersed beneath.\n\nEntirely impressed by the peanut butter riff on a Snickerdoodle with ample cinnamon and sugar helping to mellow the otherwise rich base it was with equal balance that fruits and vegetables interacted to create the ultra-moist chocolate zucchini bread with the sort of richness that spoke to high quality cocoa, the similarly soft banana-flax cake perhaps a better choice for those desiring something more subtle with a light nuttiness from the fractured seeds coming through on the finish but not a bit of oil or bitterness to be found.\n\nAt this point seeing the soundtrack transition to upbeat Spanish dance music as a large group of teens plus a young family with grandparents in-tow sat down to breakfast it was finally in \"The Loving v. Virginia\" that I indulged and having previously tasted no fewer than a dozen takes on the cookie-meets-brownie including Brooklyn's famous \"Brookie\" from Baked I'm confident to say that the version at Bronze Caf\u00e9 may be the very best of them all - the chocolate base reminiscing of my childhood afternoon snack while the dollop of dough at the center was just seconds short of fully set, the whole far greater than the sum of its parts and something probably best shared, or at least enjoyed with a cup of coffee, milk...or in the case of Bronze Caf\u00e9, perhaps some almond mylk. \n\nSetting aside a location that some may find a bit intimidating for any number of personal misperceptions, Bronze Caf\u00e9 is the sort of place that is likely to go overlooked by all but those who walk through the doors of The Center, but with strong sourcing, friendly service, and a menu as inclusive as the building in which it is housed it can only be said that there is a whole lot more here than meets the eye, and a whole lot of things to tantalize the tastebuds as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nw8lWJRGybAsciao9h-R2Q"}

Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and d\u00e9cor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux-taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found.  Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'\n\nNot exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each.", "type": "review", "business_id": "itFwrNtjrQL5NPMYTeD44g"}

A large space with brick walls, wooden floors, and unfinished ceilings plus plenty of space to spread out and enjoy a pastry and coffee or a full breakfast it would not be long before I arrived at the pastry case and after sampling pieces of both the White Chocolate Pistachio cookie and \"Lulu's Signature\" cookie I placed my order for five items, each boxed or bagged individually, and made my way to the car.  Saving much of the sampling until later in the day but beginning with the Nutella Croissant as it was the only item still warm from the oven I was quite impressed by the quality of the laminated pastry as a shattering exterior gave way to a wispy open crumb that held up to being split and lacquered with a layer of hazelnut-chocolate cream admirably though an almond croissant sampled later on was less impressive, the exterior still crisp but the interior slightly 'bready, though thankfully not overdone with frangipane and actually quite subtle, which I enjoyed.  Moving on to the sweeter selections, the oatmeal cookie proved competent though nothing to write home about while the cupcakes each featured a nearly angel-food texture, the cannoli version not terribly interesting once past the interesting frosting and embedded cookie but the peanut butter and jelly quite excellent with fresh preserves and chunky nut butter piped deep into the cake's core.", "type": "review", "business_id": "21ZKuOC0o8vZglDeR41QLQ"}

Featuring a menu heavy in reinterpreted bar foods, enough televisions to watch every game on NFL Sunday Ticket simultaneously (apparently part of the future plan,) and a soundtrack with a little too much Journey and KISS for my tastes the decision was made largely to stick with items recommended by the staff and not particularly a beer aficionado I opted for one of their 'limited edition' Aviation's as well - a truly excellent cocktail liberally spruced up with cr\u00e8me de violette.  Speaking to the quality of the food I found much of what I ate at Pub 1842 to be quite good - the pretzels soft and salty with a poached egg gilding the proverbial lilly along with the beer cheese while the reinterpreted deviled eggs were also excellent.  Less impressive, both the spring rolls and the mushrooms came off far too oily and while the duck paire with mint and cilantro was at the very least tasty the mushrooms were actually rather terrible and flavorless, a fact I mentioned to my server with the item subsequently stricken from the bill.  In traditional Mina fashion dessert proved a strong finale to the meal, in this case featuring a \"buckle\" that ate more like a souffl\u00e9 pairing sweet peaches and a caramel shake with boozy toffee sauce, a great variance of texture, temperature, and flavor that I'd gladly return for along with a cocktail and a few non-fried snacks during Saturday or Sunday football.", "type": "review", "business_id": "riTkPznlAPl86dazAjPO3A"}

Ever service oriented and eager to please even as I snapped a few photos before tasting the goods it was first in the lightly sugared option that I indulged and featuring delicate laminated pastry beneath a light exterior crunch without a hint of oiliness this is as close to the 'original' as I've found, a supple interior chew harkening a simple butter croissant but unmistakably a donut as well - an effect replicated in the rich chocolate option, though with far more 'mess' as the heated ganache slowly dripped through the donut's hole with each bite through innumerable golden layers.  Admittedly still a fan of the slightly more nuanced, crisp, and less sugary \"O-Nut\" at DK in Santa Monica or that found locally at Coco, for those looking for an Ansel-esque croissant-donut without the airfare and 2+ hour line it is hard to argue against either \"America\" at New York-New York or Press, though with similar pricing the latter proves far more appealing to those adverse to navigating construction or a smoky casino floor.\n\nFor now I'll score this place 4 stars given the limited pastry menu, but dinner may change that soon if the small plates and desserts menu proves equally impressive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "shKCOCGEQctC7N4AvP3nWw"}

Large in size and seemingly crafted from an old barn with comfortable communal seating amidst the glow of two-dozen televisions and gentle fluorescent lights it was mere moments after entrance that we were greeted by our young waitress and although not much help on the enormous beer list her service proved competent, each of six plates and six beers brought with good pacing and wide-smiles as water glasses continually brimmed full.  Unable to speak to the beer flight but impressed by the $12 tab it was with bar-food-staple soft pretzels alongside squeaky curds that we began and with both golden bites proving plenty salty it was the sauces that served as game-changers -  the funky bleu, beer cheese, and queso all remarkable.  Moving next to things more substantial it was to a truly cheesy trio that we were next treated and although the pizza could have tolerated a few more minutes in the oven to firm up the crust I was more than impressed by the ingredient quality across the board - bright Romas and fresh basil on the pie while crisp bacon and snappy apples graced the toasty sandwich, a skillet of tender macaroni under a blend of cream, cheese, and breadcrumbs rounding out the troika.  Never one to end a good meal without something sweet it was last but not least that we rounded out the evening with a steamy skillet cookie riddled with chocolate chips and eating more as a pudding than a cookie beneath Blue Bell Vanilla as Gaborik ended the game I couldn't help but smile...they just don't do sports bars like this back in Ohio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hAgtic2abji61215w8_OVw"}

Self described as \"Steampunk\" with clever details such as a wall of poisons and potions juxtaposing dark woods, gears, and gloss as an alt-indie soundtrack played overhead it was just minutes after our 7:00pm reservation that we arrived at the shopping center space and quickly led to a table at the back it would not be long before the first of two servers arrived, the duo sharing a penchant for eavesdropping and interruption with shaky pacing and presentations equally prevalent throughout the night.  Obviously targeting a younger demographic than Moonen's stronghold of sustainable seafood downstairs it was in no shortage of creative cocktails to pair with the menu's imaginative bites that our decision process progressed and with friends browsing the Ipad for a quartet of $15 drinks while I curated the course of cuisine the meal that followed could best be described as \"clever\" - the drinks trending towards sweet while plates overall proved tasty despite being overcomplicated without any true benefit from the excess technique.  Starting with a trio of sharables before progressing to things more substantial it was with disappointing cured meats alongside the restaurant's pot pie nuggets and signature bacon n' eggs that our dining began and although both of the later would prove amusing, if not particularly great, the stars of the show would only arrive next - the rings of squid tender with a tinge of acid amidst spicy meatballs while the fowl featured impeccably crisp skin over roasted, juicy flesh.  Not particularly enthralled by the selection of sweets but wanting to give the pastry kitchen a fair shake it was finally in two American classics that we partook and with the deconstructed pie entirely underwhelming while the cookies would have taken actual effort to botch the bill was simply dropped off - the first time of the evening that our server was without an offhand or clever remark, though perhaps an appropriate pairing to the decidedly dull desserts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1Zj3JOukVxyU2kq4Vhju9A"}

Featuring a slice counter plus a handful of primi, pasta, salads, and desserts alongside 16\" pizzas cooked in a 550 degree oven the \"style\" of McClain's signature pies falls somewhere between traditional New York slices and a Roman lightly-leavened 'crunchy' crust but with ingredient quality meeting the standards set by Sage the results were largely impressive save for the excessive use of oil and salt marring the Truffle and an unannounced red sauce lending a peculiar barbecue note to the North Beach.  Faring better, a simple Margherita assuredly displayed the restaurant's sourcing with tangy tomatoes and fresh basil while the Blanca shined largely to a thick dollop of house-made ricotta on each slice.  Moving past pizza, a sampling of the cannelloni proved to be my favorite savory of the day, albeit slightly overpriced at $18 for two pasta tubes stuffed with tender pork and topped with creamy Bechamel plus meager truffle shavings while a trio of arancini presented a unique riff on a classic by substituting house cured pepperoni for traditional sausage and pairing it with thick, aromatic aioli.  Never happy to leave a restaurant without dessert, a final pairing arrived at the table in the form of a small apple pie with accoutrements both sweet and savory alongside fried brioche cubes paired with sour cranberry sauce; both sweets trumping any of the savories and a saving grace at the end of a meal that fell short of high expectations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ghnQrKVEjiWZ3UE1XDzJUQ"}

Small and intimate despite the brilliant white backdrop and with excellent service that is formal yet friendly the basic format of Sweets Raku is that of a three course dessert tasting with a few supplemental savories and after ordering the Sakurambo suggested by my server the evening proceeded with the clever candy menu paired with rich raspberry sauce before proceeding to palate cleanser of light strawberry sorbet amidst refreshing mint gelatin and then a supplementary course of creamy duck liver brilliantly paired with items sweet, savory, and acidic plus buttery laminated pastry made to order in the open kitchen.   Progressing next to the main course, one of five selections on a frequently changing menu, I can only say that if a picture is worth a thousand words then the combination of presentation and flavor displayed by \"Ringo\" was exponentially greater, the candy apples hand-blown before me and piped with apple mousse resting besides a perfect apple ladder and creamy honey ice cream made in house.

Small, spotless, but now rendered less sterile by light Japanese music playing overhead it was just prior to noon that we arrived, and seated on the corner as soon as the restaurant unlocked the doors it would not be long before an order was crafted - a six-course meal plus supplements rolling out over the course of the next hundred minutes at a slow, but deliberate pace.  Beginning first with cocktails, the light sake and bubbles pairing nicely to a both creamy foie gras with laminated pastry batons and caviar that could have used a little more cr\u00e8me fraiche to balance the brine, it was largely conversation about food that passed the time between courses and with a shooter of soup and crisp salad balancing light vinaigrette with creamy potatoes both pleasant enough, our 'main courses' each impressed - for him the salmon and ikura while I opted for fatty bacon crafted of iberico belly matched to crisp potatoes inside of a crispy, hot croissant.  Transitioning from savory to sweet with mango sorbet dressed in mint jelly that unfortunately got lost in the sweetness it was onward to better things that the meal progressed and while my friend enjoyed the Mont Blanc I opted for the seasonal Stella, a star of strawberries served over an almond-soaked financier with cream melding the two into a designer 'strawberry shortcake' with texture and nuance to spare.  Wrapping up the afternoon in puffs of choux offered with options for both cream and jam it was with little hesitation that both of us selected vanilla and black currant, the shell giving way in a crisp break to just a touch of pressure and melting on the tongue leaving me to wish they offered profiteroles by the plate. \n\nA bit underwhelmed by the caviar presentation but again impressed by everything else, including a croissant and cream puffs that made me think Raku should consider a bakery style counter as its next conquest, I still contest that Sweets Raku should be a destination for everyone who loves pastry and anyone looking to impress an out of town guest - a genuinely un-Vegas experience mere miles from the strip where passion and artistry matter much more than publicist noise or the name on the door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-k_BRFRckV7XnU76G_vK1w"}

A surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the \"limited\" Margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the Cal-Italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  Moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy Quail Egg selection it was at last the \"3-course\" Romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  Moving last to a gifted half of the Farmer's Market Pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the Quail Egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate pecan turnover would prove either inspired or memorable I think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at Pizza Rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that \"everything to everyone\" and \"do one thing and do it well\" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MN0OLvP8i0SirMJ7AMuMzA"}

Assuming that perhaps laminated and/or French pastry simply isn't where Corner Cakes shines it was next with half-hearted enthusiasm that I proceeded onward to a duo of actual 'cakes' and while the individual carrot cake was actually quite decent, a dense crumb with plenty of spice to balance sweet buttercream, the red velvet cupcake managed the seemingly impossible feat of being nearly inedible, the cake itself tasteless around a nearly solid chocolate core while the chalky, chilly frosting seemed to be channeling sour cream moreso than cream cheese - the questionable freshness and half-frozen presentation making me wonder whether the cupcake was even baked on premises...and if so, when?", "type": "review", "business_id": "IgFexUz_OuQtbyQomecicA"}

Located, like many wonderful things, on Spring Mountain Road in the same complex as Kabuto, Raku, Monta, Zen, and others it was just after 5:00 when I entered the small shop and greeted by friendly servers and low prices I opted for two small \"Cool Combos\" and with the all-natural 'snow' shaved and topped I made my towards the door to indulge, the delicate ribbons slowly shifting as I walked and the first fluffy bite crossing my lips just as I stepped outside, the flavor quite subtle and decidedly improved by the accoutrements, particularly the egg pudding which I would gladly eat by the bowl topped with or without a scoop of red bean.

at a mere fraction of the cost.\n\nNow approaching its third year in business, and outlasting concepts from several more 'celebrated' chefs with nearly universal accolades arriving from locals since opening its doors, Echo & Rig pairs the all-too-common farm-to-table concept with in-house butchery in the style of a steakhouse and leveraging the later knowledge of sourcing and artisan cuts to curtail costs the restaurant happily outstrips the likes of nearby Flemming's while retaining a local sort of feel, the two-story building upscale yet extremely comfortable with a feel that is welcoming whether one is seated in a jacket inside or sporting sandals with a glass of wine in hand under misters on the second-floor patio outdoors.\n\nAdmittedly known to the restaurant as a result of reaching out to management with questions regarding the concept and thoughts pertaining to the Echo & Rig's longterm success in a complex where little else has thrived, it was on arrival that the party was escorted to a sizeable four-top at the top of the stairs and greeted by a handful of the restaurant's sizable staff the evening started out with a comprehensive rundown of the menu followed by a complimentary plate of housemade charcuterie joining warm bread and butter as cocktails were sipped and an order was put forth.\n\nServed largely by a man named Brian, first described as the restaurant's best waiter and later as a 'brand ambassador,' it was not long after ordering a first course of food that the plates began to arrive and treated to a bowl of crispy cauliflower tinged in spice along with the items that we'd ordered one would be hard pressed to name a single bite that did not shine, the signature Portobello fries probably the weakest of the items as seasoning seemed to obscure more earthy notes while both the housemade sausage and ricotta with fruit and honey were entirely irresistible, the same to be said of vegetables that were simple yet satisfying while the 'grilled cheese' was every bit the crowd pleaser that rumors would contend.\n\nAlready questioning an order that proved quite large when accounting for portion sizes and enticing presentations that made it difficult to resist finishing each plate, entrees saw four prime proteins paired to a trio of sides and although the \"Santa Maria Rub\" unfortunately served only to overwhelm one friend's tri-tip, the quality of an enormous pounded pork cutlet and both the Spencer as well as the Cap were undeniable, the sides a bit of a mixed bag with both corn and potatoes pleasant amidst their accoutrements while the Mac & Cheese featuring \"Seven Cheeses\" was nothing more than run of the mill.\n\nUnfortunately short-selling on desserts, an odd choice for a place going so far as to bake their own bread, it was in a duo of sundaes that final bites were invested and although both were well comprised of high quality ingredients one can't help but wonder how much better the experience could be with a dedicated pastry chef, or even a cheese board considering the fact that baked brie is featured amongst the side plates while candied fruits served with the ricotta were also quite good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GGyHZtnAA5LBgouB-32ARA"}

Speaking next to the food and beginning first with appetizers including a crisp, flatbread pizza with a touch of char and excellent acidity beneath the smooth mozzarella it was actually that the carbonara stole the show amongst the small plates as the tender noodles provided a toothsome backdrop to smoky smoothness while peas and pancetta added a one-two punch of sweet and savory reigning the dish back from being 'too rich' or one-dimensional in the least.  Continually tempted by the excellent focaccia it was not long after the appetizers had been cleared that main courses arrived and selecting largely based on Italian-American classics the trio that arrived along with a rich bowl of perfectly sticky polenta was anything but subtle, the enormous portions and big flavors all the result of family recipes and excellent ingredients - the Lasagna one of the best I've ever had while the chicken parm and Sunday gravy were relatively standard fare save for the gamey and supple slow cooked lamb, every bit of which was enjoyed with focaccia dipped in the sauce as the rigatoni was a bit past al dente for my tastes.  Moving last to desserts, a quartet ordered even as my fellow diners were throwing in the towel, suffice it to say that amongst my few steadfast dining rules is that I never leave a good dessert on the table...and when we walked out those plates were empty, the lightly boozy rum cake alone worth the price of entry and more than enough to get me excited for the opening of Carlo's Bakery in 2014.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y8VQQO_WkYNjSLcq6hyjPA"}

Without a doubt the most trendy doughnuttery in town it was with some restraint that I opted for a half-dozen +1 and at a $10 tally the majority of selections were saved for NFL game time snacking, the exceptions being a still-warm $2.25 take on Dominique Ansel's 'Cronut' that unfortunately proved oily, flaccid, and uninspired plus the cocoa-laden pink velvet whose hefty chocolate notes found needed levity in rich, though overly sweet, cream cheese.  Moving onward to the rest, much like other quirky \"Voodoo inspired\" shops across the country standards like the blueberry cake and buttermilk bar proved above average while novelties stole the spotlight, each filled option featuring natural ingredients and both the banana pudding and key lime gel spot-on representations of the iconic pie fillings inside a fluffy leavened pocket.  A mixed experience to be sure and a prime example of why places of its ilk rarely appeal to purists I personally look forward to seeing how the company evolves over time...hopefully a bit less cronut/bacon/cereal 'me too' in favor of more ambitious 'outside the box' thinking a la the Nutty Pig, Salted Caramel Twist, and Cream pies.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M9ielGjZ-WdNG6CQ197NGQ"}

Small and stylish with free Wi-Fi and comfortable seating plus a soundtrack that is present but not invasive it was with some irritation that, true to rumor, our arrival was originally met with the restaurant claiming to be unable to make honey toast because they were 'out of bread' while also confirming that none of the pastries were made in-house but in true service recovery mode it was then with some surprise that upon hearing about our reasons for visiting a clerk was dispatched not only to retrieve bread but also to prepare two orders of the item for free - one traditional, one with garlic, and both topped with ice cream plus honey.  Admittedly impressed by such a showing of service though still a bit mystified as to how/why they would allow this issue to be recurrent I must say that overall the latte was serviceable albeit a bit cooler than I'd prefer while both of the honey toasts were quite good, the texture every bit on par with Ichiza and better than Spot while the quality of the bread and ice cream outstripped both.  Perhaps a bit too new to judge I cannot say yet that I'd rush back to Serenade given the distance from my home but at the same time I'd also not hesitate to recommend a visit provided Ray and team straighten out the bread situation as the garlic honey toast is definitely something that needs to be experienced to be appreciated.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lcq2CBlGdnVWzTDlrBAJ7w"}

Small in size and cute in d\u00e9cor with Robert manning the griddle while his wife, Carolyn, acted as the restaurant's lone server it was from a large menu full of breakfast standards tinged in whimsy along with a few specials that we made our selections, and opting to dine in three courses while sipping hot coffee the results were mostly impressive while prices trended low.  \n\nAdmittedly lamenting the lack of sweeteners aside from Sweet-n-Low or granulated sugar to improve somewhat acrid brew our first round came as a duo and while the High Roller Tots were golden-crisp beneath a balanced blend of cheese, beef, and onion the more impressive plate was a duo of biscuits sans country gravy, a buttery base permeating the rich crumb for $1.95 - a veritable bargain in a city where good biscuits are for lack and often $2 each.\n\nProgressing to things more 'breakfasty,' our second round arrived piping hot from the griddle and although 'loaded' French Toast was underwhelming with doughy bread quickly becoming soggy from strawberry cream cheese, glaze, and Redi-whip the 'daily special' pancakes showed far better with bursting blueberries in plethora amidst airy buttermilk batter, the use of artificial syrup always a pet-peeve, though perhaps understandable at the low cost of $5.95 for a full stack. \n\nMoving last to 'dessert,' obviously a must at any breakfast, our meal concluded with vegetarian-Carolyn's deep-fried cookie dough with bacon alongside a steamy slab of pumpkin bread pudding and while the cookie dough was perhaps a bit too sweet with little added by chopped pork the bread pudding was faultless, a dense custard base with plenty of spice and enough nuance to the intensely sweet prevent it from being heavy-handed - a perfect taste of fall, no matter how 'played' the pumpkin spice trend has become.\n\nEvery bit the 'mom n' pop' operation, with daughter (and restaurant namesake) Kailyn busying herself with a computer at a table in back, Kailyn's Diner is the sort of place unlikely to attract the typical tourist but with surprisingly large menu of options running the gamut of breakfast and lunch it is also the sort of place where regulars are the rule, a good sign of consistency and customer service often lacking at any number of spots on The Strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8q957qOv1wED08Rgs0-VGg"}

Served by Scott as trendy tunes floated overhead amidst a deluge of chandeliers it was to great coffee and friendly service that we were greeted just after the restaurant's 7am opening and seated close to the bar the it was with a simple request that courses were paced out in decadent progression, none less than good and a few truly exemplary over the course of an hour with coffee never less than half-full.  Beginning with a single savory before for moving to sweets, homemade biscuits would prove fluffy yet well-buttered beneath thick spiced gravy and although perhaps an odd pairing with a slice of \"The Best\" carrot cake, I actually preferred the biscuits as the cake itself was excellent while the frosting was just a bit too sweet.  Moving next to a far better use of the carrot cake batter, cast-iron skilled pancakes with light cream cheese drizzle would prove light and every bit on par with those at MTO Caf\u00e9 while the similarly topped Red Velvet stack would prove the best I've had to date with light cocoa tones filling the a fluffy batter bronzed by the griddle.  At this point already impressed but expecting great things from what would follow given Harrington's Cr\u00e8me Brulee French toast at Central it was with a trio that the meal wrapped up and with the waffles truly harkening a crunchy yeasted cinnamon roll it was the nearly molten bread-pudding and complex, custard style French toast impressed most - the later begging for a little umbrella given its island influence and crispy coconut topping juxtaposing creamy cookie butter and bursting berries.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l9JxJdiktn57Ypx2jqRSrQ"}

Rounding out the savories with two more richly sauced proteins including snappy squid in bright curry and tender chicken with notes of cumin, paprika, and something citrus perfuming the palate it was with full stomachs that Luby compelled us to order dessert, the tiramisu made by herself that morning, and whether 'traditional' or not I'm uncertain but either way the scoop of light mascarpone and bold coffee was much like the rest of the afternoon - delicious, comfortable, and served with gracious smiles and requests to come back soon, something I've no doubt the bacalao will compel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LGOlwgFhNgVGfUEGIpY-jQ"}

Never one to skimp on experience, especially as the owner stopped by to talk shop and express her thanks for our visit, it was with beignets and bread pudding that the afternoon concluded and with the former far less dense and oily than those at Caf\u00e9 de Monde, though not quite as rich in flavor, the latter simply stole the show as rich, eggy bread melded with boozy caramel and raisins in a simple coffee cup served still-bubbling hot...homey, authentic, and in my opinion \"perfect.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "abyw7M9utpZJGo_RF0LScQ"}

Moving next to two house-made pastas from which the better would be a dispute and then onward to supple saut\u00e9ed rabbit served alongside creamy fried oysters atop an herbal cream fortified with pork it was finally with the tableside feast of chicken that our savories did culminate and although some may balk at the $98 tab it would be hard to name a better bird in all of Las Vegas, Savoy's $180 Guinea Hen or Robuchon's $250+ Pintade taken into account.  To this point all smiles it was nearly three hours after our arrival as the band riffed on Elton John that a duo of desserts was presented and although the crowned cookie jar was rather blas\u00e9 aside from the succulent macarons the much-heralded terrarium was nothing short of a masterpiece; a decadent composition of textures and temperatures with elements both savory and sweet that rivals presentations at Atelier Crenn, Red Medicine, or even Alinea for a finish with flare, an absolute must order for anyone who loves chocolate while though those looking for something more fruit driven (and truly afire) might be wise to consider one of the tableside flamb\u00e9es...something I surely won't pass up as I plan a return visit before year's end.\n\nBalancing a high price point with exemplary ingredient sourcing and service that stands far ahead of its competition Rose. Rabbit. Lie. may be the most underrated restaurant on Las Vegas Boulevard today and although the sound level often proves far too loud for casual conversation the show itself actually proves quite entertaining, as well.  Still up in the air in the post-Nocturne era with a lawsuit hanging in the balance one can only hope that when the dust settles Rose. Rabbit. Lie. will continue to thrive and even if the concept should rebrand or shutter that the culinary team will be kept intact - a meal in the library perhaps the best-of-both-worlds for those seeking truly innovative cuisine in space that seems miles from any casino floor but not yet willing to invest in a night at Pierre Gagnaire's Twist or e by Jose Andres.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lfmvmL6iHq9-IDABLeNsuw"}

Truly a \"slice shop\" featuring a small counter with standing room only dining both inside and out plus a half-dozen pies served by a staff of four including two servers, a cashier, and a pizzaiolo hand-tossing gargantuan crusts it was to warm smiles and pleasantries that I was greeted and taking my time to peruse the options and inquire what was most fresh an order was placed - a seemingly steep $6.76 after tax, but on closer inspection a price well justified by a baseball sized garlic knot and locally sourced heirloom tomatoes on what I'd argue to be the city's best electric (or gas for that matter) crust, though purists may beg to differ given a lack of \"foldability\"...or perhaps \"fold-necessity\" as relates to greasy, flavorless 'tradition.'  Subtle with semolina but largely a lightly yeasted flour base with just enough spring and char to support the ingredient weight from rim to a center approximately one foot away suffice it to say that single slices at Pin Up will eat like a meal to some, but with dollops of fresh mozzarella playing against fresh sliced tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil on such an impressive backbone with only pre-filled $3 cannolis for dessert I'd say that's just fine...besides, knowing what I know now I rather wish I'd have stuck around to try a slice of the housemade pepperoni with shredded fresh mozzarella and hand crushed tomato sauce instead of schlepping to MGM for dessert anyhow.", "type": "review", "business_id": "x42C5j84k0Y4H20fcJwbRQ"}

Featuring an eclectic menu ranging from $3-$9 with a dozen unique base-sandwiches and options for breads, add-ons, and \"Monte Cristo\" treatment providing ample room for customization it was after perhaps ten minutes of chatting with Jake about the metal-kiosk's surprising sourcing program (think foie from Artisanal Foods made into terrine by Goodwich staff, or house-made mostarda and spreads) that I placed my order and subsequently taking a seat in raucous Dino's where TV On The Radio and The NHL Network kept me entertained it would be just over 10 minutes before my food arrived, each option truly stunning despite a sub-$20 tab.

Clearly unable to resist dessert in such a setting, particularly when featuring golden bread and Nutella for $3.50 (the 50 cent upcharge for a visit to the fryer), it was with the sweet but subtle \"Fluff & Nutt\" that my meal concluded and as the soundtrack overhead shifted to Janis Joplin's 'Mercedes Benz,' subsequently joined by nearly every voice in the house, I couldn't help but smile and think about the early days of Cleveland's now-legendary Melt, a business and sourcing model not dissimilar to what The Goodwich is targeting, and one that has now spawned three additional locations.

Over 80,000 square feet and opening nearly 20 minutes late as staff scrambled and soundcheck overran it must be said that the new Linq locale is beautiful, the dining area, stage, and lanes all up a gleaming escalator and with clever bowling-hip d\u00e9cor used to divide but not occlude each area from the next both the energy and the volume were high, even with the lanes not opened for \"unexpected\" reasons.  Settling into our seats, five of us in total, and provided the Blue Ribbon crafted menu service was decidedly rough around the edges - dishes misdescribed, crib notes clearly used, tickets incorrect, and delays plus dropped plates common - but with grace and humor plus a good environment most was forgivable...at least for now.  Moving on to food and beverage, a total of four beers and two milkshakes complimented six plates plus two desserts and with the Bourbon Street Shake and Cookie Dough disguised as French Toast \"bread pudding\" shining brightly amongst the sweets it was the savories that all wowed; 'bar' or 'bowling-alley' food only in spirit.  Beginning first with toasty pizzas featuring immaculate produce over thick toasted bread and moving on to smoked chicken wings so moist as to fall off the bone without a hint of grease it was what followed that most diners will come for, and with good reason.  Considered by some to be the \"best\" fried chicken they've ever tasted an 8 piece mixed plate was ordered and delivered alongside breadcrumb crusted macaroni that could certainly generate similar praise the matzo-crusted, brined bird truly was remarkable - just enough spice and salinity in the golden coat plus a chicharone-esque crunch to each bite bringing the quality of the moist bird to the fore. Already running an impressive kitchen in a venue primed to make a big impact in the local music scene it should only be assumed that service and timing will improve and while the 'best' debates will surely continue I know for a fact this was not my last visit to Brooklyn Bowl - gutter-balls and Black Label Society followed by a Banana Split and Molten Chocolate Brownie anyone?", "type": "review", "business_id": "4ntvolhaYeSCbHY1dhA53A"}

Beginning first with three Buldogi classics, two all-beef hotdogs and one order of fries, it should go without saying that both the franks and the house-made toppings were excellent and although fries proved a bit limp the combination of garlic and pork proved surprisingly light, the later gracing the briny Gang-nam for a smoky sapor that I only wish would have been present in the watery ham atop the underwhelming, bready, and overcooked Monte Cristo that arrived alongside an equally doughy waffle thankfully rescued by reference standard Korean Fried Chicken, crispy and lacquered with briny soy-caramel - by far the best bite of the afternoon and the best Korean Fried Chicken I've found in town.  Obviously a work in progress and still looking to find its footing amongst the staunch competition of Spring Mountain suffice it to say that sticking to the classics is a safe bet at Buldogi caf\u00e9 while wandering to more Americanized novelties is a risk; one Milner and team might better approach by being as creative as they are with the dogs - the pork belly and a quick trip to the deep fryer could do wonders for that sandwich.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aplrc7fN1tCcBUo8Vt_1zQ"}

Beginning with appetizers, expectedly suffering from on-strip pricing much like the pies, a trio of plates arrived after rather forgettable breadsticks and with the meatballs and whole-milk mozzarella ham sandwiches both pleasant enough only the eggplant really shined; the breading harkening panko and the meaty vegetable supple without being oily in the least.  Focusing next on Pizza, one white and two red, a quick look at the crust shows a good char begetting a crisp chew to mixed flours imbued with either semolina or corn, and moving on to ingredients both meats and cheeses shined - a truffled addition to the Carbonara adding great depth to a pie that easily stole the show from overly sugared San Marzanos hampering the simple Margherita and spicy Calabrese.  Passing on desserts based on a complete lack of creativity and the presence of Sprinkles next door it was to the tune of $125 after taxes and tip that we settled the tab and while I'm rarely one to quibble prices suffice it to say there are better pizzas and superior red sauce Italian values to be found throughout the Valley...even on strip I can name at least five.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r69rxmc9pdU4AnZkBhTNLA"}

Great food at a great price, smiley service that never leaves the diner for want, and a menu that executes the basics with ease while offering diners any number of ways to customize to tastes - that's a breakfast worth going out for any day of the week, not to mention the free Wi-Fi and the fact that they were playing Pearl Jam and Soundgarden while I dined.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UEyXv6C3CyxVYmxRDWYgUQ"}

Starting off with a cookie sandwich, crafted carefully with intense caramel ice cream flecked with crunchy salt between two subtly spiced cookies, and then moving to the stunning peanut butter/pretzel amalgam plus a slightly oversalted chocolate chip it was with an early sugar buzz that attention next turned to Sprinkles' mainstays; each of the $4.25 cupcakes featuring a moist yet light base with subtlety serving to balance intense frostings - the triple cinnamon particularly impressive even if it was the Red Velvet that spawned an empire.

Every bit the lively scene one would expect of a 'tatted-up' venue spilling from indoors to out yet far less loud than many thanks to high ceilings, reclaimed woods, and plenty of glass it was with the first of several cups of Stumptown Coffee in hand that our morning began and with The Doors alternating to country tunes and 70s hits overhead it would not be long before our savory course arrived, each plate well-crafted with subtle nuances to be discovered amidst decidedly conspicuous portions as the biscuit proved amongst the best in Vegas while the chili walked a fine line between heat and sweet, the white cheddar lending a sharp salinity at the top of each bite.  Always a sucker for sweets it was onward to the griddle that our meal progressed and again investing in a duo I was immediately impressed by the toothsome cornmeal pancakes enveloping a core of butter cookies and fresh fruit only to then be let down by the French Toast that was simply too 'wet' with custard to stand up to the heavily sugared bacon and sugar-torched fruit, the amalgam altogether too sweet and in need of some sort of textural variance - perhaps something along the lines of a trip to the deep-fryer in order to crisp the bread as was done in the case of a 'Monte Cristo' more than happy to eschew any fa\u00e7ade of healthiness as smoky marshmallow fluff encased in golden brioche found balance in cinnamon spread and rich chocolate, the housemade raspberry preserves a nod to the classic adding a fruity finish that lingered long on the palate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ateowLnq6kpgNNWHzCDByQ"}

Owned by Matthias Merges and nothing short of stellar in its Avondale location where service, sourcing, and skills befitting his Michelin starred past found new footing in reinterpreted yakitori, a visit to Yusho at the Monte Carlo begins with the space, a jazzed up version of the original with a long floorplan plus eye-popping colors juxtaposing the gleaming open kitchen and with knowledgeable servers brought in from icons like Savoy and Robuchon without any pomp or pretense the 'experience' unfolds like few others - casually refined and a whole lot of fun, the kitchen and front of house doing each other justice even on day one.  Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZOcfu9B5657he_gBXVeIcQ"}

Located on West Russell in one of Spring Valley's several strip malls and officially open 8a-4p seven days a week my arrival at Bachi HLK was greeted by the smell of fresh oranges being squeezed at the room-length open bar and soon finding smiling service from a young man named Brent I was offered my choice of seats - an exquisite experience amongst elegant blonde woods and an open floor plan marred only by slightly-too-loud pop music during my hour long solo visit.   Featuring all all-day menu spanning appetizers and eggs to griddles, sandwiches, and salads it was to a veritable who's who of personal favorites that I found myself tempted and opting for a trio even at the early hour of 8am the meal started with a bang, a creamy 2.5oz torchon of foie gras every bit on par with that at Bouchon but with better bread and house-made jam for $5 less.  Already smiling as I tended to my liver it was at my request that the next plate was fired in the open kitchen and arriving with cheese still bulbbling the HLK take on a Monte Cristo was truly divine as briny bird with a hint of smoke found new light in aged gruyere while supple griddled brioche dusted with powdered sugar provided an eggy canvas for thick jam, some already onboard and more on the side.  At this point sated but curiosity not yet satisfied it was with a bit of indecision that I sorted between pancakes, beignets, banana bread, and chicken on waffles but going with my instincts the final plate of the morning would prove the bet of the trio; a six stack of almond-coated custard rounds rousing the flavors of a pina colada only to be bolstered by a trio of all-natural syrups plus whipped cream and salted butter; the comparison again to Thomas Keller's work on-strip with the \"bread pudding style\", but Bachi's more subtle and texturally appealing - a strong bit of praise considering the accolades and Michelin Stars garnered by the former.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F2aOcE-K4nsc1GUToPM1jQ"}

Silky in texture and close to gelato in heft with large single-scoops starting at $4 it was eventually on the horchata-esque rice pudding that I settled and served in a fresh baked compressed-cookie bowl without accoutrements I can confidently say Art of Flavors finally has some creamy frozen competition - a bit of oneupsmanship from the newcomer, even, in the form of two warm cookies on par with the best of Las Vegas Boulevard.  Similarly priced to AoF as well as Sprinkles with a patio adjacent to the new Sambalatte one can only hope that BLVD spurs the same sort of creativity and competition in frozen treats that Due Forni and Settebello brought to reinvent the Las Vegas pizza scene over the last ten years because in a city of two-million with triple digit temperatures and tons of tourists there is a whole lot of space between Monte Carlo and Chef Desyree's spot up north for something cold and creamy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CcINGw816eHHGryatYCkZA"}

Obviously not the sort of place looking to reinvent the wheel, but rather a locals-only kind of spot where nearly all the patrons present during my early morning meal were 'regulars,' it was with nothing but smiles that I was greeted at the hostess podium at 6:45 and offered a seat at the kitchen-side bar or a table I opted for the later, a small two-top amidst spacious confines already loaded with condiments, menus, and utensils as College Gameday played on televisions all around.  Never shy to over-order, even as my waitress informed me that two entrees was \"a lot,\" it was mere moments after seating that I made my selections and starting with two doughy, $3.49 biscuits finding slight salvation in butter plus honey I quickly realized I should have again ordered the signature banana bread, though things would soon improve, my BOGO coupon yielding a duo of plates nearly overwhelming my small table.  Beginning first with another item dubbed 'signature,' the stuffed French Toast is offered with an option for bacon, sausage, or ham and doing my best to recreate the Monte Cristo the results were admirable - the fluffy eggs loaded with cheddar and chopped pork beneath slices of vanilla scented, golden bread ready to be gilded with syrup or jam.  Moving next to an item from the seasonal menu, a $9.75 three-stack of pancakes was next in line and topping the fluffy discs with pure-maple syrup brought from home plus a few pats of butter I'll be honest when I say these could just be the best buttermilk flapjacks in town, each bite surprisingly light with ample buttermilk tones punctuated by pockets of melting brown sugar and rich caramel with toasty walnuts through and through.\n\nFar larger and brighter than the original Egg & I location with similar smiling service and a 6am opening every day of the week Egg Works Summerlin is a great addition to the neighborhood and with coupons frequently offered in the local mailers serves as a great place for families to enjoy a good breakfast without breaking the bank or succumbing to big chains like Denny's or IHOP.

Every bit the bustling space suggested by its name, with close set tables and traditional heavy woods beneath the sexy glow of globed lighting, it was just after 6:30pm on Saturday when our party was seated and starting off with a stunning riff on the Bee's Knees our menu was confirmed...at least conceptually...though much of what followed was not exactly what was requested and much of it was marred by still-green service.  Setting aside small mistakes on sourcing and pronunciation as well as beverages spilled more than once plus an obvious miscommunication from front of house to back about the menu requested it was with a duo of Boulud's superlative terrines that we began and with the foie gras smooth as silk while the chicken and pork pate upped the ante with an earthy funk one can only hope for this program to expands; a \"Bar Boulud\" charcuterie program like that in Manhattan's theater district seemingly a perfect choice on The Strip.  Moving next to outsourced bread and salty butter before progressing into the one-two punch of garlicky snails followed by the best scallops I've had in recent memory as the restaurant filled to perhaps 80% capacity it was in our fourth course that things got interesting; the lightly seared lamb and its spicy sausage tender and delicious but served as our \"main course\" when my request had clearly delineated the duck as a 'must.'  Eventually served the confit after much hemming-and-hawing including the involvement of the Dining Room Manager suffice it to say that the crispy-skinned fowl is absolutely worth visiting (and perhaps fighting) for and finishing the evening with a glut of sweets plus a quintet of award-winning cheeses one can only hope the service can soon keep up with the kitchen...not only does Chef Middleton's cuisine warrant it, but so does the textbook Gateau Basque.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KcWUgvyl64Vp0PfwQRZQkw"}

though the special coffee menu did have to be requested while refills of the houseblend drip were infrequent to come around.\n\nInexplicably targeting every writer in town at once, a PR move I'll never comprehend as a steady stream of positivity would seem far more beneficial than an obvious en masse lovefest, it was nonetheless in in three courses that our 130-minute stay would take place, some dishes far better than anticipated while a few were no better than those found Off-Strip for less than half the cost.\n\nBeginning with a pastry basket offered as part of the prix-fixe, for our purposes self-selected but usually Chef's choice, only the Monkey Bread was particularly memorable as both cornmeal-based options were far too dry, and moving on to appetizers suffice it to say that aside from stingy portions none of the Antipasti \"platter\" showed as well as it sounded, the better bites found in a la carte options including the moist chicken meatballs awash in spices and a duo of cheeses that were well aged and portioned to fit the double-digit pricetag, the accoutrements and crisp lavash also faring well.\n\nAcknowledging the import status of their Artisan meats, but hardly ever to pass up Mortadella whenever it is found, it was an intermezzo \"pizza\" that would be far better described as a flatbread which seperated appetizers from entrees and with a pleasantly pliable crust and a good sapor to the meat the quality was just fine aside from the $15 tab, particularly compared to dreadful gnocchi that may as well have come from a box, the bowl going unfinished despite being no more than four spoonfuls of limp noodles laid in a watery and insipid sauce.\n\nTurning next to entrees, a porcelain crock featuring layers of eggplant and noodles separated by spicy sausage undoubtedly a highlight of the meal, those interested in tasting Giada's signature cacciatore without going all-in at dinner have their chance to sample alongside crispy polenta waffles - recommendations to combine sauce, bird, and syrup not worth the time or effort as separating the plate as two-halves is far more successful, though neither is likely to make anyone say \"wow.\"\n\nFinishing up with dessert, the options scaled down from dinner and lacking in seemingly obvious bombolini for reasons unknown, the go-to dish is undoubtedly a pudding-soft citrus souffle served with buttermilk gelato while the leaning tower is no more than a Cold Stone quality ice cream cake, an \"inverted cappuccino\" entitled Cappugiro from the specialty coffee menu a far more intriguing proposition and the sort of thing for which I could almost justify a return visit, if only to sit at the bar sipping while enjoying the view.\n\n**Told by some that Giada has improved since opening while others suggest they have locked in their core clientele and no longer need to try, I'm sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle, an experience worth having once if only to say \"been there, done that\" but not the sort of place warranting return visits for those who truly care about value or great food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "s5-VDvUqyYnD8RG3LPqnbQ"}

Beginning with the tried and true in the form of a mixed box of donuts both classics and fancy I was immediately impressed by quality of the crumb in old fashioned while the fritter proved far less greasy than I remember from the spot on Harmon, a plethora of apples folded into the crispy, cinnamon-laced dough.  Moving on to things more novel it was not long before my breakfast sandwich arrived and offered at a mere $3.99 with two sugared kronut holes plus hash browns the ham, egg, and cheese were relatively standard fare propped up by a now-softened kronut and although the concoction arrived a touch soggy after a trip to the microwave it still proved a pleasant foil to the intense sweetness of a quintet of 75-cent 'kronut petite' showing off admirable levels of lamination while house-made fillings delivered far better balance in this format than the full-sized versions I'd experienced from Al's in the past.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uqgNQGDC_AQY1f9M3tPsLQ"}

Rarely impressed by potatoes but finding the crispy 'jazz' fries quite addicting as I chatted with the team about the upcoming \"art, music, and entertainment\" it was just prior to noon when my final plate arrived and with both duck and pork crispy yet supple beneath a touch of acid-sweet sauce I immediately swooned, a $12 plate worth the drive from Spring Mountain to The Strip as opposed to the other way around.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bdsKG7MQIMmZ73lgOaTZ0A"}

Small in size but sizable in selection, with ice creams imported from Treat in No.Cal matched to locally baked goods from Al's, Valerio's, and more it was with pleasant conversation about flavor profiles and why specific vendors were chosen that I chatted with Ms. Gonzaga during the course of my visit and sampling several ice creams with results ranging from bold (burgundy cherry, ube) to overly icy and sweet (peach cobbler, macapuno) I eventually opted to invest in the ube alongside the only three items made in house - a duo of cookies and a chocolate brownie, each served hot from the tray.  Beginning first with the ube, apparently oft mistaken for taro by guests, I was immediately taken by the starchy potato textures admixing with cream plus subtle sweetness and pairing this with cookies and crushed peanuts the ice cream sandwich shined, my favorite bites coming at the end as the melted ice cream melded with butter and macadamia nuts with a decidedly tropical tilt.  Moving onward to an option without ice cream, I could not help but order one of the restaurant's brownies when I saw the pan procured fresh from the oven and with dark chips strewn amidst a semi-sweet base the result was decidedly decadent, the sort of thing that would have gone excellent with milk...or as the base of a sundae, the pralines and coffee a seemingly brilliant pairing though I imagine vanilla would work quite nicely as well.\n\nNot quite as impressive as Sweet Addictions if only due to overall lack of house made cookie options I can definitely see Eis Cream improving with time and customer feedback provided the small store can generate enough foot traffic and staying power given its tucked away location on the backside of a strip mall on South Eastern.

Not yet ready to take on spots like Sambalatte or Grouchy John's but obviously much more convenient to the hip-urban crowd it will be interesting to see how this project develops, the brewery next door another clear sign of the direction downtown continues to progress.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sphMxGkYY5OR7uleFxk_WQ"}

Small in size but chock-full of character with exposed beams and cinder-block styling surrounding the central kitchen it was just moments after 11:30 when our trio sat down and after an idiot-proof explanation of a menu \"designed for foodies\" with \"everything is delicious\" idioms aplenty it was on a meal of eleven items that we settled, the majority of the selections coming from those designed to share and each proving well priced given the quality and quantity of ingredients involved.  Clearly leaning on Simon's penchant for comfort food whimsy and benefitted by the skills of Executive Chef Matt Andrews it was specifically at our request that items rolled out of the kitchen with deliberate individual pacing and beginning first with creamy deviled eggs crowned in briny bubbles of roe the hits came quickly, a back-to-back pairing of chicken skins and bacon marmalade each justifying their early 'signature' status while a follow-up of nutty rabbit cooked tender in bright tomatoes over shredded squash showed equally well.  Generally underwhelmed by the meaty lamb 'tacos' wrapped in lightly charred pita and finding the empanada overwhelmed by the onion-heavy sauce it was back on good footing that the kitchen found itself with a deep bowl of crispy sprouts balanced by pork plus balsamic and culminating in a flatbread teaming with mushrooms beneath an especially heady blue it was onward to dessert that we progressed, a trio of options served simultaneously with both the subtly sweet bread pudding and decadent brownie arriving boozed up and bound to impress.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

the descriptive nomenclature offered up by Cory when describing his hopes to use esoteric ingredients not as an upsell or hook, but rather as a means to introduce less adventurous diners to something they may never have otherwise opted to order.\n\nClearly trying to focus on items not tasted during visit one, while also eyeing balanced courses that would not overwhelm our palates too early on, round two featured Kerry's personal favorite fried green beans paired with a surprisingly sweet pepper jelly and cream cheese spread inspired by Harwell's Southern roots, and moving past a strawberry salad that unfortunately fell a bit flat as a result of berries a bit less ripe than one would hope it was here that another exemplary dish arrived, the cast iron crock of creamy crab dip proving absolutely decadent with sharp notes of cheddar carefully melded to the sweet chunks of crustacean spread throughout.\n\nPerhaps overdoing it on the salted pretzel batons served alongside the dip, but admittedly unaware of how much was to come, course three featured two of Carson Kitchen's seasonal sandwiches and although the turkey burger was pleasant enough with spice offset by housemade chutney it was undoubtedly the Cuban that proved the better of the two, a significant upgrade over several watery versions found elsewhere offered through the use of savory pork shoulder topped with pickles, mustard, and Spanish Cheese - even the bread not far off from the crispy pressed paninis served in Miami, Tampa, and other highly praised locations throughout the American Southeast.\n\nTaking it easy on the tots as the table was told three more savories were soon to come, it was admittedly to rolled eyes that Cory told a tale of Carson Kitchen's lauded Mac & Cheese, yet despite the genuine ennui of a dish omnipresent on every American menu in the city Harwell's version achieved the rare feat of truly wowing with both texture and nuance, a similar statement applicable to the seared scallops bathed in citrus and heat though less so to a medium rare piece of beef that seemed to get lost amidst a rich-rub and equally strong sauce.\n\nSomewhat disappointed by the O-Face Bread Pudding and overly-citrus Twinkies from August, but hoping to see Springtime sweets show the same sort of evolution seen in the service, it was with a duo of desserts that the meal would end and again impressed by the richness of a boozed up brownie kept in check by bacon and brown butter ice cream it was unsurprisingly Cory's accented version of banana pudding that immediately stole my heart, the flavors of both the Southern Classic and toffee-tinged English pie suggested through the use of ingredients one rarely associates to either with a texture that eventually saw full bellies making room to scrape the jar clean.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ"}

Intimate in size with a pair of four-tops and a duo of two seaters set beneath subdued chrome lights in hushed dining area decorated with kimono and koi it was just moments before our 5:30 reservation that our group settled in and with beverage service currently limited to non-alcoholic options green tea and sparkling water ordered, our one-man service team keeping cups brimming throughout our seven-course experience while presenting each dish in great detail.  Measured in pace with portions trending small as the two-man kitchen turned out edible works of art without a single detail overlooked it was with a textbook bite of delicate tempura set next to briny baubles of salmon roe that our meal began and progressing next to dishes melding sweet shrimp with tomato sorbet and briny to soft mozzarella the team's creativity took the spotlight early, a large bowl of elegantly plated, though unfortunately common, sashimi selections reigning things in before moving to plates more substantial.  To this point impressed, though not particularly 'wowed' by any single course, it was finally the Sumiyaki that saw all five of us swoon as umami-rich rice provided a crispy juxtaposition to flaky fish and finishing up with reference standard beef, simply prepared with a light kiss from the grill, alongside aromatic mashed potatoes preceding a board of small, elegant desserts plus Japanese 6-hour drip coffee the evening ended strong, no one particularly full but everyone discussing how Las Vegas needs more restaurants of this kind.\n\nUndeniably a dining 'experience' as opposed to a simple meal it will be interesting to see how well Omae fares in its current format, the pricetag apparently prone to an increase of $50 at the end of the month.  Oddly located, though really no more-so than Raku or Kabuto, and easily on par with the skill-set of any Strip-based omakase while proving quite capable of sourcing premium ingredients including A5 Kobe direct from Japan the longevity of Omae will be dependent, largely, on the support of locals and in a city where the 'next big thing' is never more than a week away I truly hope the restaurant finds it audience early on and word of mouth spreads quickly, though I must say even the current pricepoint makes me leery.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cb4YeNdl6MUWis906tzFVQ"}

Truly a daunting menu, both in actual size and scope, it was with seven friends that I sat down just moments after 7:00pm and opting for a wide variety of items marched out by a staff that only once failed by forgetting a buddy's beer I'll simply say that for such a space, particularly in Las Vegas, the service was superior - a strong credit to GM Yassine Lyoubi who greeted me during the early part of the stay.  Perhaps a bit expensive in items listed as starters, snacks, soups, and sandwiches but quick to make up for quantity with quality it was with a few small bites that I began before the rest of my group arrived and with a crispy 'air waffle' seemingly made of glass shattering to foamy foie tinged in honey I soon found myself swooning, the aggressively spiced blood sausage topped in creamy urchin that followed an equally restaurant-defining dish.  Moving next to things more substantial as I sipped a cocktail of lime, raspberry, and gin it should be abundantly obvious that S'mores laced with creamy duck liver were two-bite bits of decadence but far more surprising was the crispy pigskin, a nearly 2x2 foot sheet cracked at the table with a mallet to be dipped in Greek yogurt heavily spiced in sumac and thyme.  Moving next to a dozen fresh oysters as more drinks arrived with another \"wow\" moment delivered by warm cheese-sticks draped in thinly sliced beef that may have represented the meal's best bite.  Onward we went, to a bowl of tripe that quickly silenced skeptics at the table with snappy lobster juxtaposing soft stomach and then to braised lamb neck paired to fried oysters that drew a similar stunned response, and with both dishes quickly finished serving platters arrived - a trio of sides including \"life affirming\" potatoes a la Robuchon presented alongside four pounds of steak and 1/4 suckling pig with skin that crackled to the tooth.  Felt by some to be 'underseasoned,' but particularly impressive from my perspective for allowing the meat's natural flavors to shine, it was only after polishing off nearly every ounce of the scraps that we ended in espresso and dessert - the later a bit of an afterthought considering the pricetag, though the Chocolate and Aged Rum Cake and Pierre Herme inspired pastry are certainly worth the splurge.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the year's splashiest openings, only time will tell whether Bazaar Meat can maintain its early momentum but with an innovative menu and service that shines it already represents one of the best \"Steakhouses\" in Sin City, the 25+ percent price hike on nearly every item stemming from a Las Vegas Boulevard location aside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GjQbbMwu8OzictyBdgYY5g"}

Sparsely decorated but brightly lit, with white porcelain and leather beset by mirrors on both sides, it was just after 5pm that I found myself seated at a table near the back of the space and soon greeted by the first of several servers I couldn't help but be impressed, each smiling face possessing both knowledge and opinions on the cuisine plus a whimsical professionalism far too infrequently seen in Casino dining these days.  Beginning first with dark tea liberally sweetened by coconut milk alongside a light salad, vibrant with mint playing off the sweetness of peeled orange segments, it would not be long before the table was flooded with heavier hitting flavors and presented as a four-part feast the only question was where to start - an answer soon found in the appropriately named \"Lucky 12\" and its four triplets of innovative Siu Mai as each delicate wrapper was stuffed to bursting with poignant flavors set against accoutrements including tobiko, goji berry, and even gold leaf.  Not to be outdone by dim sum the next bites of Ku were of the signature noodles and although future visits will be required to sample other styles I have to say the texture of the thick wheatbelt variety speaks volumes, each tender bite teaming with spice in a broth rendered from lamb neck as pickled radish helped to temper the spice.  Having already heard good things about the bao and happy to confirm that the fist-sized umami-bomb on deep-fried bun is every bit as delicious as its ingredient profile would indicate it was finally in lowly congee that I indulged and although most will eschew such a pedestrian option in a place like this suffice it to say that this is not your mom n' pop rice porridge, the silky stock itself teaming with vibrant spices and all the better for bites imbued with egg, tender vegetables, peanuts, and a whole lot of funk-meets-sweet meat.  At this point quite sated but unable to resist dessert described as 'can't miss' by nearly everyone in the restaurant my final decision of the evening was which of the eight flavors of Taiwanese Shaved Ice to choose and eventually opting for Malted Milk with a trio of toppings plus one sauce I'll simply say that anyone who thinks Snowflake is 'amazing' needs to stop by The SLS ASAP, the $9 bowl more than enough for two to share with rich flavor amidst a stunning texture that you are actually encouraged to experience with chopsticks in order to focus on each snowy crystal...at least until you give into temptation and grab a spoon to fully indulge in a mouthful and never look back until scraping the bowl clean.\n\nUndoubtedly facing an uphill battle in a city where cheap meats and ramen shops speckle Spring Mountain Road, Ku Noodle presents an upscale option for those willing to invest in quality ingredients, innovation, and presentation.  Perhaps my favorite thinkfoodgroup experience to date, outside of 'e,' every single plate at Ku Noodle proves Chef Andres dedication to both quality and creativity while the staff is every bit as well trained, efficient, and pleasant as that at Bazaar - something you surely aren't going to find on Spring Mountain where service is often an afterthought, at best.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QXffVRWRLx3pZzgN9KeQkA"}

Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with an immense parking lot directly next door it will be interesting to see how things develop over the coming months, though I doubt it will take me that long to return considering the bread pudding offered as lunch and dinner dessert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hD4SwSYhhcVvB-IknX2znw"}

Filling out our order, and stomachs, with three pancakes strewn with honey, oats, and cinnamon despite only requesting a 'short stack' and liberally topping the buttery cakes with pure Maple Syrup from Vermont as we finished off a fourth French Press it should probably go without saying that our experience was 'mixed' but with growing pains perhaps to be expected I can only assume service will get better while the food continues to shine...or at least I can hope...", "type": "review", "business_id": "WnBSlcek6ACsjE0UDJ1l2A"}

Eating in a group of locals and visitors, the later a big group of guys in town for The Olympia, it was largely with intentions of touring the menu that our order was crafted and although a few plates of proteins such as eggs and bacon were ordered the 'main event' was five stacks of pancakes and three piles of French Toast served in two rounds - a creamy panCAKE shake lightly tinged with boozy bananas plus plenty of coffee to wash it all down.  Obviously an absurd order, better suited to a table nearly twice our size, it was in the fluffy Good Ol' Fashioned, Peanut Bubba, Chocolate Chip Cookie, and Barry Mellow that we began and with Vermont Maple Syrup gilding many bites both the toasts went quickly, the standard buttermilk flapjacks nearly finished as well.  Moving onward with table cleared and more coffee poured as newly announced GM Adam Scholten watched his team work, round two began with the rich Nutella laden bread again a fan favorite, though the piping hot five-pound plate of flavors spot-on for pumpkin pie was quite delicious as well.  Finding the Barry Yellow a touch too lemony and not particularly well paired to syrup while Room Service and Saturday Morning Fever both fell victim to \"good, but not as good as the rest\" verdicts at a table approaching food-coma it should be obvious to anyone that leftovers were abundant and all packed individually with big bags to be carried the bill was paid, a smile on every face as we waddled back to vehicles with no plans to eat until late that evening.\n\nHaving now found its footing with a service staff that seemed perpetually in motion I'm happy to say that The SLS Griddle Caf\u00e9 is now finally showing promise to be as good as its big brother in LA - the lack of \"off menu\" specials such as the Sweet Fantasy Baby Carrot Cake Pancakes and slow replacement of leaky French presses being resolved by steel replacements the only thing holding them back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WnBSlcek6ACsjE0UDJ1l2A"}

Indulging last in a selection warmed-and-topped-to-order it was finally in The Perq's caramel topped banana monkey bread that I partook and although rumor has it that lunch fares even better than breakfast with cookies, desserts, and gelato-panini taking center stage I'd be hard pressed to imagine any of them better than the textbook brioche pull-apart studded with caramelized bananas, though I unquestionably plan to return and find out, and next time with a cold-brew in hand.", "type": "review", "business_id": "04SjxbgQIhszy2Py0BnLfA"}

Located inside the SLS, under the gleaming guise of the Greek Pharaoh and Starck designed through-and-through, our 6:30 seating started with pleasant greetings at the podium and quickly swept away to a small two-top flanking an open kitchen the service could not have been better, drinks kept brimming throughout the evening and plates arriving in a slow, measured fashion - exactly as requested.  Beset by tagines and spice jars juxtaposing slick surfaces and sparkling chandeliers beneath a lively soundtrack that only rarely interrupted conversation our meal began with a quartet of $7 'mezzes' and with both spreads silky smooth and teaming with flavor atop pillows of Laffa the Kibbeh and creamy spinach puffs were no less special, the former balancing ground lamb to nuts and spice beneath a golden shell.  Moving next to larger plates under simplified headings like \"Vegetables\" and \"Meats\" it was with some disappointment that we were informed the coveted Duck Bastilla was unavailable but making due with four more items both the elegantly paired mushrooms and equally well conceived tagine were quite good while the still-bubbling moussakah was my favorite plate of the night.  A touch underwhelmed by crispy balls of falafel that had trouble standing up to the sauce in which they sat it was in flatbread that our savories finished and with a crisp, charred crust from the central oven likely to make any topping taste better the bitter kale amidst pools of tangy cr\u00e8me fraiche was wonderful, an elegant and light dish I could see playing well to the pre-club crowd heading to LiFE.  At this point approaching nine o'clock, with every seat in the space filled, our meal concluded with coffee alongside a duo of desserts and as much I liked the somewhat out-of-place pudding it was the pannacotta that stole the show - each creamy bite flooding the palate with milky-sweet tones while Amareto soaking the figs lingered at the end.\n\nAlthough higher priced than the typical 'mom n' pop' or Greek festival setting, almost every single item we tasted at Cleo was reference standard, the total bill with tax and tip clocking in just under $160 for nearly three hours of great food, service, and 'scene.'  Certainly not a place for quiet conversation but definitely a spot where both the 'club' crowd or the local looking for a nice night out can be equally comfortable I commend the team at Cleo for bringing something totally new to the scene - it is original concepts like this and Yusho that The Strip really needs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XqpUYK7tjHe_gi0BrNf1sw"}

Speaking next to the quality of the food it can only be said that while perhaps 'simple' by some standards the execution of nearly every dish of the afternoon was nothing short of exemplary and with much of our order trending towards the menu's heavier offerings it was perhaps unsurprising that flavors presented with aplomb, the cheddar biscuits a full-frontal savory assault finding levity in the creamy house blended butter while both the pimento cheese and rich fondue arrived in plethoric portions with extra chips and crackers offered compliments of the house.  Moving next to things more complicated the very few faults of the meal were found in early-season figs that had not yet found maximum sweetness and fries that trended slightly less crisp than savory toppings would afford but with deviled eggs set aside crisp bacon soon followed by reference standard mac n' cheese plus juicy wings rife with smoke beneath intensely crisp skin one would be hard pressed to complain - a trio of All-American sweets every bit on par with the savories finally rounding out a meal that more that lived up to the restaurant's promise of \"good food, good drinks, and good company\" from beginning to end.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CtEMIXdIKSVrU3q1p9cKvg"}

Formerly known as THEcafe, with upgraded d\u00e9cor befitting any number of farm-to-table spots in the current culinary landscape, it was quickly upon checking-in at the podium that we were seated at a large 4-top and, although servers proved a bit overzealous to take orders while coffee and water refills languished, it would require a whole lot of nit-picking to find any fault in the cuisine.  Beginning first with a triplet of tiny biscuits that wowed with complex flavors amidst softly separating layers it was onward to sweeter things that we soon progressed and, although the fluffy pancake was itself quite pleasant, it was the spiraled pecan pastry that stole the spotlight - a veritable deep-dish pecan pie beset on all sides by the  buttery cinnamon roll.  So far impressed it was fast-on-the-heels of appetizers that our entrees arrived and although artificial 'pancake syrup' slightly marred the experience one would be hard pressed to pick a winner amongst the three, the savory open-faced ham sandwich adrift in creamy Mornay atop toasty bread while the custard-soft French Toast and supple waffle beneath a crispy brined breast were each reference standard, the later amongst the best found in Las Vegas to date.\n\nCommanding a pricetag commiserate to its location, and open with the full menu offered as early as 6:30am, Della's Kitchen is a welcome addition to the local breakfast scene and the sort of place I can see only getting better with time.

Joined by two others, one well known to the restaurant, for a lunch beginning just shy of noon it was amidst the cozy modernized confines of a room suited for less than fifty that the meal commenced and with free-flowing tortillas hot and crisp from the kitchen flanked by aromatic salsa not overburdened by heat a strong attention to detail was obvious from the start.\n\nGenerally underwhelmed by Sangria, but told that El Sombrero's was far better than the average grog, a 'one of each' sampling immediately proved the point as bright balance and bold aromatics nuanced each of the infusions and with a duo of strong starters soon to arrive the dominant fruit tones were a welcomed refresher between bites - the creamy Quesillo offering subtle hints of smoke when matched to the Roja while tender ringlets of squid bathed in a murky broth teaming with citrus and spice proved every bit the 'signature' starter that many have claimed - a similar paella presentation apparently offered for special events immediately piquing interest for a future visit with several other options offered for groups as large as sixteen.\n\nTransitioning next to a platter of meats traditionally offered only at dinner suffice it to say that the Parrilladas Del Patron is more than enough to feed two assuming starters are ordered and although the pork short ribs proved a bit too fatty to be fully enjoyed both of the beef options were impressively tender and spiced only enough to let the quality of the meet shine - a similar compliment offered to tender mushrooms while sides of crispy potatoes, tender beans, and pan-scalded corn in light cream were no less than superb.\n\nCertainly a bigger fan of tamales than either of my dining buddies, albeit a bit let down that the restaurant was currently out of brisket, there is no doubt in my mind that Oscar's Tamal de Pollo is the least heavy-handed I've tasted to date and with garlic tinged tomatillo sauce melding nicely to the sweet corn it was the roasted chicken that truly made the plate shine, a statement almost equally well suited to the tender-roast bird beneath the sort of mole uncommonly seen at all but the most authentic of spots, a 'dirty' dark sauce teaming with spice with only the slightest cocoa linger as opposed to the sugar-sweet chocolate syrup popularized by more Americanized spots.\n\nFinishing the afternoon with the restaurant's only daily dessert, a pleasant bread pudding with silky-soft texture doused in dulce de leche, it was once again here that Chef Sanchez arrived tableside to make sure all was well and with compliments and thanks paid to the chef and servers any lamenting the closure of the original El Sombrero should find consolation in the fact that sometimes the right team really can teach an old dog some new tricks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9eYvD9isKnk1TvZ5LX5C1Q"}

Comes with Smash Browns\" actually comes with the spuds, regardless of what the subtext says.\n\nOffering breakfast all day, and the rest of the menu from 11a until 11p, Pantry is located at the back of The Mirage and with an open caf\u00e9 up-front overlooking the gaming floor and a more cozy family-style dining area in back it was in the latter that we sat, a large four-top easily big enough for six set for just three soon greeted by a middle-aged waitress named Rina who dutifully pushed coffee (an excellent roast from La Colombe charged at $5 per pot, without free refills, though diners are left to discover that for themselves) before filling water and taking orders, the request for items to be coursed out loosely adhered to until it was reinforced after round two landed atop quarter-finished baked goods.\n\nTold that the donuts could not be included in the 'mix & match' because it was \"in a box, see\" and then served only one biscuit, instead of the menu-listed two, because \"it was part of the mix & match\" as though one was supposed to infer this information for themselves, suffice it to say that at $9 the biscuit and two muffins were still a veritable bargain considering the quality and although the donut bites were a bit steep at $5 for six, the crispy sugar shell over a light brioche center was every bit as good as those at Puck's Postrio which carry a tariff several dollars more - the addition of locally sourced honey, whipped butter, and two types of housemade jam the sort of small details I'd gladly pay a premium for whether dining near home or on the Strip.\n\nSitting, chatting, and enjoying the first round it was less than five minutes later that a man arrived porting two plates and setting aside the muffins and donuts while informing him to put the brakes on expediting the next course it was soon in chicken and waffles alongside huevos rancheros that we partook, neither served with the 'smashed browns' advertised on the menu but both again showing the work of a confident kitchen working with quality ingredients, the crispy tortillas beneath eggs and accoutrements featuring no lack of dynamic flavors or textures while as the spicy chicken featured skin that crackled to the tooth atop a supple and aromatic waffle more than ready to sop up plenty of pure maple syrup served in a sizeable sidecar.\n\nTransitioning back to sweets, another pot of coffee elected even after assuming the upcharge based on the menu's description, it was perhaps a gluttonous choice to pick both the pancake of the week and four-piece French Toast when eating with friends generally not the sort to indulge in such things but never one to shy away from over-ordering to experience the best of what a place has to offer it was honestly a surprise to even myself just how excellent Pantry's griddles were, the decadent custard soaked brioche cooked golden and topped with rich mascarpone plus plenty of berries featuring far more chopped chocolate than one would have ever assumed while the fluffy flapjack trio was not only topped with housemade strawberry jam and freshly sliced berries but also imbued with strawberries and cream in the batter and layered between each cake, a large dollop of whip and a small ball of ice cream added to finish perhaps a bit unnecessary, though I certainly didn't hear anyone complain.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfounded by a menu seemingly built to confuse and up-sell with the sort of service that is trained to turn tables it is almost as if Pantry does not know just how good the food coming out of the kitchen really is, particularly for a 24-hour spot on the Strip - a bit more attention to detail from the front of house would go a long way to giving the chefs the credit they deserve.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FqhEd4vV6Hg-0J49hBShUQ"}

Described by director of development Flip Arbelaez as a 'fusion' of styles, both in food and d\u00e9cor, with design concepts ranging from reclaimed barn wood and mason jar chandeliers to a slick marble bar at the restaurant center the majority of our meal at Pot Liquor CAS was paired to sounds far more 'urban' than Southern but looking squarely at the 'cue from a tightly regulated indoor smoker burning a blend of woods low-and-slow at 250\u00b0F there was nothing at all to suggest the cuisine to be that of some city-slicker.  Unfortunately sold out of the pulled pork given our late hour of arrival and additionally limited on desserts which, save for a few, are not yet available it was with a focus on the remaining variety of smoked meats that our order was crafted and with our server literally cheering us on in phrases like \"yeah, I like that\" or \"that's totally what I'd do\" it was not long before our order arrived, a single appetizer of crisp but under-seasoned pork belly over buttery ground corn plus a large pair of plates featuring more than enough meat and sides to be shared.  Beginning first with tender sliced beef featuring a substantial waft of smoke but otherwise seasoned in only salt and pepper I'm confident in saying that Pot Liquor already offers the best brisket in Sin City and moving onward to snappy house-made hot links that paired beautifully with the mayonnaise and horseradish white sauce I was again impressed, the somewhat dry spare ribs a small step in the wrong direction though falling-from-the-bone baby backs were a return to form and easily on par with Rollin' Smoke, though commanding nearly twice the price even without accounting for the AYCE option at the longstanding Vegas favorite.  A bit underwhelmed by sides, particularly the skimpy portion of cornbread that commands a $5.95 menu price, it was in a duo of the three available desserts that we rounded out the night and with each option carrying a $6 pricetag the brownie-beneath-a-croissant style bread pudding proved unquestionably a must order, the nearly molten chocolate base well suited to blend nicely with slowly melting ice cream rife in vanilla amidst ample amounts of butter.\n\nClearly more corporate than the traditional Southern Smokehouse yet innovative in their scientific approach to barbeque with a controlled temperature in-house smoker it will be interesting to see just how Las Vegans respond to Pot Liquor CAS, the high tariff likely to turn some away in a city where good barbeque is sorely underrepresented and many seem satisfied by the swill being turned out by Famous Dave's at less than half the price.  With everything made in-house including brines, bacon, hot links, and a wide array of sauces it should go without saying that these guys are dedicated to what they do and with a high likelihood to only improve with time and customer feedback I look forward to a return visit sometime before year's end - hopefully to find the 'cue consistent, if not bettered by a well seasoned smoker, with sides and the music turned down...or at least tuned to something more befitting the sort of cuisine being served.", "type": "review", "business_id": "H3SaoIWnlG-HvGQ8v6J6yg"}

Apparently once a Ruby Tuesday, with a sunny patio offering an al fresco option to those not sold on modest Mardi Gras d\u00e9cor, our party of three was sat quickly at a cozy four-top and with the dining room mostly empty while the bar bustled with football our service could not have been better, a duo of young ladies eager to answer questions and seek feedback while beverages remained brimming.   Happily conversing beneath upbeat Cajun instrumentals it would not be long after ordering that the first round of food would arrive and although beignets were a bit too 'bready' while Leidenheimer French Toast proved overpriced and underwhelming compared to the restaurant's signature bread pudding both the supple cinnamon roll and spicy sausage were excellent, the later a recurring theme in round two.  Admittedly a bit disappointed in the lack of oysters on the brunch menu, but soon to find solace in items offered as \"signatures,\" it was with two plates of creamy gouda grits that the meal moved on and with the stick-a-spoon-up-straight base punched up by rich mushroom gravy and snappy Andouille both the shrimp and flaky fish equally shined, an order of chicken and waffles entirely forgettable in the face of such greatness as I mopped the bowls clean with complimentary grilled bread loaded with garlic.  At last arriving at dessert, the full menu offered in addition to two specials, it seemed only proper to select the items designated as Lola's signatures and although the soft chocolate cake was light yet intense while the hybrid pie was truly a 'best of both worlds' amalgam of sweet and savory neither could compare to the bread pudding - a steamy block of custard teaming with cinnamon beneath praline crunch and brown sugar sauce tinged with rum.\n\nLong lamented for being a cookie-cutter planned community where PF Changs and Olive Garden continue to generate long lines, Lola's is a welcome addition to the area and the sort of place I can only hope continues to proliferate West as \"Downtown Summerlin\" develops.  Obviously new and still finding its footing, particularly with regard to a 'brunch' menu that seems muddled and poorly conceptualized in its lack of NOLA favorites like oysters or crawfish, I look forward to seeing how the restaurant evolves over time and only hope that the unwieldy location does not prove too daunting for those preferring to stick to the same ol' same ol' spots further south.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-ERMB7X_XZvr-XPK32ii4g"}

the service knowledgeable and efficient as General Manager Jennifer stopped by each table to make sure all was well.\n\nWhimsically designed with Latin American themes played out everywhere from the walls to the plates as similarly themed music plays just loud enough to keep the space lively without being loud, it was just moments after orders were placed that a bowl of fresh fruit arrived alongside a duo of fruity cheese empanadas and soon in their wake came an equally impressive quartet - the housemade biscuits anchoring both the PBJ and Benedict better than almost any offered in Sin City and all the more impressive when accounting for toppings that came through with bold aromatics and plenty of balance, each one amongst the very best of the brunch.\n\nAt this point ordering one-to-two plates each over the course of three more rounds of items mostly-savory it was in gauging each other's reaction that subsequent dishes were selected and with the exception of Johnny cakes that were thin while generally lacking in flavor and breakfast fries that fell flaccid beneath otherwise impressive accoutrements every other item sampled was a resounding success, the coulis tying the chicken and waffles together in a very unexpected manner while the creamy oyster in light tempura presented a perfect bite of smoke, acid, and brine...the sort of plate I'd have gladly ordered a dozen of were there not so much else to try.\n\nTurning attention to dessert it was only here that an item from Border Grill's a la carte menu was selected and flanked by delicate 'churro tots' that eat like hot cinnamon donuts as well as bread pudding style French Toast that works funky goat cheese into the mix with the flavors of maple and sour cherries it can only be said that the Rice Pudding is every bit as good as the rumors, a deep bowl for a mere $9 easily the best offered in Las Vegas and already an early contender for the 2015 best dessert list with \"stick-a-spoon-up-straight\" yet silky texture complimented by a lengthy shortbread topped in caramelized banana bites. \n\nAt first considered a bit redundant given the Mandalay Bay location just a few minutes away it will be interesting to see if both Border Grill locations can sustain in an environment ever prone to closure and reinvention and while not everything was 'perfect' the $34.99 menu still offers a high ratio of hits to misses while the full a la carte menu is also available to those looking for something more...or, depending on appetite, perhaps 'less.'", "type": "review", "business_id": "FvDa81O48IZx_LhjSiv_bQ"}

Every bit the trendy spot, but comfortable with several seating options and a soundtrack ranging from Taylor Swift to The Doors, the experience at Hearthstone begins with vibe and featuring a staff already exceedingly well trained and exuberant in their discussion of the food and drink the large menu is the sort that could just as easily seen in Chicago, Los Angeles, or even New York - a wide selection of shared plates, snacks, cheese, and charcuterie alongside a few 'entrees' and desserts.  \n\nSeated at a raised leather booth, overlooking the kitchen where Massie and his team worked non-stop in front of wood burning ovens turning out pie after pie, it was in a selection of housemade charcuteries, spreads, and bread from Bon Breads that the meal began and with both the rillette and ricotta truly standout alongside truffled honey as well as reduced balsamic cream the \"FGJ\" only found its footing after being allowed fifteen minutes to warm up, the texture then smooth enough to spread athough the accompanying brioche had long since cooled down.  Sipping the well balanced and whimsical \"Honey Badger\" as I awaited round two, it would not be long before a flatbread and two sides arrived and with a well blistered crust bolstering the flavor profile of cracked pepper, onions, and pork beneath an egg added tableside the only thing that prevented me from devouring the whole \"Carbonara\" immediately was the quality of the sides, a creamy low-bowl of polenta teaming with butter poached lobster while the squash was a perfect taste of autumn - a substantial plate for $7 and perhaps the best bites of the night.  \n\nAt this point quite sated it was an unexpected surprise that the team opted to send out a few more items to try and although I cannot say the tuna did much for me as I generally find the fish to be quite boring, the scallop tartare was absolutely silken in texture with a bold hit of acid up front and light heat on the finish.  Rounding out the savories with a salad far more interesting than I'd have guessed and charred octopus no less fabulous than that at Carnevino atop an admixture of brine and smoke it was onward to dessert that the meal progressed and although the apple tart was already sold out the highly recommended pudding and seemingly overplayed 'lava cake' both showed strongly, neither exceedingly sweet and the cake especially remarkable when the crowd-pleasing center poured forth with a flavor of pure roasted peanuts and bananas rather than some sugary concoction that could have unbalanced the whole plate.\n\nDeclined any form of a check and thus presenting an uncomfortable situation where I emptied the limited cash in my wallet in order to compensate the stellar service I'd originally considered reserving my opinions for a second visit, but evaluating the cuisine and experience as objectively as I can I'll simply say that Hearthstone has the potential to be very special, particularly given its location.  As yet still finding its footing and offering a menu that seems a bit 'everything to everyone' it will be very interesting to see how Light Group tries to bring locals out to Red Rock for such a large and aggressive concept, but with plans for daily specials and prices trending far lower than similar spots on the strip I'd suggest that the average couple could easily compose a great meal here for less than $100 by focusing on small plates and come away very happy, the well-culled charcuterie selection and a cocktail also presenting an option for those looking for an after-work hangout or a light bite before a night out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "va89GS1Zh402L4v-iY0Urw"}

the Kouign Amann and Croissant a touch flaccid despite good flavors while the raisin snail and canele were both excellent, the later a large scale rendition with crisp shell and custard center that I'd suggest is the best in the city and something I'd love to taste warm and just set.\n\nPresented next with two styles of pate, the first a rough cut pork composition rich with funk and nuts while the foie was pure velvet beneath a port gelee glaze, it was with extra crunchy bread that each bite was enjoyed, and following up with a crispy crust topped in pork and onions with a smoky top note the first true 'showstopper' of the morning arrived in the form of a crab-topped crepe - the hearty buckwheat base, tender mushrooms, and copious serving of sweet crab all noteworthy but the tableside addition of beurre blanc melding it all together and putting it over the top.\n\nPleasantly surprised by the beefy sapor and balanced sweetness of the onion soup, a 'must order' item for one of my friends, and more than a little impressed by snails served out of their shell in the form of garlicky 'popcorn escargot' beneath light breading entirely devoid of grease it was onward to more brunchy items that the meal progressed and with the soft malted sourdough waffle proving a stunning foil to the crispy confit duck while the Croque was nothing short of the high standard set at Bouchon it was the thick-cut French Toast that undoubtedly stole the show - a custard soaked masterpiece with golden edges reminding me of the landmark version served at LeMeac in Montreal.\n\nAdmittedly a bit lacking in pastas as the meal moved into entrees and sides, the cleverly presented macaroni unfortunately a bit too salty while tender gnocchi and mushrooms were a bit muddled beneath a touch too much garlic, one should pay close attention to the chicken at Bardot just as they should at any of Michael Mina's restaurants, and with comments speaking of Peking Duck as relates to crackling skin the flesh of the brined bird was equally impressive, each herbaceous bite tender and juicy with snappy beans and rich mushroom pudding at its side.\n\nEnding with dessert, three of the menus' six options selected to be shared, it comes as no surprise that a Mina restaurant finishes strong with sweets and although both the macaron and tarte tatin are excellent with a tableside finish it is the mille-feuille that steals the show, each flaky layer of pastry shattering to the fork as delicate pastry cream presents silky, sweet, and almost as light as air.\n\nAlready impressive at just a few weeks in, and executing French classics at a level as good or better than any similar Stateside restaurant, Bardot looks to raise the bar for mid-range French cuisine in Las Vegas -

the scene far different than trendy South Beach, but the cuisine and culture inside the restaurant every bit as good, if not better than the Beard Nominated Florida flagship.\n\nLarge in size and aggressive in scope, with a menu covering lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch, Yardbird is the first Las Vegas expansion for the 50 Eggs restaurant group and overseen from its conceptualization by Chef Harrington with a kitchen far exceeding the capacity of the original and a dining room tinged in upscale rustic d\u00e9cor as classic southern blues and jazz fill the air the dining area itself feels a hundred miles from the slots machines outside and seated in a small alcove to the side of a wide-open kitchen it was not long after seating that our server arrived, both she and each of her assistants already well versed in the menu and its roots while the Chef and GM filled diners in on new techniques including the use of sous vide, extensive brining, and a double smoker that set many of the plates apart from the Yardbird on Miami Beach.\n\nLargely allowing the kitchen to send out plates they felt best expressed the restaurant's vision, while also making a few specific requests, it was with the restaurant's signature lemonade that the evening got started and soon joined by a trio of small-plates both the deviled eggs and the whimsical BLT proved well balanced and expertly crafted while the chunky terrine was every bit on-par with the version at Daniel Boulud's spot next door - a high bit of praise, to be sure.\n\nMoving onward to fried pickles that featured delicate batter and were about as good as such an 'acquired taste' dish can be plus macaroni and cheese that was rather par for the course it was here that restaurant's signature ingredient made its first appearance, and nestled inside a golden biscuit tinged with sweetness that immediately sets a new standard for Sin City the fried chicken was likewise beyond reproach, each bite crisp and juicy with the flavor profile further enhanced by the in-house pickling program plus sweet n' spicy jam.\n\nTreated next to two salads alongside a thick smear of chicken liver that proved so smooth and well balanced by the relish that it could have easily been mistaken for foie gras, suffice it to say that while the tomato salad was a perfect mid-meal palate cleanse of aromatics and acid Chef Harrington's Low and Slow was perhaps the most unexpectedly impressive plate of the whole meal, each smoky bite of chicken almost melting on the tongue while crispy fried cornbread and greens added texture and their own complimentary flavors to the mix.\n\nAt this point admittedly well-sated it was still to gluttonous eyes that Yardbird's signature plate arrived and with the house-brined bird so juicy that white meat was nearly indistinguishable from dark it warrants mention that the version served here in Las Vegas was more impressive in all ways than the one on which the 50 Eggs empire was built - the same to be said of the waffles, which were more cheesy and crisp, though if one must quibble the watermelon could have stood to be a touch more sweet.\n\nOffered tea and coffee, both of which were gladly accepted with sweets set to follow, the pastry chef  soon stopped by to say hello and explaining that the current menu is largely cribbed from that in South Beach with Sin City specific items soon to follow it was to her judgment that we deferred - an overwhelming trio arriving that spanned from dainty bombolini stuffed with Key Lime curd to piping hot bread pudding studded with pretzels, caramel corn, and candy both standing in the shadow of an immense slice of cake that walked a fine line between sweet and savory, the ice cream giving it a boozy kick and making me wish I'd have saved room to enjoy a few bites more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VheAZ3k8hL4QJTFxpeFGmA"}

the woman responsible for twelve sweet selections which frequently left me dumbfounded that they weren't the result of some old recipe from a grandma down South.\n\nBeginning first with brunch selections, suffice it to say that the retooled brioche donuts are a dramatic improvement on the longjohn of past and with each tender, maple-lacquered bite studded by crispy bacon the ante is further upped by a sidecar of sauce, a gluttonous accoutrement I nonetheless found myself dipping into frequently and later adding to the buttery apple pies, one eaten by hand with the second cut up and mixed with ice cream, graham crackers, and the aforementioned caramel for one heck of a makeshift sundae.\n\nContinuing the morning-meal options, another re-imagined item from Todd and Vivian was presented in the form of 'smoked' coffee cake and although the young chef claims the moist bread is only stored in the smoker for two minutes the result is a substantial hint of hickory with chocolate chips and robust coffee ice cream adding just a bit of sweetness, a task completely unnecessary when enjoying the sorghum sweetened chess pie whose creamy texture atop an all-butter crust rivals the best I've experienced anywhere in Amish country or the Southeast.\n\nTransitioning to dinner desserts, both Yardbird's signature Bacon Butterscotch Cake and Crunch n' Munch Bread Pudding remain largely unchanged, the latter's popcorn flavor scaled back a bit in order to let the dark chocolate notes better shine, but with six other desserts also available one would be hard pressed to decide which was 'best,' though large groups would be strongly encouraged to look into either the bubbling hot and simply delicious seasonal cobbler or rich Red Velvet Whoopie Pie as each are more than enough to share with the former currently featuring blueberries and blackberries while the silky cream cheese mousse of the whoopie pie is simply too much for even a hearty due of diners to tackle on their own...no matter how much they may wish to try.\n\nDecidedly not a place for 'light' desserts, but one where a few smaller portions can be found, chocaholics and those interested in a true Southern delicacy would be well suited to order the chocolate chess pie served with both the orange blossom ice cream and blood orange marmalade to help to balance out the cocoa's substantial heft while those looking for something a bit more 'fun' should find exactly what they're looking for in Chang's inspired take on fried Oreos, the oft-oily 'fair-food' staple perfected by protecting the cookie's texture with batter while rice crispies add texture to both the dough and as a chocolate covered topping to the ball of ice cream at the center of the plate.\n\nConsistently impressing with both the variety and quality of house-made ice creams it seems only logical that Chang opts to feature them in so many of the restaurant's desserts, and rounding out the restaurant's dozen offerings one would be well advised to consider either the upscale Banana Split or Bourbon Milk Shake to finish off their meal, the shake a drink best shared given its substantial portion even though the booze is very nicely balanced by both the vanilla ice cream and whip while the sundae is perhaps the most unexpected surprise on the menu as two types of ice cream along with banana pudding, caramel popcorn, chocolate sauce, graham crackers, and a torched banana provide a veritable 'choose your own adventure' of textures and flavors without a single underwhelming bite to be found.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VheAZ3k8hL4QJTFxpeFGmA"}

or even Summerlin, really - anyone who has lived in the Las Vegas area for more than a few months is likely to have heard the difficulties faced by restaurants inhabiting Tivoli Village, yet earlier this week it was none other than former Michelin 2* Chef Alex Stratta who decided to challenge history, his Tapas by Alex Stratta opening in the space formerly inhabited by Poppy Den with a menu that immediately had me thinking \"he's going to do that, there?\"\n\nLast seeing Chef Stratta's cooking at his Wynn flagship in September of 2008, one of my first fine dining experiences in Las Vegas, it was just after 6:00pm on Saturday that myself and five others sat down at a small table just inside the lively al fresco dining patio and with service that was exceedingly professional, if not a bit overbearing with descriptions, guiding the rest of the evening a large order was crafted in several rounds, a total of twenty tapas tasted over the course of three hours bookended by refreshing glass of sangria and some of the richest, sweetest sherry I've tasted in ages.\n\nTaking a surprisingly traditional approach to Spanish small plates, the menu divided into six sections with several options available to please most dietary restrictions, it was largely in items from the menu's front side that selections were made and although prices trend a bit higher than they probably should for dishes like the $25 Foie Gras, $10 Croquetas, $15 Fried Oysters, or $18 Deviled Eggs with Caviar and Bottarga it would be a fool's folly to question the quality of any of the ingredients or preparation - each on par with the best versions in town.\n\nConvivial in atmosphere, with plates intended to be shared despite portions that do trend small, other classic options selected amongst savories entailed spot-on presentations of Patatas Bravas as well as Potato Tortilla and although requests for extra bread had to be made more than once both the Baked Monte Enebro with crunchy pistachios and the unctuous Bone Marrow Dip were absolute showstoppers, the former an absolute must order for anyone fancying funky cheeses while the later was silky smooth and complicated without being fussy one bit.\n\nExecuting standards like dates as well as octopus with a deft hand, and somehow finding a way to present crispy fried kale as a novelty amidst accoutrements both sour and sweet, diners looking for more bold flavors would be well served to order a plate or two of the unexpectedly chilled salt cod with citrus while those desiring something slightly less 'fishy' should turn their eyes towards the intensely flavorful roasted eggplant with dainty chickpea crisps or the deceptively described \"Saffron Alioli\" that seamlessly pairs soft bread and caramelized onions to light heat and aromatic sauce that saw both bowls eventually wiped clean.\n\nDenied the 'daily specials,' which are not yet ready to roll out on their pre-specified days of the week, it was with much anticipation that one of the restaurant's four signature paellas was presented to the table and showing the gusto of a chef willing to take chances the Valenciana iteration of the dish proved to be the undeniable star of the evening, an enormous portion priced a bit aggressively at $26/pp with both the bunny and escargot shown off in full form, with little done to mask their characteristic flavors, while rice ran the gamut from a fluffy top-layer rife with aromatics right down to the blistered bits that stuck to the pan, a bit of scraping well rewarded with plenty of concentrated flavor that added even more texture and just a touch of char.\n\nTransitioning to sweets with a double espresso on ice that saw itself, like water refills, long delayed it was perhaps unsurprising that desserts at Tapas were mostly authentic old world recipes with top-tier ingredients and skilled staff serving to add panache, and although the airy Bunuelos, perfect churros, and cake tinged in chocolate and sherry were all admittedly quite good it was a trio of spoon soft delicacies that undoubtedly stole the show as rice pudding proved a textural masterpiece rivaled only by Border Grill for best in the city while a chilly semifreddo speckled with fruits and nuts was everything a holiday fruitcake is not - soft, smooth, and something craveable year round.\n\nStill new, with kinks in service and pricing yet to be worked out, Tapas by Alex Stratta faces an uphill battle selling traditional tapas in a development where Brio has wait-times while more innovative spots sit empty or shut their doors, but clearly harboring the sort of passion and talent ready to reward those willing to take a chance with some of the city's best Spanish Cuisine this is the sort of place that Tivoli and Summerlin needs, whether it knows it or not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XaNkj7C0-4yERZ9Sysu1fQ"}

a total of fifteen plates featuring nearly two-dozen impressive items enjoyed at a grand total of $116 before tax and tip.\n\nWide ranging in scope, with a menu still in flux, the overall concept behind Inyo is best described as 'tapas' and without a single item ringing in at more than $9.95, with several less than five bucks, it seems almost impossible that the quality of produce, protein, and technique is as impressive as a first look would indicate - the chef clearly using the knowledge gleaned in fine dining environs to select local producers and sources allowing the cuisine to shine while offering a veritable bargain to those finding their way through Inyo's front door.\n\nStarting off with one of several styles of tea, repeatedly filled throughout the evening by Mr. Chen who proved to be a perfect host, it was in a selection of pickles ranging from Japan to Korea that the meal began and quickly transitioning to  a quartet of cold plates one would be hard pressed to decide which of the options was most impressive, the shredded tartare melting on the tongue with fried lotus chips offered for texture while both the thinly sliced Hirame and silken tofu were enlivened by acid as opposed to getting lost in it, a similar statement applicable to crispy Suomono served to cleanse the palate between fish.\n\nTransitioning next to warm tapas it was unfortunate that a few of the smaller clams served as part of Yaki Hama were a bit dried out when compared to larger specimens, but moving on to a course of braised pork belly paired to a large cut of daikon cooked nearly as tender the small gaff was almost immediately forgotten, a follow-up sampling of each of the restaurant's three styles of wings proving an abrupt textural change-of-pace with crispy skin overlying juicy flesh and spice profiles that challenged my Midwestern palate with the heated Gochugaru while dialing it back and slapping the tastebuds with umami and sweetness in the Japanese Tebasaki style quartet.\n\nAt this point opting to show off his skills with the Binchotan charcoal grill it was to six skewers that the table was treated and paired with three different salts, the best flecked with Toagarashi, it would again be a challenge to name a 'best of,' though all things being equal none were quite as impressive as the items served at Raku just a few weeks prior - even though they did tally a significantly lower charge.\n\nEntering the home stretch with a low bowl filled with tender cubed steak topped by crispy garlic alongside what is perhaps the best $6.95 one can spend on Spring Mountain in the form of a large bowl of glistening fried rice teaming with picked crab beneath a crown of fried egg it was suddenly here that we found ourselves the only patrons left in the place and although desserts would prove light and elegant, if not particularly 'memorable,' the overall experience is one I'll not wait long to revisit - a skilled chef and passionate owner already showing promise to do big things.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlready impressive in their first week of service, while operating with a skeleton crew, suffice it to say that with a few menu tweaks Inyo truly could be Chinatown's \"Next Big Thing,\" a phrase often trumpeted for far less qualified kitchens dotted up and down Spring Mountain as well as Las Vegas Blvd South that charge upwards of twice the price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n3Ibd2BPL4_v7XMxNOZAPA"}

our server not really offering much aside from the occasional water refill and dropping-off of plates.\n\nLocated in a small plaza off Paradise, just a minute from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino by car, Urban Turban is the sort of place one wants to like on entering, and with largely benign d\u00e9cor aside from the whimsical rickshaw sitting beside the hostess podium the focus seems to be on the food moreso than the scene - a wide view of a gleaming kitchen flanked by chalkboards revealing a number of Chef's working diligently on plates whose results would unfortunately prove average, at best.\n\nStarting off with appetizers before progressing to proper plates and curries it was with a trio of free Papadum that the meal began and with the flavor mostly that of oil it was thankfully the mango chutney that made the crisp pastry far more interesting, though the green 'mint' version was flavored much like bile - overly heated, viciously acidic, and not particularly something one should strive for in any sort of cuisine.\n\nNext served a quintet of plates that quickly covered the table it was with some confusion that I looked upon a menu item described as \"Dry Fruit Whole Wheat Bread\" and with neither fruit nor nuts evident I attest to this moment we were simply served the wrong thing, though the server assured us this was indeed the correct item.\n\nLargely ignoring the lack of fruit and instead using the 'whole wheat' Naan to scoop up the first bites of a duo of Pav, suffice it to say that unless one is vegetarian the Lamb version shows far superior to a more traditional take that serves as little more than muddled vegetable mush meant to be served on bread and turning attention to an impressive Paneer Tikka presentation with tangy cubes amidst earthy aromatics it was a thankful circumstance that the Samosa Chat was only lightly drizzled with green chutney, thus allowing one to augment the largely flavorless pocket with the red version instead.\n\nInvesting the rest of our appetites in bottomless curries that featured excellent basmati rice and par-for-the-course buttered Naan alongside bowls containing less than two ounces of protein each, it can only be said that at prices ranging $10-$17 the better bet is to visit one of the many local Indian buffets if one is merely looking for a 'fill up' and partaking lightly in the dirty tasting Lamb Masala as well as overly sweet Buttered Chicken a bit of credit is due to the owner for suggesting the seemingly out-of-place noodles - a show stopper of well-tuned aromatics that at least gives one hope that the kitchen could improve the rest of the recipes as time goes on.\n\nOrdering three Paan Shots that again saw the kitchen offer up something balanced and refined it was largely the lack of traditional Indian desserts that led to the final selection of Chocolate Samosas, but having experienced a similarly underwhelming dessert at Nosh & Swig just a few months prior it can only be said that this one was slightly better - the house made ice cream and melted chocolate at least helping to offset the same oily taste that had marred the papadum, though the $7.95 price tag seemed rather excessive for something so underwhelming and small.\n\nSuggested as 'urban tapas,' and thus seeming to purport a modern take on tradition, Urban Turban really only seems to shine when sticking to simpler plates and with ingredients that really seem no better than the typical Indian Buffet in an environment that does little to wow there seems very little reason to return, let alone support another restaurant import when places like Mint seem to be satisfying locals just fine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eInPqZl-uobjndn_Mk6VvA"}

If this early visit is any indication I anticipate great things to come; 'mg' and modernism aside, this is a place that knows its way around classic French pastry, not to mention ice cream and customer service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3iOE39mT91wgONX0AbZupg"}

the goat cheese marrying nicely to the thickly sliced beets on soft rye while the briny ham and crisp apples melded beneath a veil of melted cheese.\n\nUnfortunately informed that the Ice Cream Malt Cake had sold out during the Grand Opening it was with a duo, rather than a three, desserts that the meal would end and while I admit to being an absolute sucker for any form of bread pudding it was actually the chocolate cake that stole the show, the substantial cocoa notes finding a whole new level when paired to frosting imbued with bitter stout...though that isn't to say I didn't scrape every bit of the boozy bread pudding plate clean, either...just that the cake is possibly the best I've found in this city to date.\n\nStill a work in progress, the d\u00e9cor needing a bit of work while some sort of sound absorption would go a long way in protecting diners from overwrought kids, there is undoubtedly a lot to love about Old School Brewing Company even for those who do not personally favor beer, a strong compliment to a place that could just as easily mail-it-in with the same boring menu as any number of other 24/7 spots but instead chooses to break the mold.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3o4QIYR5JPmCMAaNVjY4HQ"}

Interesting for their take on the fritter, and offering a fairly interesting selection of daily specials as well as enormous 'party donuts' there is no doubt I'll be back to reevaluate in a few months - hopefully finding service issues and paranoia to be remedied, or at least scaled back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6MC-Ojl29-8N0Cg7ybAIPA"}

a total of four plates when accounting for the crunchy-yet-pliable bagel accompanying a smoky onion laced omelet beneath a veil of velvety lox, the two additional plates some of the best of the morning with the pillowy pancakes heavily imbued in both buttermilk and berries while Huevos Rancheros showed a surprising degree of restraint, the heat dialed back compared to most in order to let the quality of both the chorizo and creamy beans beneath cheese to shine.\n\nTempering my predilections to clear each plate, thankfully warned by both Lisa and Adam of what was to come, the second threesome arrived in the form of two savories alongside one sweet and although the Chilaquiles Verdes proved rather uninspired with far too little meat and a degree of acidity I personally found to overwhelming, both the forearm-thick burrito and reference-standard waffle were the sort of plates worth getting out of bed for, the first densely packed with at least a pound of rich flavors and satisfying textures while the later featured a caramelized exterior that crackled to fork pressure before giving way to a yeasty, soft center that paired beautifully to fresh berries and thick whipped-cream plus a drizzle of maple.\n\nAt this point transitioning to 2:1 sweets to savories for the second half of the morning it was three items designated as \"Northside Favorites\" that arrived and although the 'hash' was decidedly non-traditional, with two perfectly poached eggs atop thick-cut griddled spuds beneath a tangy blend of Jalapenos and salsa verde, the flavor profile worked very nicely - particularly in contrast to thick-cut French Toast that was rendered incredibly rich by a slathering of whipped cream, chocolate, as well as Nutella and a stack of shredded carrot pancakes studded with nuts as well as raisins beneath sweet yet tangy creamy cheese, the later a strong contender for the city's most delicious pancake and better than any served at TGC in both texture and taste.\n\nAt this point plenty sated, but happy to experience a few more things, suffice it to say that the 'Whole Hog' Omelet is not for those looking for something light and with what I can only assume to be a 50/50 balance of meat and cheese to eggs the flavor profile is exactly what one would expect, a lot of salt and sapor with just a touch of spice, the perfect counterpart to cocoa-rich Red Velvet pancakes as well as the menu's undeniable hidden gem, a stunning and surprisingly healthy sundae comprised of frozen layers of Greek yogurt intermingling with fresh berries and crunchy granola -

the grilled vegetables and pork belly both highlights from round one while the flavor of the lobster was almost entirely lost amidst its accoutrements and foie gras trended a touch pricey considering its small size.\n\nThankfully giving time to photograph, chat, and exchange opinions of plates before queuing up course two it was again that the service structure at Andiron saw a plethora of plates arrive shortly after those from round one were cleared, and having opted to pair three entrees to four sides the results were surprisingly similar to that already experienced, both the Tomahawk Chop and Crispy Pork Schnitzel prepared as good as any off-Strip while the Linguini was texturally mushy, the carrots proving the high-point of the sides mainly as a result of the ginger puree beneath while the clever macaroni waffle was far better than the first time around in part due to the cheesy sauce added tableside.\n\nNever one to shy away from sweets, though admittedly a bit disappointed that the tarte tatin and ice box cake listed online have been deep-sixed in favor of chocolate pudding cake and an admittedly impressive cherry clafoutis, it was with a quintet of complimentary desserts that the meal would end and as much as the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e donuts may indeed get all the press it was actually the aforementioned almond cake alongside the Brown Butter Lemon Pie that saw everyone smiling in agreement - the later a dessert ranking high amongst Las Vegas' very best.\n\nThus far a hit as the restaurant was nearly 90% full on a Friday evening throughout the majority of our stay the question that few have answered is how exactly Andiron ups-the-ante compared to the likes of nearby Flemming's or even Echo & Rig, the former obviously a chain with similar price structure as well as execution while the latter is seriously flawed in its dessert program, though ringing in at 2/3 the cost for a similar upscale experience, plus in-house butchery and curing programs allowing for far more range.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xeRxFWCJZSpXArzm28RsRg"}

Certainly offering something a little different, with high quality ingredients readily apparent, it will require a few tweaks to make Ribs & Burgers really 'work,' but if these things can get dialed in I've no doubt the concept could succeed in several large markets nationwide.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CB6WrK7wvzm4j0MZSOl9-g"}

the fish in particular perhaps the best of its kind with boozy cherries finding a deft dance partner in charred white flesh.\n\nUnwilling and unable to forgo sweets, particularly at a place so routinely celebrated for its pastry program, it was with some restraint that I avoided requesting 'the lot,' but still investing heavily in 4/6 of the selections one would be hard pressed to name a single plate that failed to shine, even the seemingly overwrought sundae presenting a lovely blend of textures and flavors with more than enough to share while both the crostata and pumpkin cake were unassuming yet perfect, the heavy hitting S'mores bar a dish best shared, though so compelling as a result of the combination of honey, caramel, and chocolate that none will be left on the plate regardless of stomach capacity or party size.\n\nAlready functioning at a high level, and seemingly willing to take *some* chances without going 'all in,' Searsucker enters a market crowded with several similar restaurants and with longtime Las Vegas Chef Labadie at the helm an early look gives one hope that this won't just be another absentee landlord hotspot for pre-and-post-club noshing, a decision likely to be made by the powers that be in upcoming months as feedback and finances curate the cuisine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XbnnsZKL8AohGRzo1dCFCQ"}

the chicken sent in place of requested eggplant, while a side of meatballs was instead served as the spaghetti centered entr\u00e9e with a whole lot of watery noodles eventually going to waste.\n\nBeginning with breakfast, a few cups of coffee as well as orange juice, milk, plus a cocktail all brought along with water with refills rarely requiring a request, course one saw four plates delivered and while the flaccid pancakes with a simple spread of nutella could have benefitted from a bit more imagination both the chicken and waffles beneath peppery sausage gravy and the challah French Toast were as good as any served within a local diner, the use of 100% pure maple syrup a definite highlight, as was the quality of house-made corned beef acting to anchor a hash that featured golden-brown potatoes and lightly seared red peppers alongside a pair of poached eggs.\n\nDesignating round two as 'the sandwich course,' it was on the advice of EatingLV that 'the city's best Cuban' was ordered, and served with fries on a silver tray one would be hard pressed to argue with such an assessment, particularly as relates to authenticity, as each ingredient melded nicely between layers of toasty pressed bread, the 'Monte Cristo' equally tasty and loaded with ham despite missing an opportunity to be the only deep-fried version currently offered in Sin City while the 'Carolina' pulled pork was unfortunately quite dreadful, a total lack of vinegar in either the pig or the slaw not at all resembling the stuff served in the Southeast while the bun was a soggy mess mere seconds after arrival.\n\nReceiving repeat apologies for a delay that stretched just under forty minutes at the midpoint of the meal, it was almost as though the extra time only served to confuse the kitchen since the aforementioned mistakes were sent out despite being correctly listed on the ticket, but thankfully not meeting any harboring a distaste for animal flesh as the enormous chicken parmesan was an exceedingly high quality rendition with light breading and good sauce while meatballs were unfortunately a bit dry and almost entirely devoid of spice, the pot pie undoubtedly proving a far more worthwhile bite as golden puff pastry formed a buttery dome over a creamy potage chockablock full of chicken and vegetables that outdid many more expensive versions found elsewhere in Sin City.\n\nNot yet dialing in the dessert menu, and as such unable to offer the Strawberry Ice Box Pie while also admitting that breakfast pastries are currently brought in from an outside source, the meal conclude with a duo of Bread Pudding and Turtle Pie, the former a dense block of brioche swimming in bourbon infused sauce beneath slowly melting ice cream while the later was an absolute must-order for those fancying caramel or chocolate, the filling a spot-on rendition of the inspirational candy with a graham cracker crust crisp too the tooth and heavy with spice.\n\nAlready rivaling anything downtown for 24-hour fare, and only likely to get better with time, Siegel's 1941 is the sort of retro-rebrand that places such Roxy's at the Stratosphere have long aspired to emulate -

Inspired. Eats.\"\n\nPart passion project, but also a choice made to assure more flexibility for a man with a wife and kids, craftKITCHEN fills a strip mall spot reimagined from a previous restaurant and with clean lines plus a subtle natural vibe imparted by cooking quotes and plantlife the experience starts with warm welcomes at the door, a 7 o'clock arrival finding the youthful team still stocking shelves as light tunes from local radio chimed overhead.\n\nImmediately attuned to no less than two-dozen pastries, each crafted by Jaret starting at 2am with baking extending late into the day, it was admittedly having e-mailed to discuss the concept as well as the possibility of a 'small plates' sort of tasting that my arrival was expected, and although the Chef admitted some fatigue following a late night Grand Opening with friends and family neither he nor his staff could have been more accommodating, a total of eight demi-portions sampled with rarely a miss in quality or execution.\n\nTaking time to do things right, everything from produce to coffee sourced as locally as one can, those who love the later will be happy to know beans are sourced from Colorado River Roasters and with each cup brewed to order the fruit flavors are robust with a smooth finish, each sip good on its own though all thebetter when paired to breakfast pastries offered warmed-to-order, each of four sampled far less sweet than others in the area with the moist pumpkin muffin particularly impressive while the kouign amann was slightly softened as a result of housemade mixed berry filling.\n\nAllowed to select the menu, but taking input from the team as to which items were best, plates were rolled out mostly in pairs from the kitchen and starting light with well-timed progression round one consisted of a well-composed salad featuring creamy burrata set against pomegranate with an alternative plate as delicious as it was different, the toothsome oats perfectly cooked beneath a crackling caramelized top with an optional mix-in of dried fruit and nuts.\n\nAgain showing the palate of a chef willing to present his sweeter side with nuance as opposed to a sledgehammer of sugar, it was in silver-dollar flapjacks tinged in cocoa that tastebuds were next entrusted and, although better than the majority, the omnipresent plate seemed a bit too 'safe' to be worth too much stomach space, particularly when compared to juicy fried chicken atop crisp waffles kicked up by pickled peppers, let alone a Shepherd's Pie replacing lamb with spicy chorizo that you won't find anywhere else in town.\n\nNot entirely sold on avocado toast, but willing to trust the chef that the ingredient was put to equally good use on the pulled turkey benedict, those looking for something 'different' would be well served to check out the brined breast atop an English muffin with a sidecar of lemony hollandaise while a taste even more savory can be sought in the short rib hash with pan seared spuds, peppers, and onions.\n\nOverestimating my hunger when presenting the meal's final savory, a whole ham and cheese sandwich with creamy Bechamel pressed between slices of housemade panini bread, the somewhat atypical croque was nonetheless every bit as good as the sum of its ingredients and taking half home along with a box of baked goods it was approximately six hours later when the tasting continued, the oatmeal cookie with fruits similar to that of the bruleed version a particular standout as was the fluffy gluten-free brownie, apple tart, and carrot bar that ratcheted up the experience with tangy cream cheese frosting anchoring candy 'leaves' and buttery toffee shards.\n\n*****One-upping eat. in ingredient quality and out-thinking MTO Cafe in terms of creativity and menu design it would be difficult to name anyone outside of publicUS offering such a bounty of great products seven days a week throughout breakfast and lunch, the 25-minute drive from Summerlin notwithstanding there is no doubt craftKITCHEN is well worth a look for locals and tourists with a car alike.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L_Y55Zx1o89v4Oit2iEj8g"}

Vodka\nSpaghetti Julian\nFettuccine con Funghi\nOff-Menu Meatballs\nLasagna Verde\nVeal Parmesan \nChicken Scarpariello\nCarrot Cake with Ginger Icing\nBananas Flambee\nRainbow Cookies\nLimoncello\n\nHaving watched Carbone open to gratuitous fanfare from more than a dozen writers and industry folks the New York import had knowingly comped, it was not until I was able to gather a group large enough to properly sample the pricy Aria restaurant that I hazard to make a reservation, the results of a nearly three-hour meal with six friends far less impressive than any of the 'media' will openly pronounce.\n\nNo doubt a splashy space, the original channeled for much of the lavish design and showy tableside service from Captains shining in red, Carbone is the brainchild of Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and famous for high prices for traditional \"red sauce\" classics the Las Vegas iteration raises the stakes even higher than the Manhattan original, a $64 Veal Parm and $75 Lasagna a mere tip of the iceberg on a menu with prices not displayed out front.\n\nClearly trying to evoke an dining environment rare to be found in Las Vegas in the year 2015, entrance to Carbone begins at a podium of smiling young faces in front of a painting of Christopher Walken and with Rat Pack classics playing a bit too loudly overhead those with reservations are quickly whisked through an elegant lounge to one of three large rooms, the center featuring circular enclaves and several large tables with a central chandelier that speaks volumes about the restaurants intentions and unrepentant opulence.\n\nChampioning the slogan \"every table deserves a captain,\" a concept is inherently flawed by tableside shows preventing him from appropriate steering the backstaff flow of traffic, it was nearly forty-five minutes holding enormous menus close like blankets that passed before orders were finally taken, and somehow avoiding to topple unused wine glasses while reaching for a complimentary selection of antipasti the first bites of the meal would actually prove to be some of the best and most interesting, the acid-splashed cauliflower simple yet refreshing while cured meat alongside three breads were all quite delicious, the saucy focaccia particularly quite addictive.\n\nBreaking the menu down into four-courses, though presentations of five plates requiring a show saw things slightly more staggered, round one included nine baked clams in 3x3 preparation alongside two steaks of foie gras amidst onions plus sauteed peppers and although the former proved a bit unwieldy for sharing while the liver was unctuous and well portioned, all attention was drawn to the tableside preparation of ZZ's Caesar's, a $42 double-order highlighted by the buttery croutons and sardines that was otherwise quite standard.\n\nTaking macaroni recommendations from a Public Relations executive and adding in personal preferences plus the anecdotal experience of others, course two featured four different pastas along with seven off-menu meatballs, only the $150 White Truffle Tagliatelle proving appropriately cooked al dente as thinner noodles bordered on 'mushy,' the meatballs no better or worse than would be expected for six dollars each...and certainly not enough to compensate for the uni-tinged Julian's great flavor being marred by such a failure in execution.\n\nOnward to entrees, the Chicken Scarpariello suggested by a local Italian restauanteur undoubtedly performing the best of any savory as spicy sausage provided a decadent nest for the juicy half-bird, those enticed by the famous fried Veal Chop will be happy to know that the $64 tab is mostly justified by both size and virtually perfect execution, the same not to be said of a $75 loaf of lasagna far too heavy handed with green peppers beneath a top that was actually too bitter to be enjoyable as a result of being burned.\n\nEnjoying the company and conversation far more than the food as the clock inched toward ten it was finally with the dessert cart parked tableside that a concluding duo was selected and treated to fudgey Rainbow Cookies and complimentary Limoncello as we watched bananas flambeed tableside it was with good fortune that both the boozy fruit over ice cteam and curl of carrot cake succeeded where other plates had failed, each textbook in execution and large enough to share at comparative bargain of just fifteen dollars.\n\n** Admittedly early in its Las Vegas lifespan and no doubt a place that will drum up tourist dollars and praise from the press to whom prices and service are tilted to please, Carbone offers a unique dinning experience compared to anything else currently on The Strip, yet failing in several basics of execution from kitchen to captain it simply is not nearly as great as it currently seems to believe.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_44__hQ4GxGNRzkhLHBw0A"}
