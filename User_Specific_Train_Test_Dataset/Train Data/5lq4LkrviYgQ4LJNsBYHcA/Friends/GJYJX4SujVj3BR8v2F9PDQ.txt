It's huge. It's sound system could drown out a launching rocket. You'll move to it because you can't help it beats rattling you from the inside out. Looking around everyone is ecstatic. It's 5am and a thousand people push on the insides of this sound box. The sounds emanating from the booth are deep and soulful. When the bass drops you realize that the pilgrimage to hear co-owner/DJ David Morales' SIX HOUR SET was worth the drive, $25 entry fee and hours queuing in a wicked blizzard. \n\nSurvival Kit:\near plugs (the system is tight, but deafening)\npocket hand warmers (it's freakin' frigid in the winter)\nsneakers (you came here to dance, people)\nbaby powder (for those sliding moves)\nwaist belt (for cash/ID. you won't want to lug a purse)\ngum or tea tree oil toothpicks (someone on e will be thankful)\nan Emergen-C (a little pick-me-up)\na hanky (for mopping up buckets of sweat)\na thong (hey, you never know if you'll wake up at home)\n\nHowever the main room was torched last month and has yet to reopen. In the meantime the adjacent Stereobar is still pumping out beats. If you left when the bars closed in Boston there's a chance the party would still be going on. It's got a terrace lovely for the summertime, and while it lacks the shock absorbers under the dance floor like its big brother, the vibe is intimate and chill. \n\nGo get your groove on.\n\n----------------\n\nOld school homies, a little love to y'all:\n\nIn the beginning there was Jack\nand Jack had a groove. \nAnd from this groove came the groove of all grooves.\nAnd one day while viciously throwing down in his box\nJack boldly declared \nLET THERE BE HOUSE\nand house music was born.\n\n\"Can You Feel It\" - Mr. Fingers", "type": "review", "business_id": "BSN7or2JJyk23S38_rorYA"}
