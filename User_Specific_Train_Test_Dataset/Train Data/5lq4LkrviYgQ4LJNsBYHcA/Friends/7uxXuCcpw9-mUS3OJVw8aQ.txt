Libraries are so often forgotten, but they can be such a pertinent and invaluable resource for a community. I re-discovered my love of the library at Mount Lebanon Public Library this past weekend.\n\nMy mom and I dashed in here to escape the cold and to drop off her autobiography. As soon as we entered - we were greeted by two lovely older volunteers who were heading up a non-profit book program - in which they re-sell donated books. Their selection was phenomenal. They had everything categorized perfectly - from fiction, to non-fiction, self-help books, art books, recipe books, memoirs and much more. The best part was that everything was in near perfect condition and they were all priced anywhere between a dollar - to two dollars.\n\nI sat for nearly an hour  - perusing through recipe books and memoirs and ended up purchasing about 6 books for about a dollar fifty each. Each book was easily worth at least 15-20 dollars each and each piece of literature was something that I would definitely have purchased if I happened to come across it at a bookstore.\n\nIf you live in the area - support your local library and let it support you.\n\nTrust.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KZlFb1qDi8YSZJH2A2Nn3A"}

The music, both live and from the jukebox, was entertaining, but what really set this bar apart from any bar I've been to -  was its faithful following of its frightful theme. \n\nStaring around me at the assortment of people around me, my lungs slightly sore from belting out to Rock Band, my eyes itching from my brother's cigarette smoke, and my hands cold from my bottomless mug of water (which the bartender was on point at continuing to refill) - I couldn't help but sigh in perfect contentment.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AJL0RCaSSA1NBay-XJ1pJw"}

It's the perfect place to clear your pores and sweat out any vodka and redbulls injested the night before.  Lying back on the wooden benches, you feel your body become lifeless, as your forehead heats up. Once throughly warmed - you head to the Arctic Room.\n\nThe Arctic Ice Room has heated floors and benches where you can sit perched as you watch snow fall before you. It's soothing, and magical, and takes you back to the excitement you felt when young. Utter awe at the early signs of resh falling winter.\n\nFeeling the chill, you emerge from the brisk world  - back into Qua reality  - an amazing shower with high quality shampoo and conditioner (Qua even has a handy contraption to get the water out of your bathing suit in a matter of seconds)\n\nFeeling alive, awake, and amazing  - you slather yourself in moisturizer, brush your hair, get dressed, and leave Qua a better and healthier person.\n\nIf you're going to Vegas - go big. \n\nGo to Qua to forget the craziness of the night before, and to get ready for the craziness that lies ahead.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-FCQ6tpsdpbeEJX8R_-tQQ"}

Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.\n\nAlso, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. \n\nWhen we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. \n\nI personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NL5fnkELhsdTTE6jjROvyw"}

It was full of fabulous sights, fabulous shows, fabulous people, fabulous food, and fabulous memories. And the Palazzo - brought much of this fabulousness to our virgin Vegas eyes with their....\n\nAmaz-abulous prices. I believe we got a special deal since the Palazzo is new - but for $185 total before tax  (imagine that split four ways!) a night, it accommodated the three Miss Yelps and our lovely guest - Kirk very comfortably.\n\nIt was conveniently located near the fabulous Wynn and Bellagio for easy giganticous buffet access.\n\nThere were lovel-abulous oppulent high lobby ceilings and fresh scents (a mixture of laundry and a clean musk) which circulate around the fabulous space. (the Casino may be an exception)\n\nWe adored the phenom-abulous concierge Angie, who was patient, helpful, and on-point with dinner recommendations (Okada was great!).\n\nWe couldn't get enough of the sweet-abulous door guys who remembered our face as we came and went and made us feel like we were coming back \"home\" - after a long night of fabulous partying.\n\nWe couldn't stop raving about the spacious swank rooms with three fabulous flat screens (there's even one in the bathroom!), two big queen plush beds, a living room area complete with decadent chaisses for scandalous photo-ops, soft thick cotton robes, a plethora of closet and drawer space, a killer bathroom with great makeup lighting, fresh scented toiletries, a big tub to soak worn feet, and a separate toilet area within the bathroom - made for group living.\n\nBig props to our friendl-abulous black jack dealer that gave us the low-down on Jay-Z and Karaoke spots, while he dealt us (ie: Connie) winning hands.\n\nWho can forget the fun-abulous low-key crowd of hotel patrons here, who could care less and even celebrated my Las Vegas Ugg wearing fabulousness.\n\nAnd above all - today when I remembered that I'd left all of my fabulous undergarments in my fabulous Palazzo room, their lost and found rep - took down all of my information, promised to give me an update, and said they'd ship everything back to me - free of charge.\n\nUh can you say - FABULOUS!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5paMI5Hhciyl09yGpzdoJw"}

They've added stretch to them, made them short and bootylicious, and injected some 'tude into them. Mark, the guy helping us at this specific Miss Sixty was extremely personable, helpful, and outgoing. He went out of his way to check in with each of us to see if we were interested in trying stuff on, and recommended that we check out the Miss Sixty outlet nearby, and extended his family and friends discount to us.\n\nUnfortunately the cute pair of booty-alls that I tried on, were far too expensive for me and due to length, I could probably only wear them in Vegas, but it's reassuring to know, as an overalls collector - that there's a fashion line just as excited about straps attached to pants as I am.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QVw4Igc37xoOXh1lNPl3iA"}

It was creamy and rich with flavor. My salmon tagine was exceptional. It was made in a clay pot and the salmon was tender and soaked up the tagine sauce nicely. There was a great array of accompanying vegetables and the rice - though small in portion was spiced and melted in the mouth.\n\nLeading up to our meal - we could see their chef preparing everything with precision and care. Everything was made there and on the spot - and though it can be a little slow at times - it's because the food is fresh and not re-heated.\n\nMy mom and I were tempted to order dessert, but being that we were under a tight schedule - we thanked their kind chef and efficient waitress and headed back into the Mount Lebanon cold.\n\nKous Kous is definitely worth trying. The number of other dishes that I saw being put together while we waited for ours' all looked delicious and were presented beautifully.\n\nTrust.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-XN4Oi0UCBK7rE3MsSXdqw"}
