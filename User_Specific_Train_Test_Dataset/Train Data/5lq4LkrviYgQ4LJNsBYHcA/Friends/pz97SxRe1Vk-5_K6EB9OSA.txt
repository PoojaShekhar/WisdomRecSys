This place is located below Ichiza in the same plaza, a little hidden, but worth it if you want some Hong Kong stye Cantonese food.\n\nWe went for breakfast so ended up ordering the jook (rice porridge), some gon chao ngau hor (flat noodles with beef and bean sprouts), fried tofu for the young man and some Cantonese style sui gao (dumplings). \n\nThe gon chao ngau hor smelled wonderful and tasted pretty good. Only thing was it was super greasy. I think next time I'll have to tell them to go easy on the oil. The jook was really nice on a cold morning. Portions are much smaller here. The bowl of jook is about what you'd get when you go to dim sum, not when you go to a restaurant that has jook on the menu. \n\nThe sui gao weren't bad at all -- I mean it's not like what you'll get in HK but since I can't just hop on a plane every time I'm craving something like this, I'll just have to make do.\n\nI noticed that everything in Vegas is a buck or two more than in Orange County, but the fact that you can get Cantonese food like this alone in Vegas means just pay up and shut up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ"}

Those of you who know me know I would not choose to eat buffet. However, when your child tells you that he would really like to have breakfast buffet before we leave Vegas, you try to comply. \n\nSo it was 10am and I called around to see which places were still serving breakfast buffet. I wasn't gonna go to the Bellagio because I only eat a few items and it's hardly worth it for me to spend $20-$30 bucks to eat bacon, sausage, peel and eat shrimp and maybe 2 pieces of toast.\n\nI was told that this place was serving brunch and even as we were driving there, I'm hearing 'I had dinner buffet here once when I was wasted and I thought it sucked\". Everything in my body should've told me to STOP and not go there, but, we went anyway.\n\nThe brunch buffet on weekends is $10.99 for adults and $8.99 for kids between 4 and 10 years of age. If you get their players card it's $2 less, so that's what I did. I went to get the players card and we ended up paying $8.99/adult and $6.99/kid.\n\nI wasn't hopeful at all. In fact, I had such low expectations that I was actually pleasantly surprised! The buffet was clean and laid out spaciously. The place just looked neat and tidy (unlike the Orleans' French Market Buffet which I now have to knock down a star after coming here).\n\nThe sausages were very tasty (unlike those at Orleans) and the bacon cooked perfectly. The young man and I started with that. They have an egg station where omelettes and fried eggs are cooked to order. When I ventured further, I was really happy to see that they had peel and eat shrimp as well and they were far better (fresher!) than that at the Orleans. The cocktail sauce here was also a hell lot tastier!\n\nI ended up trying the bratwurst with sauerkraut -- really good even though it didn't look as good as it tasted. I even tried the menudo -- bleh, tasted like water, no flavor at all. I liked that they had both grits and cream of wheat although the grits were too clumpy and thick to my taste. \n\nThere was a ham carving station, Mexican food comprising of beans, rice, tortillas, toppings (killer spicy grilled jalapenos), hash browns were nicely cooked -- crunchy on top and soft under. The food was regularly replaced so it didn't have that messed up look about them. That is my biggest issue with buffets, when the trays of food look like they'd been tampered with. \n\nI was highly impressed that they lifted out the trays of food, cleaned out the sides and replaced the trays -- and did this often enough so everything looked really clean.\n\nBy the time we were done, they were firing up the grill for hamburgers, which were made to order! Too bad we were too full to try one. They also had desserts and ice cream, but no, I didn't try any of that either.\n\nThe weekend brunch also offers you champagne, but I'd be a bit wary drinking champagne at a brunch that costs you less than $10. However, if you're like me and don't really dig the myriad items they lay out at high end buffets, then perhaps, this is the right place for you! I know that next time, I will not raise my nose in the air and look down upon these cheap buffets because this one really exceeded my expectations. But then again, considering the only foods I eat at buffets, maybe it's not really having expectations at all!\n\nFor the price, I thought it was pretty damn good! And don't get upset with me for giving them 4 stars. I'm not comparing this place to your high-end buffets! In its own class of buffets, I'd say this is pretty good! Far better than the Orleans buffet lunch which was $7.50 -- but their shrimp wasn't as fresh and their cocktail sauce nowhere near as good as the one at Palace Station!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TKE1cyjs9q2PoqMXqEV9Eg"}

I don't know what it is. This time, even though it was good, it just didn't blow me away like last time. So one star off.\n---------------------------------\n\nTHANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. That was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. I wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. Man, it was bustling! Turns out they were open until 3am Mon-Sat, until 2.30am on Sundays. However, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.\n\nSo there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. Lil guy was all for it. So, counter it was. I was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. There were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. They were obviously having a good time.\n\nWe were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. Hubby left the ordering to me. I ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). Then, I proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.\n\nUni pon ($5.50) arrived first. It was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. OMG it was fantastic. The uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. I could've eaten 3 of these.\n\nThen came the salmon skin salad ($5). This was no ordinary salmon skin salad. This was the emperor of all salmon skin salads I've ever had. Crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. Hubby and I shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel. \n\nTaramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something I've been craving since leaving Hawaii. I used to eat it at least once a week. After a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. The taramiso did not disappoint. In fact, it was so perfect hubby and I again commented on how much we've missed this dish.\n\nAll the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable DVD player oblivious of all the ongoings around him. \n\nTofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. Romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. The grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.\n\nOf course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. We had 2 large bottles of Asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). I'm sorry, but Santouka Ramen does not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. The broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. The chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. It looked like pancetta. Hubby was a bit skeptical but I assured him he would like it, and guess what? He did.\n\nThis is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas, and let me tell you this, I'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, I'm not eating the food as I'm writing this.

We went to get take-out to bring to eat with others so I'm basing the service and food on the experience I had from that. First of all, there's nothing 'express' about this place. It's a sit-down restaurant, not a 'scoop food' place. There is also a location inside the Palace Station hotel.\n\nWe arrived and the staff were very helpful. We ordered a bunch of dishes and were told to take a seat while they prepared it for us. The man even offered us tea while we waited and then chatted with me in Cantonese. I thought they were extremely friendly (but again, it might be because I spoke their language). Throughout the whole time of waiting for our food, all the staff stopped by to chat with me.\n\nSo take into consideration that it was about 20-30 mins from the time the food was cooked to the time it was consumed.....\n\nBeef and broccoli (okay, not my choice) -- was really flavorful, the beef was tender and the broccoli was fresh and not overcooked.\n\nShrimp fried rice (once again, not my choice) -- not bad for fried rice although as a Chinese, we don't really like only shrimp in our fried rice. We like a bunch of stuff.... but it was good.\n\nGarlic gai lan -- nice garlicky taste -- they didn't skimp on the garlic! \n\nSalt & Pepper pork chops -- these were very tasty even after sitting in the take out box for 20-30 mins. In fact, these were so popular the people who ordered the shrimp fried rice and beef broccoli ended up eating most of this! *grrrrrrrrrrrrrr*\n\nBraised tofu -- also done very nicely with stalks of choy sum and dried shiitake mushrooms. \n\nI thought everything was really tasty and wished we had dined in instead. This place is definitely staying on my list of places to return to on subsequent trips when craving Cantonese style Chinese food.\n\nWasn't too pricey either. For all of that including steamed rice was $40 (tip not included).\n\n4.5 stars!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "pj0vl4DIlDCChe80Df40Yw"}

The wrapper was mushy and soggy, most probably overcooked! the filling wasn't tasty either with bits of gristle which I had to spit out. Don't order this!\n\nBitter melon with beef -- really flavorful! the beef was tender with generous portions of bitter melon\n\nPei Pah tofu -- a lot of places don't do this dish because it's a lot of work. this dish consists of mashed tofu with bits of shrimp and sometimes with scallions although this one didn't. I didn't think the tofu was as flavorful as it could've been, but still very nice, served atop a bed of garlic spinach.\n\nGai lan with oyster sauce -- all prime gai lan bits, very tender and perfectly cooked!\n\nI liked everything except for the won tons. I would come back again for the regular dishes, not the won tons. The only complaint is that the food is on the greasy side.

Then, we decided to walk over to the brewery because they also serve ribs, but we got there at 10:03pm and they close at 10pm.\n\nHubby had been driving and driving around like he usually does and couldn't make up his mind where we should eat.

We didn't manage to eat here on our last trip, so this time around, we decided to try and get in there on our first night in Vegas. We didn't make a reservation and it was around 7.30pm when we got there. Even though it was a Monday night, they looked pretty packed, but then again, where isn't it packed in Vegas every single night of the week?\n\nLuckily they had a table for us. Before we even ordered, a plate of complimentary appetizers were placed on the table... olives, toasted slices of baguette and some balls of either cheese or flavored butter - I couldn't tell what it was really.\n\nHubby ordered sangria ($6). ACK, it was awful and tasted like they used cheap wine in it. I stuck with iced tea. After we ordered, the food arrived rather quickly. Boquerones ($5) on toast was okay. The marinated anchovies weren't the best I'd ever had, but we hadn't had boquerones for a long time now so we really felt like some. Really awesome bocquerones has no trace of fishiness, but these ones did have a slight fishy taste to it.\n\nFried calamari was also okay. It was pretty good although again a little too much batter to my liking. But it wasn't rubbery so that was a plus. The camarones al ajillo was not bad, but hubby said I could've easily made that dish at home so it wasn't anything which blew him away.\n\nThe duck rolls with hoisin sauce were pretty disgusting in my book. The rolls were like egg rolls but stuffed with duck. It had WAY too much hoisin sauce making them just TOO TOO sweet. It actually made my mouth pucker from just one bite. I did not like these at all. \n\nThe last tapa we ordered were the lamb chops which were served with a red wine reduction. This was clearly the star of the evening. Perfectly grilled with the sauce enhancing the lamb chops instead of throwing the entire dish off like the hoisin sauce on the duck rolls. It was served on a very flavorful bed of lentils, zucchini spaghetti strands and artichokes. I would definitely order this dish again.\n\n5 tapa, 1 glass of sangria, an iced tea and one lemonade came to slightly under $55 before tip. Kinda pricey if you ask me. Service was okay, nothing to write home about. Now that I've eaten here, I don't think I'll come back again on a future trip. There are just way too many great restaurants in Vegas to return to Firefly. Food was mediocre, but I think if you are in Vegas partying, this place has great atmosphere and is good for downing alcohol and having a small bite to eat. However, we aren't the partying type even if lil guy wasn't in tow. All we want is awesome food at reasonable prices (or even awesome food at not so reasonable prices) and Firefly certainly doesn't fall into that category.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

They were quite empty when we were there so I was a little perplexed since it got rather good reviews on yelp.\n\nThe menu was large. Like in pretty damn big. We got some appetizers like soft shelled crabs, agedashi tofu, a few different types of sushi to try. I noticed they had tako-wasa, one of my favorite things to eat with beer, so we got that too. It wasn't bad. Actually none of the above items were bad.\n\nAfter grazing on appetizers we were debating whether to eat ramen here or move elsewhere. Hubby searched the reviews via cell and said that people liked the ramen. This is when we decided to order the pork bone ramen with extra chashu.\n\nWhen the bowl arrived, the steam indicated it was piping hot. I was excited. I took a sip of the broth, then another. I then moved the bowl over to hubby and asked him to taste the broth since he's pretty accepting of food -- much more than I.\n\nHe took a sip, then looked at me. Took another, then said \"it's watery\". My sentiments exactly. It was watery, flavorless and really subpar. But we didn't want to waste it, so I ate a few bites and my hubby bless his heart, ate the rest.\n\nFor a pork bone soup base, it failed miserably. There was no depth at all. Unlike some people, I thought the ramen at Ichiza was 100x better, unfortunately, Ichiza runs out of their broth really quickly so if you go later in the day they won't have any ramen left. I was so disappointed because I was craving ramen and didn't get to satiate that craving in the end.

Purple is just not a very nice color for big security guys.\n\nThe other thing I didn' t like about Wynn was how the valet drop off and pick up are kind of far away from each other. Yes there is an airconditioned room for you to wait in but when there are 20+ people standing around, the room just doesn't get cold anymore. Even with the misters, it was hot.

Now this I just had to see.\n\nI wanted to see what the attraction was all about, but when we got there it looked like any hotel you'd find on the old strip, just less sleazy and less ghetto.

I stopped and asked a security guy where they were serving breakfast and he pointed us upstairs.

The breakfast buffet was amazing for only 5 bucks. There was a station where you can have custom made omelettes and waffles. Here's a run down on what else was available: pancakes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, corned beef hash, chicken fried steak, hash browns, fresh fruit salad, a bunch of canned fruits, cottage cheese, cream of wheat, oatmeal, and some other stuff I don't remember.\n\nI ordered a veggie omelet and they even had jalepenos which gave it such a nice little kick.

So we've been coming to Vegas a lot this year and basically, this is a place we return to time after time again. If you've lost all your money gambling, or have spent WAY too much eating on the strip, then this place will feed you for mere pennies.\n\nThe $4.95 10oz sirloin steak dinner is not available any longer. That is such a bummer. In its place is the filet mignon dinner for $6.99 and comes with the same stuff as the sirloin dinner did: soup OR salad, a side of veggies and your choice of baked potato, fries or rice pilaf. It's still a fantastic deal, but I must say, I much prefer the sirloin over the mignon. Filet mignon is just not a cut I usually like because it lacks flavor IMO.\n\nFor breakfast, you can get the steak and eggs special which is now still under 4 bucks and that piece of steak is a NY strip. This is a delicious alternative to the $6.99 steak dinner option if you like that cut of meat.\n\nGone are also the buck 99 breakfast specials. I'm guessing that the cheapo meals they were dishing out were losing them money and now, they've had to raise their prices a few bucks in order for them to make a profit. However, the pancake breakfast special at $4.99 comes with 2 huge pancakes, 2 eggs and your choice of bacon or sausage (which used to be around a buck 99). A side of bacon or sausage is still $1.99 which is cheap compared to other places which charges about 4 bucks for the same thing.\n\nIt's still one of the best bargains in Vegas. If you don't get a drink it will keep your costs way under for a meal which is going to not only be satisfying, but will make you wonder why in the hell they charge so much on the strip for the same stuff.\n\nThese days when I go to Ellis Island for my steaks I bring my portable sea salt dispenser with me. They don't season their steaks and all they have is table salt or A1 steak sauce. These steaks are good enough to eat with just a sprinkle of salt, but don't ruin them with plain ole table salt!!! The meat here was far better in quality when served rare than the kobe beef tataki I had at Shibuya where I paid an arm and a leg for my meal. Go figure!!\n\nPS: Now that the mignon is a far thicker cut than the sirloin ever was, make sure you order it more well done than you like. My medium came out rare, but it's a hit and miss because the one I had yesterday was done just right (yes....

I'm usually a huge fan of the Westin and although this particular location isn't as nice as the majority of them worldwide, it still has all the fixings which I love about the Westin.\n\nCheck in was a breeze and friendly. It didn't take much time at all before we were all headed up to our room. I like the fact that this was a smaller hotel and that we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. The other redeeming factor was that it didn't smell like smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casino area, but since it's so small, you don't have a host of people hanging out anyway.\n\nBetween 5 and 7pm, there is a complimentary happy hour for all guests. You can go down to Suede restaurant and enjoy wine, beer, snacks -- all unlimited -- for 2 hrs. We went down and got some fruit, cheese, chips and they had some pretty tasty wine available as well as various beers and soft drinks.\n\nLater, we were making tea in our room and ran out of tea bags, cups and water (they give you Nestle bottled water for free to make tea and coffee with) so we called housekeeping and within 5 mins they had brought us some more.\n\nThe Heavenly bed is out of this world -- I just dozed off in the middle of the afternoon enveloped in its comfort. The shower is another plus with its signature 2 shower heads.\n\nWe did have a problem with the AC as it wouldn't register any lower than 72 degrees. I had set it to 65 degrees before we left to go out for dinner and when we returned, it was the same temp. So I again called downstairs and they sent an engineer within 5 minutes. He brought us a bar of chocolate -- how awesome is that?\n\nHe changed the filter and fixed the problem and was out the door in less than 10 mins. The room remained cool for the whole night. \n\nSo for me, this was an awesome experience. The service was out of this world. My previous experiences with other hotels is that you can call them, but they won't arrive for at least 15-20mins. I would definitely come back again the next time we visit Vegas. I'm done with all those kitschy flashy hotels.\n\nOh, and winning money at the casino was another huge plus!!\n\n4.5 stars!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bQXzuRIQNKGxe0Py-CLDYA"}

The gals behind the counter were so cool, they gave us some to eat without charging us.\n\nOur total was only $10. I'm guessing if you go early in the day you'll have more selection. We got there in the mid-afternoon.\n\nI liked most of the items, but the dark chocolate canolis were really quite sweet. The filling was interesting, had some fragrant addition to it and it wasn't whipped cream but rather, a creamy filling.

I ordered lomo saltado, something I thoroughly enjoyed before and did not disappoint this time either. I remembered it being served with potatoes but asked for them to be omitted. Extremely flavorful with onions and tomatoes though the cut of beef used was not as good as IG, but it was also 5 bucks cheaper.\n\nI was very curious the first time trying Peruvian food how it reminded me of Chinese food but now after researching  I realized that there is a HUGE Chinese presence in Peru which is reflected in the cuisine. One of the famous Peruvian dishes is chaufa which is their version of fried rice. We did not order that though.\n\nThe other dish we had was Aji Pollo which was like a very mild chicken curry. With the miracle green sauce which makes everything taste great, it was pretty good although the texture was a bit weird. But like lil guy said the green sauce wasn't as flavorful nor was it as spicy as the one at Inka Grill.\n\nRun by a Peruvian family, the son takes the order and serves while mom and other family members are in the kitchen preparing.

However, I'm basing it on the entire experience and here's how it went.\n\nWe arrived well after the 3pm check in time. My friend had requested an upgrade for me but the gal who checked me in didn't mention it at all, nor did she say 'sorry we can't offer it to you' or anything to that effect. Just no mention. She did however mention the fact that it was our 10 yr anniversary and said she was giving us a bottle of complimentary champagne. Oh well, better than nothing right?\n\nSo we go up to the room and guess what? Housekeeping was IN the room cleaning up. I was super pissed now. I was exhausted and really just wanted to relax, but instead, I went back downstairs and had the gal give me another room. \n\nOK, so back up again and I called my friend who requested an upgrade for us and he informed me that he had arranged for the upgrade to a suite and for me to call back down to the front desk. So I called and found out that the suites only had one bed and we needed two, so we decided to just decline the offer and stay where we were.\n\nAbout an hour in the room, we get a call from the front desk asking us if we were going to upgrade. Hubby was like \"WTF? Don't they communicate amongst each other?\". We had to tell them NO. Believe it or not, after a few more hours, some housekeeping manager comes to our room, knocks and then opens our door. When she saw us inside she was taken aback and then asked us \"you're leaving tonight right?\" I was like \"NO, we JUST checked in today\".\n\nSo I was really annoyed with this whole check-in process and even more so by the fact that they were all clueless. We did eventually get our complimentary champagne, but we weren't in the room and it was left outside when we returned later that night. Wasn't anything special -- something we'd never heard of .... we never drank it, brought it home still unopen.\n\nNow to the room itself. I liked the large plasma tv in the room which accommodated our Wii. There is a mount for your iPod which is nice if you brought your's along. Bathrooms were much smaller than other hotels, but it was alright.... I don't spend a lot of time in there so it doesn't really matter to me. The beds were very comfortable and they had the nice quilt blankets which I like. I hate those polyester blankets with a passion and I don't stay in hotels which have those if I can help it.\n\nThere is a mini bar in the room but don't touch it at all costs. The gal told me at check in that it's weight sensored and if you touch it you'll be charged. Hubby looked at the menu -- $4 for a can of diet coke, $71 for the Hennessey and mind you, it's the little teenie bottle -- SHUDDUP! RIGHT?\n\nThe hotel itself shows its age. The young man said it felt \"Hawaiian-ish\" in the lobby which I guess is true. The casino was really boring. I spent 2 nights in there on the slots but since this is an older hotel, the casino itself isn't very big so everything is jam packed into this small space. I got bored pretty quickly, and even though I spent  2 nights there, it was only for a few hours\n\nOn our last night I called down to see if they could offer us an extra night at the same rate. The woman who picked up the phone was very curt and sounded impatient. She said \"this is our rate\" and that's that. I thought it was interesting how at a time like this, when occupancy rate is down and the entire economy of the country is in such shambles, that they'd rather have an empty room than fill it, and also, the display of such bad customer service is laughable.\n\nThe only thing I liked about this hotel was the room, but then hubby thought it was smaller than the other hotels we've stayed at on the strip but gives off the illusion that it was larger due to furniture placement. For me, I was more appalled at the customer service from check in to check out (which thankfully we did over the tv so I didn't have to deal with another moronic staff member) rather than the room itself. \n\nFor the same price, you can get better service and better all around on the strip than the Mirage.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DUdBbrvqfaqUe9GYKmYNtA"}

The person on the other hand (JANICE) said: \"there is a piping problem and they're fixing it, have a nice day\" and hung up on me. I couldn't believe it.

The room was very nice with those thick comforters that I like. The beds were comfortable although slightly too soft for hubby. Although check in was kinda slow, she did comply to all my requests of wanting a non-smoking room as well as one located closer to the elevator. I do not like those rooms where you have to walk a marathon to get to.\n\nThe valet parking is pretty efficient also. The valets are very friendly and will help you with directions. In fact, they always ask you if you need directions to get some where. Our only problem was asking them to recommend places to go to -- which, most of the time, they would give us some weird place which we wouldn't even go to in California. Oh well.\n\nThe casino is also well ventilated, although you can still smell the smoke. I guess that's inevitable.

No omakase was offered but they had a tasting menu for $130. Lil guy had udon with vegetables, agedashi tofu ($7) and an order of edamame ($5).\n\nFirst course: trio of 2 slices of toro drizzled with a yuzu soy sauce; tuna tartare with yuzu and avocado; toro tartare stack with beluga caviar and gold flakes. I was impressed with how my meal started. Everything on this plate tasted great and was beautifully presented although both the tartares kind of stuck to the plate when I tried to pick it up with my chopsticks and I ended up having to scrape it off with my chopsticks.\n\nSecond course (although it should really be the 4th): duo of hamachi and kanpachi. The former consisted of a garlic soy yuzu sauce while the latter was sitting in a marinade of black truffle oil and yuzu. Again both were rather pleasing to the palate.\n\nThird course (or is it the 6th now): beef tataki of thinly sliced Kobe beef drizzled with a soy sauce infused with garlic. Paper thin slivers of fried garlic on each slice of beef were accompanied with daikon sprouts. I didn't like the taste of the beef. It just didn't taste like how raw Kobe beef should taste - strong and rather off putting. The heavy sauce managed to mask the unpleasantness of the beef and the fried garlic helped immensely so it was still palatable in the end.\n\nSatay lobster in uni butter sauce as this dish was present also came with one large scallop - slightly overcooked so it was a tad chewy. I didn't think the satay complemented the dish at all. In fact, it overpowered the delicate flavor of uni and ended up making this dish mediocre at best. \n\nBeef short rib arrived very artistically presented. It included white asparagus, edamame, caramelized pearl onion and a small sliver of foie gras atop the beef. I loved the taste of the foie gras but the beef short rib was nothing special. It was no different than good galbijim and therefore didn't impress.\n\nI have no idea why they decided to add lobster to the miso soup because it did nothing for it. The miso soup itself was watery and unflavorful and the chunks of lobster meat was bland. It's hard to believe that a high end restaurant like this couldn't present a tastier version of something as simple as miso soup.\n\nThe final portion of the meal before dessert was the sushi. I thought it was excellent that they gave you fresh wasabi because it definitely enhances the sushi experience. However, I was extremely disappointed in the sushi itself. The rice was still on the al dente side and the fish was also not of superb quality. Maguro and salmon were okay - I've had far better elsewhere. The hirame (flounder) was surprisingly gristly. It was chewy and crunchy! Not very pleasant. I enjoyed the hamachi though, it was almost buttery in texture. I liked the ume which accompanied the sushi. This course was wonderfully presented (see photo).\n\nI was at the end of the meal portion and felt let down. It started off with a bang but slowly went downhill. How does this happen in an establishment such as this? Aren't the courses supposed to build into a crescendo until it explodes and then give the diner a sense of climax in the end?\n\nI guess the chef did somehow make it up with dessert because it was excellent. I being not a dessert fan had nothing but great things to say about the dessert trio which arrived. The rich chocolate ganache cake infused with sake was superb. The other two (names fail me) were also good. Both had something fruity in it so it wasn't heavy at all.\n\nIf I only had the first two courses and then the final dessert, I would've given them 5 stars. I thought service could've been better. They brought me a refill of iced tea ($3) once and then forgot about it. The courses also came out a tad too quickly, often before I'd even finished the previous course. \n\nFor a high-end establishment it was lacking both in service and the quality of food it was serving especially since I was paying $130 for the tasting menu. What truly rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that I ordered udon for the lil guy and the menu had shrimp tempura udon for $16. Since lil guy didn't eat shrimp I asked if they could do it with vegetables instead. The server told me sure they could but failed to inform me that I would be charged the same price. If I had known, I would've just ordered the shrimp tempura and ate it myself. In the end, I was charged $16 for plain udon with a few vegetables in it. When I questioned the server his response was \"it's not on the menu\". WTF??? This type of customer service is a reflection of poor management. Just because something is not on the menu doesn't mean you can't be flexible and offer a service to a customer when they ask for it. But after you offer that service you need to tell them that they would be charged the same amount and then let them make that decision.\n\nOrdinarily it would've been a 3 star rating but overall, they only get a 2.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bmNPNlCLDplWB55ic3Bixg"}

When I walked into the theater with lil guy, I was taken aback at the sheer size of this whole production. \n\nWe got pretty good seats -- eye level. I chose NOT to sit way up front due to previous experiences as I knew with any Cirque productions, you will have to stretch your neck up to view everything high up and miss a lot of things which were performed on an elevated stage. And I'm really glad I chose the seats I did because we got an excellent view.\n\nBefore the show started some cast members would interact with the audience which caused some hilarious moments. There was also one staged interaction which basically was a message to audience members not to smoke, use their cell or use flash photography during the performance. It was nicely executed.\n\nI'm not sure if I enjoyed KA as much as previous productions because I felt that the story line was really confusing (and it seems that other yelpers have found the same thing). Yes the acrobatic movements are quite impressive, but anyone who has seen the Chinese acrobats in action will know that this is really nothing exceptional. However, when you put that together with the music, the lights, the stage effects and the entire grandiose and elaborate production that KA is, I guess it's pretty damn amazing.\n\nI know hubby and lil guy (both Cirque du Soleil virgins) were both in awe of it all. Lil guy loved the pyro show at the end. His eyes were just wide open throughout the entire performance with intermittent glances over to me with a huge grin on his face. Just that alone was enough to bring him to another Cirque performance.\n\nOH and another thing.... you can buy drinks -- yes, alcoholic drinks -- and bring it into the theater and drink them while you watch the show.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mPDE4dMqAyLZNCR-tEYQ5w"}

We went to Firefly before and were really underwhelmed by the food there. In fact, every dish we tried (and we tried plenty) was on the average or under average side. \n\nWe're always on the hunt for tapas and hubby was adamant about NOT going to Firefly. I had bookmarked RE Tapas, but hubby wanted to try Ba Ba Reeba while we were at the mall so we thought we'd be smarter this time and order only a small selection in case it wasn't all that great either.\n\nThe restaurant shares its space with Stripburger -- very strange because it's so damn confusing. I wanted to sit by some natural light for the purpose of taking photos but wherever I pointed out was not part of Ba Ba Reeba.\n\nThe menu wasn't very big so it was quite easy to decide. The young man wanted a pizza and there were only 3 or 4 to choose from so we went for the chorizo. I got some garlic shrimp, sea scallops and Padron peppers as well. \n\nSangria is not bad here -- it's not sickly sweet and had a nice balance of the wine to fruit/juice. Very refreshing accompaniment to the meal.\n\nPadron peppers were grilled well with a sprinkling of sea salt to give it flavor. Seared sea scallops were fresh and juicy, well prepared, but the couscous and sauce was what brought this dish down. The flavors were underseasoned and did nothing to enhance the scallops. My favorite were the garlic shrimps. The shrimps were plump and extremely fresh and had a hearty helping of garlic in the dish. The olive oil was infused so strongly with the garlic we all used the bread to soak it up and wiped the dish clean.\n\nI wouldn't ordinarily order pizza at a tapas place but the one here wasn't bad as far as pizzas are concerned. The crust was very thin and the toppings of chorizo, cheese and cherry tomatoes were balanced correctly -- not too much and not too little.\n\nAll in all, I'd have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I'll even go as far to say that the garlic shrimps were better than at my favorite tapas place in SF -- Zarzuela. Yeah, I said it. It's better! We ended up getting an extra order of the shrimp since none of us felt we had enough.\n\nThe meal wasn't cheap -- a pizza, 4 tapas and 2 glasses of sangria came to almost $80 with tip included.

WTF??? So, we decided to come back on Christmas Day as soon as it opens and get in.\n\nChristmas morning, we arrived in line for the buffet at 11:07am (7 minutes after it opened) and there was a long line already. So what do we do? We get in line. I hate buffets. I hate waiting in line even more. However, it WAS Christmas and I did agree to hubby's request of wanting to eat here. He's been wanting to eat at the Wynn buffet the last few times we visited but I said no.\n\nSo there we were standing in line. Mind you, this isn't even the the line leading into the buffet. This was the line against the wall on the opposite side of the buffet. This is where you get a full view of all the people eating INSIDE in the dining room and all you can do is wait.\n\nThe line moves slowly. Luckily a friend was with us and so we were chatting. When the Wynn girls walked around passing out complimentary bottled water I was highly impressed and decided that the hotel was superb in customer service but still, the damn buffet better be mindblowingly good (yeah Frank K -- his suggestion for the Wynn buffet) to compensate for this waiting.\n\nBelieve it or not, but exactly 2 hours later we were at the front of the line, but not before forking over 50 bucks per person (lil guy was half price) tax included to go in for the \"Christmas Feast\".\n\nAfter we were seated, we made our way to the buffet. I was impressed by the lack of pushing and shoving along the buffet line. In fact, there just seemed to be very few people in the dining area. It then dawned on me that they make you wait because they didn't want their dining area to look and feel like a cafeteria which is essentially what a buffet is all about. This way, it still feels extremely civilized even though you're going through the lines like you do at a cafeteria and helping yourself to food.\n\nPROS: Peel and eat shrimps were already peeled and were large instead of the regular miniature sized ones you get at other buffets. The Alaskan King crab legs were fresh and not frozen. There was also smoked salmon, white anchovies, smoked trout and other smoked fish. Lobster/shrimp bisque was excellent.\n\nCONS: Although there was an abundance of meat such as lamb chops, the chops were overcooked and really dry. I was so disappointed that they ruined the lamb chops. The prime rib was rather good but again, I only like the end piece and it was really dry like jerky. The lamb shank was again over cooked.\n\nThere was also Chinese food including a few items of dim sum and roasted duck, Italian selections (which included thin crust pizza -- lackluster), a fish station with things such as halibut wrapped in bacon and a soup station. Like I said the bisque was fabulous but the french onion was way too salty. \n\nI think the Wynn uses really great ingredients to put their buffet together, but the execution of it was poor. They ruined great cuts of meat by overcooking and ruined the ceviches by bad marinades. For 50 bucks I had expected a lot more. The variety was very minimal as well for the 50 dollar price tag. I had expected a lot more variety especially since it was called a \"Christmas Feast\".  The regular dinner buffet is usually 10 dollar less but even so, if this was all they served I would say at 40 bucks a pop it was overpriced as well.\n\nThe desserts were hit and miss. The creme brulees were torched on site before placing on the shelves, but the creme itself was watery. The sorbet and gelato were also hit and miss in flavor depending on which one you got. I did enjoy the cheesecake and the sago (tapioca) pudding.\n\nTo have waited 2 hours for this meal garners it a mediocre rating at best. Not worth a 2 hour wait and definitely not worth its 50 dollar price tag.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

Our total was around $35. Okay so it wasn't cheap considering what we got, however, the bagel was toasted and the 3 slices of salmon were pretty big, plus it came with a few caperberries and a tub of cream cheese.

Since this was the only restaurant opened, we had no choice but to eat here.\n\nThe restaurant was comfortable and it being so late (for us it is late.... we're old!) we definitely welcomed comfy chairs. My big thing being in Vegas is to have French onion soup. This was a tradition a good Hawaiian friend of mine got me hooked on when we were in Vegas with them. Each time we'd go to a restaurant late at night, we'd order French onion soup. This one's for you dude!\n\nSo I got the soup and some chicken wings. Hubby got the salmon benedict.

Our waiter also brought us a bread basket of ciabatta rolls and corn bread. GOSH the ciabatta was so yummy. He brought us more.\n\nIn the end, I took the remainder of the wings AND the bread back to the room which I finished the next morning. \n\nService was great. Food was good but definitely overpriced.

It is 'jin yuan bao\" in Mandarin or \"gum yuen bo\" in Cantonese.\n\nWe had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. After we were seated, the tea and water was promptly brought to the table. However, when it came time for the dim sum trolleys to come around, it took forever. We were starving. Surprisingly, when they did roll around, the quality of the dim sum was pretty good!! Much better than what we can get in Irvine. The chicken's feet was tasty, so were the har gow. In fact, the har gow were so good we got 2 orders. \n\nService sucks shit and after I handed in our ticket to pay, the bill never got to us. After a while I got sick of waiting and walked up to the counter to pay. If service was good they would've gotten a full 5-stars because to find such great quality of dim sum in a hotel like this, is absolutely incredible.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tI3J5jomrBs--n7r92186g"}

I was lucky enough to get offered a week's stay and jumped on the chance!\n\nThis is a timeshare property and like all the Marriott timeshare properties, look and feel the same in the units. Each unit is equipped with everything you would need for your stay -- especially in the kitchen! -- but the only thing they don't do is offer maid service every single day, clean up of your room, emptying out of trash, replacing fresh towels (although if you want fresh towels they will accommodate that for free) that kind of stuff.\n\nI do like having a washer and dryer inside the unit, plus a full kitchen complete with a stove/oven and a full-sized refrigerator. Our one bedroom villa has a king sized bed plus a pull out sofa bed in the living room -- it's not terribly comfortable though.\n\nThe shower has 2 faucets but when you turn both on, one compensates for the other so one is very cold if you want the other one hot enough to feel comfortable. There is also a large tub in the bedroom if you want to take a bubble bath. There are two vanity areas -- one in the bathroom itself and one by the tub in the bedroom. There is also a TV in the living room and another in the bedroom, although the one in the bedroom is an old style one.\n\nI like everything about this place except, well, it's a timeshare, so they try to hard sell you when they find out you're not an owner. They want you to sit through one of those timeshare presentations (ugh, been there done that more than I'd like to remember) and they will give you free show tickets. Of course I passed! There is nothing worse than having to sit through one of those timeshare presentations because they tell you one hour, but my experience has always been around 3 hrs or more. By then, they have left such a bad taste in my mouth that the remainder portion of my vacation would be that I'd want to leave the property right away.\n\nI told the concierge that I'll think about it and get back to her.... well she won't be hearing back from me that's for sure! \n\nIf you like the feel of living in an apartment rather than a hotel and don't mind not having maid services every single day, this is a really good option to think about for your next stay!  You don't have to own a time share to stay in one of these --- they rent them out like a hotel -- just look around!!\n\nI can't tell you value for money because we didn't pay to stay here, but I can tell you that it's nice not having to constantly go out because the hotel room is too cramped to have a little space of your own. Right now, I can be in one room while the others are in the living room. I can also make something to eat without having to go out every single time I am feeling hungry.\n\nParking is valet only -- but it's free -- just tip. I know a lot of people don't like to valet their cars, but whenever we are in Vegas, we always valet so it makes no difference to me! This is also a smoke-free and non-gaming property so for me it's really great since I have a child.\n\nA stellar 4-stars!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ilJpQt_feaYBb5tvNLcwfA"}

Roti was served like Chinese scallion pancakes without the scallions. Accompanying curry sauce was flavorless even lil guy wouldn't eat it. Rojak was totally wrong. The sauce had no trace of shrimp paste (belachan) and the ratio of fresh vegs to the fried items was unbalanced. UGH!!! I even told the guy I wanted a heat level of 8/10 but when I tasted it I could not detect any heat in the rojak. Hubby got the curry laksa which was the only thing which my palate recognized though it was missing something. It did have curry leaves so that was a plus. However was not perfect by any means.\n\nService was too much. Every 3mins someone would ask if everything was ok and it would rotate between these 2 servers throughout our meal.

If it were good, I'd be shocked.\n\nSo after several attempts at trying to find good dim sum, we ventured to this place after I saw it advertised on the Chinese channel while watching TV in the hotel. Believe it or not the hotel had Chinese satellite TV feeding from Hong Kong. I was up late watching old Cantonese soap operas -- but I digress.\n\nSo anyway, one of the places advertised was this one. Hubby thought for sure the food was going to be good seeing it obviously catered to a Chinese clientele. Well he was right. The dim sum, although not artistically created into teeny weenie morsels, were done well. Not only that but everything tasted good. The tripe was steamed with ginger and scallions -- lots of flavor, not like the one at Chang's. In fact, the har gow was also very very good (unlike that of Chang's). Cha siu bao was above average (and I don't even like cha siu bao) and so was the stuffed bean curd sheets.\n\nI was a bit annoyed at the fact that when I asked for iced water, they kept passing the buck to someone else. Finally I just yelled out at a dim sum lady who then yelled out to 'amigo' in the back who rushed out towards me. Before he could even walk 5 steps I yelled out \"DOS AGUAS\" and he immediately turned around and got us 2 iced waters pronto.\n\n4 stars for decent dim sum.\n\n1 star for service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8-HkVgPClpSli0ug3Uk-sQ"}

He told me it was good and so we went there for lunch. I didn't know what to expect because I'm not really a big buffet person. When I go to a buffet, I end up eating the same old things. As long as they had the stuff I usually eat, I'm pretty happy.\n\nSo the line was already kinda long when we got there. The buffet here doesn't just run through the day but instead, between breakfast, lunch and dinner, there is an hour's pause. They close between that time and then reopen.\n\nIt didn't take long before we were through the line, paid and seated. At $8.95/person ($4.50 for lil guy) I thought it was pretty cheap. They had a BBQ station which has pork ribs, beef ribs, brisket, sausage, pulled lamb, chili and lil guy just dove straight into the pork ribs. They were pretty good. The beef ribs were so succulent and seriously, the brisket was some of the best I'd ever had. I generally don't like brisket because it tends to be dry, but this one was really really good. For something mass produced, it was awesome! SO much better than some of the BBQ places we've been to in the OC. \n\nThe other thing I eat a lot of at a buffet is the peel and eat shrimp. The shrimp here is very fresh. Some buffets have the shrimps which have spotty black stuff along the under belly of the shrimp. These were just pink with no signs of that. I must've eaten a whole pound on my own. the crab legs were also surprisingly flavorful. I never like eating crab legs because they are almost always frozen (as these were), but, they had flavor.\n\nThere is also a Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and American station. Lil guy was content eating ribs, pizza and ice cream. I just ate the shrimp, crab legs, ribs, the jambalaya (too watery), some corn meal crusted catfish (really good), some veggies, fruit and I tried one of the sugar free cream puffs.\n\nThe sugar free dessert varieties included pies and cakes too.\n\nFor $8.95 you also get a drink which our server kept refilling. Service was good. We asked for various items and he brought them out really quickly. For me, this buffet sufficed. I've eaten at the Bellagio (and various other higher end buffets) and I end up only eating the shrimp and lamb chops anyway, so for about $30, it's not really worth it.

I don't eat much else at a buffet, so I said let's go to the Orleans for their buffet since it's really cheap and I know they have peel and eat shrimp.\n\nOK so the pricing was super cheap -- it's $7.49 for lunch -- and it includes non-alcoholic beverages. There were the usual bbq stuff, Mexican stuff, Chinese stuff, Italian stuff, and an attempt at Mongolian bbq, which was rather dismal. \n\nI had about a pound and of a half of shrimp, a few slivers of bacon, 3 corn on the cob, a swirl of vanilla ice cream with crushed peanuts, 3 glasses of iced tea and I was done. I remembered last time they had these fantastic cookies, but there wasn't a cookie in sight. On top of that they have added a gelato station, but all the desserts were handed out, you couldn't help yourself to them.\n\nFor me, this buffet suffices because I don't really eat much at a buffet. Usually, I'll eat peel and eat shrimp, smoked salmon or trout, and lamb chops if they have them. What's the point of paying 20 bucks when that's all I eat? \n\nThe buffet at the Orleans is fine by me. It has the shrimp, and I'm happy to pay $7.50 for it!

I totally tasted the chile peppers and there was no heat to it, just the great aroma of chile. So far, my favorite. \n\nBlack Pearl (wasabi, ginger, black sesame seeds): couldn't really taste any of the ingredients. Tasted just like regular chocolate to me with sesame seeds on top.\n\nAlexis (curry): not bad.\n\nAbsinthe (Chinese star anise + fennel): I generally like star anise and fennel, but I do not like licorice which is basically what the flavor is... but this worked really well.\n\nEllateria (cardamon): I totally did not like this one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3eD46byrm9HE01MCTdrA2A"}

Lil guy even ate the spicy curry sauce and it wasn't lame like the one at Satay Malaysian Grill. This one had some heat to it. I was very proud that lil guy's taste buds were so refined, and most of all refined enough to like this one over the one at Satay. He was right, this one was far better than the one at Satay.\n\nMy other favorite dish is Hainan Chicken Rice ($5.75) and when it arrived I immediately dove in. WOW. The chicken was tender, the soy sauce was perfect and the accompanying chili/ginger sauce was awesome. I had to ask for more sauce it was THAT good. The chicken flavored rice was also delicious. Lil guy even liked this dish. I was very very happy.\n\nWe also got the Hokkien Char Mee or Hokkien style fried noodles ($6.95) was the weakest dish of all. They used the wrong noodles.... should've been egg or 'oil' noodles in Chinese, but it tasted like they used a variation of udon noodles. It was either that or they overcooked it so the texture became mushy. Wrong texture but good flavor.\n\nService was so-so, not bad but not outstanding. However, the meal was excellent so I was happy.

I've NEVER fallen asleep during one of these before.\n\nShe then massaged my legs and then laid 3 ottomans together so we could lay on it face-down so she could work on my back.

What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.\n\nThe XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.\n\nPotstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!\n\nSheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. \n\nAnd how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.\n\nDefinitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!\n\nCong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.\n\nI saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little. The sweet sauce they drizzle into it is also not overtly sweet and so, enhances the flavors without making it sickly sweet.\n\nDefinitely some really above average Chinese/Taiwanese breakfast foods I've tasted! This will stay on my list of places to return to whenever we're in town!\n\n4.5 stars!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g"}

Yes we had a kitchen but we didn't use it really -- we're in Vegas for god's sake. the fridge was a nice tough though since most nice hotels in Vegas don't have 'em unless you request for one. You can't remove the stuff from a minibar and put your own shit in.\n\nWe had a beautiful room with a beautiful bathroom, but the bathroom was so unpractical it was so tiresome having to do prep work every single day before we showered. Our bathroom had a tendency to flood -- water would run all the way down the floor towards the toilet. We ended up having to lay out tons of towels to soak up the water so our friend wouldn't slip and hurt herself AGAIN!\n\nThe elevators were also insane. It would stop on random floors not pressed -- up and down -- but not on the floor you needed to get out on. Worse yet, out of our 3 nights 4 days, more than 50% of the time, my card would not register so I can press our floor. It was crazy. It wasted so much of our time trying to get from our floor to the lobby and vice versa every single day. The ventilation was so bad inside the elevator that being stuck inside made us all want to vomit because the air quality was so poor.\n\nWe also had some trouble with housekeeping. We didn't get it! I called and requested them to come and give us fresh bathmats and towels because we had to use them all to soak up the flooded bathroom situation but after 5 hrs still nothing. No, I didn't wait 5 hours, I called and then returned later, 5 hrs later and STILL nothing. Had to call again before they'd bring it -- after 15 mins -- but at least they brought it.\n\nWhen you call housekeeping or front desk, it takes forever for them to pick up the phone so often you're stuck on the line for a good 5 minutes before someone picks up. The slow service also extends into the valet service. There seems to be only 1-2 valet attendant around at any particular time and they have to attend to the drop off AND pick up of cars. There is often no one at the valet booth and after they take your ticket, it takes forever for them to bring your car. One of the worst days was 18 minute wait from time of giving them my ticket to my car actually being delivered -- and yes I timed it!\n\nSo between the crazy elevator situation to the valet, we had to give ourselves a good 35 mins leeway leaving our room to go anywhere JUST in case we got caught up somewhere along the way.-- and no that did not include actual travel time which is usually only around 10 mins max.\n\nOur entire stay was rather frustrating although our bell hop Adam was a sweetheart and helped us out plenty. He needs a raise or a promotion! That's for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Jm11YjDPn9l74pbodGQ8hQ"}

When we found out it wasn't the place, we decided to eat here instead. We were starving and noticed that they had a 50% off appetizers during happy hour and we were right on time for happy hour. \n\nThe restaurant itself was decorated in a gaudy style with murals of the Acropolis and other Greek style architecture on the walls and ceilings. They have a full sized bar which during HH, all drinks are discounted, even non-alcoholic ones.\n\nWe hadn't looked at yelp prior to visiting obviously, but after our meal, I managed to look at the reviews on here and the other reviewers were spot on regarding the book of the menu. The listings are really confused with Japanese and Italian offerings as well -- namely, sashimi and pasta.\n\nWe stuck to the appetizer menu which consists of cold appetizers and hot appetizers -- taking up 3 pages.\n\nTaramosalata -- this wasn't bad but the taste of caviar did not come through\n\nMelanzanasalata -- or something like that  -- eggplant dip. This was nice and had a tart finish\n\nSpanokopita -- FAIL! The Trader Joe's version is far better. It was obvious that they had originally baked it and then when someone orders it, they popped it into the deep fryer to heat it up. Totally disgusting!!\n\nFalafel -- not grainy but rather, mushy and very dense! I didn't like these much\n\nDolmas -- their version had meat and rice inside instead of just rice. There is also this creamy-ish white sauce on it which didn't enhance these at all. Pass!\n\nGreek pizza -- pretty awful even the young man didn't want to eat it. We took it back to the hotel but no one even attempted to eat it so we ended up throwing it away. \n\nGreek cheese and olive plate -- this was a winner. We liked this one a lot. Two types of cheeses were offered along with Kalamata olives.\n\nDid I think the food was good? Not particularly. But some items weren't bad, the rest, just plain awful. If I had to pay full price I'd definitely tell you to pass! It's not worth it. However, at 50% off, our bill was actually quite reasonable for what we ate. I was even able to overlook some of the grosser items. Hubby had two drinks, one alcoholic and a Greek cherry juice. I had an iced tea. Our bill? About $40. Now double it and you're looking at $80. For $80 I'd say it was a totally awful meal. For $40? It's easier to swallow!\n\n2.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u0cuE27NIdXAil6i-scRGw"}

I mean, seriously? The other thing was, the sound system was HORRIFIC. The sound was just terrible. I've been to many norebangs in California and I thought their sound system was poor, but this one just takes the cake.\n\nThe service was good though. They were super friendly and nice and accommodating towards us when we ordered bucket after bucket of beer.\n\nThe other problem with their system was that you couldn't pre-set the songs in so it would be quick and smooth sailing. After each song, it then allows you to punch in the songs. It just wasted a lot of valuable time and the remote control would often not work.\n\nEven so, we had a good time, but I'm reviewing the norebang not how much fun I had.

My friends were lured in by the blaring music which we were familiar with and lucky for us, there was a table available so we sat down.\n\nShots are $18 but they are HUGE -- equal to 2 shots per order  so I thought the price was okay. On a Friday night, it was incredibly happening.\n\nWe got to dance -- tons of strangers just came up to ask us -- so just get up and do it! By 3.30am, it was still a crazy party in there, but we were ready to roll up to our rooms.\n\nServers are attentive even though the place is packed and we had an absolute blast.\n\nThis is definitely the spot if you like 80s music and don't want to stand in line to get into a nightclub.\n\nWould come back here again in a heartbeat!", "type": "review", "business_id": "30STskTEofV3eEaDBfvuFQ"}

I just loooooooove her handbags. Of course, the only location in Las Vegas was at the Forum so with lil guy in tow, we get there and I immediately made a beeline for the store located on the 2nd floor.\n\nLuckily, lil guy had his Nintendo DS with him and I sat him down on the comfy sofas and told him to stay put while I carefully inspected every single bag on display.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I narrowed it down to about 5 items. The salespeople were so helpful. They didn't rush me at all. One even brought out her own bag to show me how it looked with a lot of stuff in it. I must've spent about 40 minutes as I couldn't decide.\n\nFinally, I settled on the one I wanted -- which was the first one I picked up. The salesperson packaged it up in a lovely bag (even though it was for me) and finally sent me along my way. I had a huge beaming smile on my face when I left.\n\nYAY! I finally got my bag.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4cSk0aMqIHDVNC5WhWq_Zg"}

I had stayed at the Sahara before which used to stand in the same spot. Thinking it was a new hotel, and having been to the SLS in Beverly Hills, I had somewhat of an expectation when I arrived here.\n\nThe lobby was unimpressive, sharing space with the Monkey Bar and Perq, a grab-n-go operation serving sandwiches, coffee etc. Everything feels super chaotic when you take into consideration people waiting in line to check-in, and those lingering at the bar, plus those walking to and from the room to the casino.\n\nThe guy who checked me in was courteous and accommodated my request for a room closer to the elevator. I requested a non-smoking room, but when I got to the room, it smelled of cigarettes. I didn't have time to go back downstairs to contest this so just left it. The most surprising factor is the teenie tiny room I got in the World Tower. Our beds were full sized, not queen. The room had mirrors all over to create the feeling of spaciousness but it was super small. My friend who was sharing the room joked that it was designed by Ikea. Everything felt cheap -- not what I expected from the SLS brand.\n\nFor the online price we paid ($89 before tax and resort fees), I would say was a decent price. If I had paid more, I would have been really pissed off. There are other hotels on the strip which offer better rooms at similar prices and are located in prime real estate on the strip. SLS is on the very end of the strip so really, it shouldn't really be as expensive as other hotels. The casino is also tiny. \n\nWe got VIP entry into Foxtail, the nightclub, but even with free drink coupons, we didn't stay because it wasn't really enticing enough. All the tables were reserved for bottle service like all nightclubs are in Vegas and standing around while we drank is not appealing to me. The free drinks are super watered down so we ended up buying our own drinks anyway.\n\nWould I stay here again? Only if I absolutely have to and the prices were reasonable enough to make me want to. Otherwise, it really isn't worth it. It isn't a nice hotel, nor is it in a location where it is easily accessible even with the monorail -- which you now have to pay for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6i8vY-6gCQd5v6lZ8yne5Q"}
