Review Text :
The Wild Thaiger is one of my new favorite places.  Every dish I've tried as been excellent.  They accomodated with some grace a friend with food allergies and were polite -- too polite -- in serving me as I (unknowingly) arrived just at closing.  The peanut sauce on the satay is amazing.  Pad Thai is a standby at a Thai place, but it definitely does not disappoint here.  The beef curry was excellent.  The ginger fish dish less remarkable but still good.  Coconut ice cream dessert is good for putting out the fire.  Good place to go after an Art or Heard museum visit.I actually like this place. I find the mood to be nice and the lighting just right. The food is well prepared and the alcoholic drinks are fantastic. Martinis! My one complaint....they need to add some more vegetarian dishes.  I find myself ordering this great appetizer every time I go there because it's the only thing with tofu on it. Anyways, it's a great place for a date :)The wait was pretty long. But I'm not a very patient person, I'll admit. I went during lunch with my family, so I was able to taste a bit of a few dishes. First of all, their lunch menu is really small. When I sat down and realized that my favorite dishes weren't even on their menu, I was immediately disappointed. I had their papaya salad and honestly, it wasn't that great. It was actually one of the worst ones I've ever had. The flavoring was really off. How do I know? I am Thai and grew up there, so I know what som tum is supposed to taste like. And it really does not taste like that. I had some of their pad thai also and was really really disappointed. I mean, for the prices they charge and for the wait time and horrible service, I was really expecting something really good. The mood was actually really nice. Their decorations and open kitchen were a really nice touch, which is what they're getting the star for. However, it did become very loud very fast when the room filled up. It was difficult to keep a conversation going. For all the hype that people have made about this place, I honestly expected a lot better. But even if I walked in without any expectations, I would have still be disappointed.Oh Wild Thaiger, how I do love thee! Actually, to be more specific, how I do love pad thai. I hadn't been to Wild Thaiger in a while because I hate navigating around Central Avenue these days, but it was my co-worker's birthday and she wanted Wild Thaiger. I'm so so glad we went there, and I was double happy this afternoon when I ate my leftovers for lunch. The best thing about the pad thai at Wild Thaiger (besides that it is so good) is that there is so much I always have lunch the next day ( which is just lovely). A note for those south of McDowell trying to get to Wild Thaiger: Drive up 3rd Street and turn left on Roanoke. You'll dead end into a strip mall parking lot. Park there and walk a few steps south to Wild Thaiger. Viola! I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I ordered a Coke and it tasted funny ... like way too soda-watery. When I told the waitress, she sort of shrugged and said, "A lot of people say that." Yeah .... I had to ask, "So, can I get something different please?"But my pathetic Coca Cola aside, it was a great lunch, and she even brought my co-worker toasted coconut ice cream in a coconut dish with a candle. How sweet!Over-priced, over-crowded designer Thai joint.I've only been there once, and for lunch, but it was the kindof underwhelming experience that makes it not worth the trip back.First off, if you come at lunch time, you have to deal with hoards of suits who come here for it's lush interior design to serve as the backdrop to their loud and uninteresting war stories. Next, you have to accept a very short and unimpressive lunch menu that has next to nothing that I usually get at a Thai restaurant. Finally, you have to sift through a very bland and unauthentic entree with excellent presentation.I really should go back and try it again. But with the likes of Thai Hut now open, I don't know why I ever would unless I was forced through a work trip. Especially with how bland the food is for a Thai restaurant. I prefer Thai food that lights me up like a Christmas tree.I like this place. Although it gets really busy around noon. My favorite dish is gapraogui. I love how the kitchen is visable, while you are dining, and you dont smell like the kitchen when you leave. I mostly go for the food, its not a place I would hang out there with people and drink.The Wild Thaiger is the best kept Thai restaurant secret on North Central Avenue.  My first culinary experience at Thaiger was several months ago with co-workers. My omnipresent dinner companion Marcial and I, have been habitual customers since.Office employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.  The food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go.Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce. The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want "more curry", "spicier" or "hotter" you only need to ask. Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.Drink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea. It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.Note:  METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger.  Drive slow, this Tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle.OK, I didn't want to go here because the name sounded like "wild thingy", which sounds like bad porn movie.  Also, looked pretty sketch from the outside, but I have learned that is pretty common in Phoenix.  My Thai craving kicked in and I had to have some "thingy."It was packed inside for a weekday night, which is a good sign.  My tom yum soup and spicy basil chicken were right on the mark.  I think this would be a great carry out place and from all the sacks lined up, I guess everyone else likes to eat "thingy" too!Bland, blech, barf. That's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) I think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice. No spice. No life. No business from me.UPDATE 5/19/2008Finally. Me and the Thaiger are purring like happy kittens. I've discovered their yellow curry at lunch and it is dee lish! Prices are insanely low, tho the lunch menu is limited. Service is upbeat and more polished. Now, a purrrrfect place for me to lunch!!! Hello Kitty!!!!I think Hello Kitty is wildier than this cat. Veggie tempura. I've had crispier wafers from a priest. Pad Thai. Wouldn't say it was bad, but, hmmm, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh, I know BLAND! I've had tastier wafers from a priest. I love the chef. Very approachable and like, totally, super nice. Wait staff, on the two occasions I've been there, were a little inactive. I've had more action from a priest. I'll go again. Try new things. But only after I do the Rosary.Had lunch here last year, I was presently surprised! The building is unique, the location sublime, and the cuisine is way above average. I am big on the yellow chicken curry - Yum!Had dinner here recently, I was somewhat surprised that it was not the same tremendous experience I had remembered at lunch so long ago. Perhaps they are slipping, or more likely I am :)I have to go with a solid 4 stars on this one because even if the food is not spicy enough for you, there are so many other reasons to love it.The atmosphere is great.  I like everything from the tables and booths to the patio.  It is easy to hang out and have a good meal with friends, or to tuck yourself away in a corner...The service has always been top notch for me.  I have been there when I was in a hurry, and I was able to eat and run without having to beg for service.  I also have had long leisurely dinners and was always happy with the attentive, but not pushy service.I LOVE their pad thai.  It's a little different from the other places I have gone, in a good way.I'm only sorry they have had such a time with the construction outside their door.  a nice place doesn't deserve that hassle.I had heard quite a bit about this thai place that is down the street from my office. after 8 mos. Of hearing about it, finally, we decided to walk over and pick up some food.then I read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind. The reviews were pretty bad: several reports of poor service and the -the most alarmingly one of all - pointing out how bland and flavorless the food was. also, there were descriptions of it being a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent servers. Did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger?I was surprised because all the times I drove past it - before realizing how popular it was - I thought it looked typical of a thai/asian place. The name was silly and cheesy, and the giant purple banner that takes up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest. has just the eyes of a tiger staring at you from their very purple perch. How can this place possibly be too-cool?I checked out their web site (which I was surprised to find they had one as this place looks pretty hole-in-the-wall) so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up. the site was pretty slow and I almost gave up, but I was pretty stoked on the options and the prices. Grilled peanut chicken? Sounds great. Spicy chicken curry, I'll take it. tiger prawn salad, ok. All for about $8?? Sounds pretty reasonable. I went with the curry chicken and the spring roll (all lunch items come with either soup of the day or the roll - unless your taking out, as they won't/can't do soup to go.)Off we went and when we walked up I was surprised to find that the ramada-like, large patio with high walls and iron bars took up the entire front of the building. We had to search around for the hidden entrance. Once inside it was busy with a downtown business casual crowd, but a scurrying waitress still held the door and asked if we wanted a table (for the record she was not in skinny jeans, flats and sporting tons of eyeliner and a fauxhawk, as I figured she would be).  We walked up to the bar to collect our food and pay, and the lively atmosphere made me sad we were going back to the office and not eating there. the bar area had a flat screen tv, there was lively if a little over-the-top Asian pop music, and the healthy crowd was a nice change of pace. Alas, we were in and out (they were not even put out by our asking to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately, even though they were obviously busy) in under 10 minutes.The food stayed pretty hot for the 15 minute walk back, and they double bagged each Styrofoam box -thank god, as half my curry sauce came out of the box. It smelled great and the veggies looked good, but I braced myself for disappointment. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be bad, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Mine was just enough spicy as is (for me, though and I'm a wuss - so If you're into hot-hot-hot, ask to punch it up a notch or three) and the serving was plenty for the price. The veggie spring roll was great - not even soggy from the trip, how did that happen? I think the curry sauce was a little thin, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again - my coworker's ginger chicken sauce looked thin as well, but she said it was still great. The tiger prawn salad had green, fresh lettuce (looked like a spring mix) and came with lots of scrimps that were "fat and juicy." However, they listed that the salad came with crispy wontons, but her box was sans any wontons - really the only foil in the entire experience.All in all I would say it was a score. The three of us agreed that it would make a good HH spot.It's no yupha's, but certainly better than thai basil - and not a chain. Plus they were still busy, busy despite being smack in the middle of the light rail cluster fuch on central - they must be doing something right!My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from Northern California, the land of good Thai, and Wild Thaiger was the first Thai place we tried in the Valley of the Sun. Let's just say that the quality ingredients and enticing flavors made us feel a little less homesick. The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos. They were appropriately strong and actually quite good! All around, a really great experience.Ok, I had tried this place a month or so ago at lunch and was unimpressed, but the other day a friend said she wanted it for dinner.  I obliged.  I was blown away by the Panang curry.  Rich, thick, spicy.  We had it for take out and it survived the trip home fine.  I now need to go back and try some other dishes just to make sure it wasn't just a freak occurrence.Being a bit of a Thai fan, I had driven by Wild Thaiger a number of times only to find it next to impossible to get reliable access due to all the light rail construction (I suspect my frustration and quitter mentality was pretty commonplace during the construction).  Now that the rail is almost up and running and getting to Wild Thaiger isn't such a chore, I went with a group of 6 to try this place out.When you walk in you immediately notice how dark it is as the lighting given off by candles and the kitchen in the back.  I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight.  However, this place was almost pitch black at times to where I couldn't see my dish so they could improve on the lighting a little bit.  The booths are small and set up very nice if you're just out on a date with your special someone.The menu selection isn't vast but has all the usual suspects (curries, noodles, tofu dishes, etc.).  I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.Most of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).They also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.Overall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.Bottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.  Based on what we've seen, this place had a pretty solid local following so clearly they've done something right.  This place is okay if you're looking to go out with a group, but I'd probably enjoy this place more if it was just me and my girlfriend.We went back here this past Saturday night with a friend from out of town and liked it just as much as we did when we tried it a few months ago. My Cosmopolitan was just as big and tasty as it was last time, and the service was still attentive and friendly. My friend is a pescetarian/flexitarian (doesn't eat meat except for fish), and we were really pleased to find that all of the dishes we ordered that we usually get with meat were still absolutely delicious. Specifically, the Pad See Ew (which we usually get with chicken or beef) was still savory with just the fried tofu and perhaps even more amazing, the Mussaman curry (which usually comes with a deliciously braised beef) was still really flavorful and was complimented nicely by the tofu. Even after trying a decent number of other Thai places in Phoenix, we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar, consistently good flavors, great service, and fun atmosphere, and we will definitely continue to come here often.Wild Thaiger was a convenient choice for quick and easy take out on a Thursday night I had no interest in cooking.  The menu is somewhat limited in my opinion - no masaman or choo chee curries and no crispy duck, which are my favorite Thai staples .  So I got an order of beef panang, an order of pad thai, and was intrigued by the dragon eggs app.The dragon eggs were atrocious.  But the pad thai and beef panang were both good.  Not great, not mind blowing, but not horrible.  And for around $10 each they were pretty good sized portions.  I could see myself ordering take out again or actually dining in for a casual meal.Love this place for some decent Thai! Shrimp & Chicken Pad Thai is always good and never disappoints, the soups are great, I also really like their Beef Panang. Their desserts always sound good and they usually have something that involves mango, how I have escaped never trying one is beyond me. Their over all menu is a bit limited and is kept to the basics but what they do have is done well.I have been craving Wild Thaiger for a year now (last time I was in town they were closed). The flavors are perfectly blended, the food is artistic, and the food choices are unlike that I've seen at two other Thai restaurants I've eaten at recently. Their Thai Iced Tea has to be some of the best I've tasted thus far. Its typically quiet which was perfect for girl's day out and chatting.Service is unpredictable. Sometimes it is very good and sometimes it is very bad. The pad thai here is delicious but has way too much chicken. The kiew wan curry is very spicy and very good. The spring rolls are also very tasty. The hot pots are just ok, a little too much coconut milk it makes it a bit too sweet.For dessert the coconut ice cream sprinkled with peanuts is a great ending. It is open Sundays which is rare downtown.I had high hopes for this restaurant.  It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.I'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.I opened my green curry and said: "WHERE'S THE SAUCE"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....The Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.While I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.Overall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.Recently went back with a party of 10 for a bday celebration.It was my pick, and I did consider how a party of ten could be a disaster in a small-ish, "we're just a hole-in-the-wall that happens to be really popular" place like WT. And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. The host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were "recovering." Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was "ready."It was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. I got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over "I'm so glad I got this!"All these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues. Don't think I'll go back to dine in - ever.I was at your grand opening, I was there after, and I'm not there anymore. Wild Thaiger was never a great option for Thai in the valley. There aren't really any terrible aspects about the restaurant, it's just that nothing really makes you say "wow! this is good."My last visit was with a friend who doesn't get out much, his wife likes good ol' steak and potatoes, so I thought I'd take him somewhere he couldn't go otherwise. Bad choice. We ordered the peanut chicken and it tasted more like peanut butter chicken. It was overpowering, and also one of the first times I have ever sent a dish back and asked for something else. Of course the service is good, they never have anything better to do.When back twice and the service was excellent both times and the pad thai is still pretty tasty, but still too much chicken in it.Stopped in for the first time after a show at the Phoenix Art Museum. It was late but the staff was very accommodating. All we ended up ordering was some beer and a bunch of apps, but everything tasted great and the service was pleasant.We sat out on the patio which was a little noisy form the road noise, but not bad. We plan on going back for a full meal next time.I called four times last night to place a to-go order (7:30p-8p) and got their recording each time.  Either this place is SO busy they can't get to the phone or they had closed up early and went home.  I'm still craving Thai...and looking for a great place in Central Phoenix.  Any other suggestions or should I give this place another chance?Went to lunch at the Wild Thaiger yesterday after having no luck ordering to-go a couple weeks ago.  We sat outside on the covered patio, which was pretty busy.  Our server was prompt and pleasant.  The food: I ordered chicken with peanut sauce and Jasmine rice.  The sauce was very flavorful, but no heat at all.  I'm used to peanut sauce with just a bit of heat and was mildly disappointed with this dish.  My friend ordered the Pad Thai and it was good, but again not much heat.  Now our server did not ask us about stars or heat at all.  If I were to go back I would order the Pad Thai with a side of peanut sauce and add more heat.All in all, an affordable lunch, good service, and decent Thai food.  I would like to go back in the evening to check out the inside as I never set foot in it.  Maybe try another dish too.Phoenix Yelpers- any other awesome Thai places to try??I have had some good digestive experiences here. Also, I have kin who works here... so that's another incentive for you to step in.I am not a huge fan of Thai food, mainly because I have not been exposed to enough of it...but I CRAVE the Beef Panang from Wild Thaiger!  I have had it twice along with the Pad Thai and Kimowi (sp?).  The iced green tea was refreshing and wished I had saved room for the lemon ginger cheesecake.  I have tried dining in and take out both (dinner only), and the only reason I don't go 5 stars is the very slow (but friendly) service.  Plan to wait at least 5 minutes to be greeted by your server and once the food is finally served...your on your own.I have only been here once, but what I ate was awesome! I love that it's right off the light rail too. We did a "rail day" not too far back where we just jumped on the rail and tweeted as we went. Following recommendations from fellow twitter users we stopped here for lunch and ended up at the heard museum (also right off the rail). All in all a really great day. Good food, good people and a ha beer. I order the same stuff every Thai restaurant. Coconut Ice Cream is good...ate at the bar....they let me have the remote to the TV too....perfect.totally yummy food!  I love their appitizer veggie sampler, and their desserts are good too.  I recommend the thai custard.Wifey and I hit the Wild Thaiger up after a trip to the Phx Museum of Art. great choice. Friendly service and modern decor. The food was excellent. Phoenix is lucky to have this place.Excellent Thai food!  Consider sitting out on the patio; there are nice tables and heaters for the winter.  I am usually pretty bored with the spring rolls I order at other restaurants, but these were really good.  They offer some unusual menu choices as well such as corn fritters.  It's basically deep fried corn which sounds awful but tastes heavenly.  They are good about suiting the spice level to your preferences.  The staff is friendly and can offer good suggestions.  Also, they have a decent beer selection.I met someone here for dinner one night... They have the best Pad See Ue (sp?) that I have ever tasted. They sprinkle fried garlic over it and I love the burst of garlic every time I bite into one. Service was decent and the wait staff was very attentive. We had papaya salad, beef salad, chicken and beef satay and green curry. Everything was delicious. I live in the very northern parts of Phoenix but do not mind the drive. It is worth it.Great food and generally good service. Lunch time can turn into a loong wait, but it's always worth it. Green Curry, mmmmmmmmmmm!Oh, Gaprao Gai, how I love thee.  Nom.My 2nd time here, last time was part of a big group, this time was much better! Able to relax and enjoy it! Had kimow chicken and must warn, it hot! But I like my Thai food hot!! My date ,he had the beef panang(red curry beef) also had Thai iced tea for drinks, definitely needed something cold and refreshing!! and for dessert, omg! Had lemon ginger cheescake, was fantastic!!  Love this place and plan to return!!3/5/10My second attempt to dine here, as it was so busy the first time (and so noisy!), that I had to leave.  (It was during lunch hours, and I don't like to wait.)  Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the "atmosphere" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them.Galee gai is the cure-all for allergies, the flu or a hangover. Trust me, I know hangovers.The waitresses are all amazing and beautiful and nice.Friday and Saturday nights usually yield an awkward wait (who was really here first?).I have never had a bad meal or experience here.I love the Wild Thaiger, it is the best Thai food I have experienced in Phoenix.  They have plenty of vegetarian options and I have ordered just about all of them, they are all equally delicious.  I love the corn fritters... MMMMWent to Wild Thaiger two nights ago, I have been before, but my girlfriend had not. I love Thaiger so I wanted to share the tastiness. I figured I would write a review since I have not yet.Wild Thaiger is in the heart of uptown Phoenix. Central and Thomas area. Cool little restaurant with a nice atmosphere inside.Food is great and very fresh. I like that you can see the entire kitchen from most of the tables in the restaurant. They have nothing to hide. Prices are pretty standard at between 8.95-14.95 for dinner entrees. Great food and wonderful service. Nice change from other Thai restaurants in Tempe, Chandler, Mesa, etc.I was surprised at how good this place was. A friend and I went on a whim and the crowd inside was a lot older (60's-70's) and mostly just drinking. We ordered the Tom Kai Gai and I have to say it was the best I've ever had in Arizona. It was spicy but extremely flavorful the consistency of the rice was gloriously sticky.We also tried the hot teas I ordered the Gunpowder Temple of Heaven and she got the Lemon Souffle` and both were beautifully prepared and flavored. The Pad Thai and Panang were both spiced to perfection and the service was great and our waitress was so friendly and helpful I wanted to come back the very next day. They also work with you on how spicy you want your dishes so if you prefer an extra kick just ask but I'd recommend trying the dishes how they prepare them first since I like spice and thought they did a great job of making the dishes spicy but not to the point where the spice overpowers the dish.The food was honestly 4-star worthy, SO tasty. BUT because they accidently glutenated me, I'm going to give it a bummer three-stars. I asked the waitress if anything was gluten free and she said, "the pad thai. all the people ask for it. it's safer". I knew after the word "safer" I was in for a real treat. The pad thai was amazing, but then after feeling strange, I called back and asked probing questions about what was in it. I argued with the woman over fish paste, and she said the fish paste had wheat in it...and it was in the pad thai, yet the pad thai was gluten free? EEK. If you're a celiac, be careful and just go through the ingredients of what you want to order. The hot tea was amazing, and they offer the honey sugar packets - great! If you're not gluten-free - FOR SURE GO HERE FOR THAI! It's amazing. If you are, just be very very careful!Usually when my friends go on and on about how they love a restaurant, I can't wait to get in and try the food. Our tastes are often a match. The first concern I had from the beginning was the fact that there was only one person of Thai descent working and she was slinging the stuff they were selling. We open the menu to find reasonably priced fare (a soft spot for my wallet). Many of the dishes you would be accustomed to finding in any Thai restaurant could also be found on the menu here. Since it was my first visit to this establishment, I decided to go safe and ordered the Pad See Iew with Chicken. Once it arrived, I was pleased with the presentation. But in my many years of eating I have learned, just because it look good fo show don't mean it goin' da taste good!! To be fair it wasn't horrible... but I certainly have had better. The waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive. Something just seemed a little off about her? I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that was off... but if I do, I'll let you know. Perhaps one thing could have been the fact that a table of 8 came into her section about 15 minutes after we arrived and we seemed to have been just forgotten. To sum it up folks... if you are in the area and you want a REAL Thai dish with plenty of kick hit up Thai Hut on McDowell and 1st St. Amazing food served by the people that invented the stuff, and prompt extremely attentive service.One night we decided to look for a good thai restaurant in CenPho, and upon some searching and previous good reviews, we chose to try the Wild Thaiger. We started the meal off with the corn fritters. They were crispy and delicious and had a yummy cucumber chutney with them. For my entree, I had the Tofu Mangone and it was awesome. I love spice, and not just a little, I like a lot, and my dish certainly turned up the heat. We finished the meal with the blueberry kaffir lime cheesecake. It was creamy, cool, and a wonderful way to end a meal. I'm so happy to have found a good thai place!I have been to the Wild Thaiger several times and I decided I should write a review because it is such a great restaurant. I went for lunch this time and the service was great. Although it was slightly loud, the food more than made up for it. Started out with lettuce wraps and ended with pad Thai. It was amazing! Very tasty :)I used to go here once every two weeks for lunch with my coworkers.It's extremely delicious Thai food, if slightly difficult to get a table if you are a group of 8 or more (understandable...) Pad thai + curries are excellent. Ambiance = extrememly fun. Hot sauce and peppers = extrememly available.The drinks here are HIGHLY recommended. Lychee + Gin Martinis. YES YES YES YES YES. I'm not sure why I havent started making this at home. I had my union going away party here on the patio. So awesome in the fall and winter!Oh also the staff is awesome. Not only are the waitresses EXTREMELY attractive but also very nice and always remembered our big gang of fools.Craving Thai, I wasn't willing to drive all the way up to Siam Thai, on 51st Ave and Northern, to get my fix and I had yet to try the Thai my own neighborhood had to offer. Deciding on Wild Thaiger, I chose to save Thai Hut for another time. They offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose. Seeing no one out on the patio (yea it was warm out but not that uncomfortable), I entered the restaurant and was greeting and seated quickly, choosing a spot at the bar. Thai iced tea in hand I reviewed the menu. Hummm, ok pretty standard menu, but being a fan of curries I noted my choices were limited. I guess I could have had them sub the beef for chicken in the dishes but I wasn't feeling up for the hassle. After a process that seemed like forever, I decided to start off with the Tofu Towers Appetizer and settled on the Green Curry with beef. The tofu towers were well presented with a cucumber "chutney" / salad that was fresh with a vinegarette that still didn't do much for the tofu. [The same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai is more clean and crisp.] While green curry's are not generally my favorite (I often find them bland and less flavorful than a red), the beef green curry was tasty. The heat was one that built up slowly as you ate but was never overwhelming to the overall dish. The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly. While overall I can't complain, I can say I have had better but it is a worthy option when seeking a quick Thai fix. Still craving a good curry I guess I know what I will be making at home this weekend. Or maybe I will try Thai Hut.Food was alright. Service was the worst I have ever experienced. I took almost two hours for us to receive our food. I haven't and will not go back. THAI HUT IS MUCH BETTER/CHEAPER/BETTER SERVICE!!i've had a few dishes here...the veggie curries hit the spot for me...but the one dish that sticks out in my memory is the seafood panang. even though i am put off by the textures of  some sea creatures (especially squid and mussels), i love this dish. the sauce is savory, spicy, sweet, and rich. the assortment of seafood in this panang consists of salmon, scallops, mussels, and squid.  the salmon pairs quite well with panang sauce, as do the tender scallops. the mussels taste wonderful in this dish despite their graphic texture...the squid is rubbery and i can't recall a time when i've not eaten rubbery squid. is there a way to make its texture more palatable?...despite the squid, i probably order wild thaiger's seafood panang once a month when i can afford to do so and when i am craving a protein rich meal. the veggie spring rolls here are okay, but not amazing. the thai iced tea is standard, which is good. the tom yum (or was it tom kah?) soup was unique as it had a sharper flavor than i'm used to--more spices seemed to be used, and it tasted fresher than some of the thai soup i've had in other thai places. overall, i have to say i love this restaurant when i'm in the mood for thai.I always eat here, since A) the food is great, B) it's super close, and C) the wait staff is really friendly.  I've never had bad service here, and I come all the time.  Although, maybe that's why I get good service, because I come all the time. :)  I must admit, though, I only rotate through maybe four dishes on the menu.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service.I am a huge fan of spicy food and this stuff knocked my socks off. If you aren't as adventurous with your spices (or just don't want your tongue to die) simply ask them to make it mild. All in all super yummy, will def be back. Oh and you have to try the thai iced tea. Its mental how good it is.I gave it 3 stars because I don't want to throw around stars and save them for those rare AWESOME moments when food knocks my socks off :DEnjoy!I haven't been in a while but I remember being impressed.  Nice ambiance, especially for a Thai restaurant.Finally got to eat at this place after driving by so many times.  It was great - great food, great set up, great vibe, great servers, everything was just great.  Went for lunch and got 2 great meals off the lunch menu and our total bill was $20...can't beat that.  The iced tea was a little different but in a good way - I think it was a green tea iced tea.  Very impressed, will definitely be going back.It was fine.  A fine thai meal to have before a rock show downtown.  Would I go again if I were in Phoenix, probably not, maybe so.  The service was fantastic, the food was fine, the place just had a weird energy, or maybe that's just a Phoenix thing.Wild Thaiger was very cozy and inviting. This was my first time eating Thai food so I was looking to have a great experience unfortunately the service or lack there of almost ruined it for me. They were not very busy but it took about 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us. The server took another 15 minutes to take our drink order. The Thai iced tea was really different but very good. We ordered some chicken egg rolls and when they finally came or they were amazing! Our main dishes took forever to come out and it was just ok. I think I like Thai food.but I will not be returning here.This place is really our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix area by far. The corn fritter appetizer is so yummy and I love their pad thai, which I usually get vegetarian with tofu. I have not had any veggie pad thai that is better anywhere else!  Wish it were closer to us, we'd go a lot more often if it was.I've eaten at a number of Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area, and this definitely is in the top 3.  The food is great as was the service and it has a cozy patio if you enjoy eating outside or are a smoker.  The price was also reasonable.   They do serve alcohol, although I'm not sure if it was full bar or beer/wine service only.Husband and I decided to try this place out based on the great Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!  We ordered takeout, and weren't too adventures.  I ordered the Beef Panang and husband ordered a peanut chicken dish.  Both were delicious, the chicken was moist and flavorful, and the Panang had just the right amount of spice.  One of my main complaints with the local Thai eateries is that they generally do not provide much spicy kick, but Wild Thaiger knows how to pack the punch.  Definitely do not order the spicy dishes if you can't take the heat.Went there on a first friday night, they were slammed but the waitress was still very attentive.  We ordered pad thai, tom ka gai and sticky rice, all three were delicious!  Great patio too.Very mediocre. There are two better thai options in the downtown area... Thai Elephant and Thai E San. Wild Thaiger had mediocre curry ( i have tried to enjoy dinner there two times,  and horrible, slow service. Check out the places I mention above.In the land where many of the Thai restaurants simply rotate proteins, carbs and a standard vegetable medley, Wild Thaiger dishes out more authentic versions of traditional Thai specialties.  I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse and grace.  Yum to the freakin' yum.I have been here numerous times and almost always get the Pad Thai and always leave stuffed and happy.  I like Thaiger because I feel very appropriate drinking wine with my Thai food because of the swanky interior of the place.  I especially love the open air patio where I took my mom to dinner when she came to visit.  Some say this place doesn't have the best Thai food in the Valley and with so many options I would not be surprised if there is a superior Thai place somewhere.  However, in terms of classy Thai in Phoenix, you can't beat Wild Thaiger.  Also, I love the pun in the name.  There, I said it.If you can get past the goofy name, the food is pleasing in every way. How the staff behind the line can pump out delicious dishes like the best pad thai I've ever had, present each plate in something resembling high art, and not explode despite a fast-food pace is beyond my meager understanding. It's an Eastern thing, dude.Also amazing: The female wait staff. Just go. You'll see what I mean. Yeah. Incredible.Anyway, a good place to remember on North Central.Since enjoying authentic Thai food in Bangkok and particularly at the Oriental Hotel 20 years ago, I have waited for the day that a Thai restaurant somewhere else approached the delicate blend of flavors of those first tastes. It happened at Wild Thaiger. The soup and the curry were wild and wonderful, and this weekend we were dismayed to find out that we couldn't get take-out before 5pm, but we will be back soon. Big portions. Highly recommended!The food is super tasty, the decor is nice, but the service could be improved upon. My husband and I try to stop here if we're in the area because the food is so delicious and elegantly served. The pad Thai and curries are tasty as is the Thai iced tea (creamy sweet tea with ice). I usually order the yellow curry with chicken. Lunch hour is very busy so you might get stuck waiting for your server. Once we went after the lunch-hour rush, but still ended up with sub par service because the staff was eating their lunch. Despite the sometimes slow service, we come back because of the quality and taste of the food.Went on my birthday after St. Francis had an hour long wait.  Very happy with our decision.  Had the ginger martini.  Very sweet, but very good.  Then, we shared the vegetarian appetizer plate.  The corn fritters are mind blowing good!  Never had anything like that before.  I had the tofu pad thai, which was perfect!  The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The whole place had a positive vibe and friendly (though not the most prompt) service.  Will go back again for sure!I can only say that it was amazing!  I am a fan, and the service was really great.  I recommend trying this place if you like authentic Thai food.  I will definitely be going back.I had a surprising lunch at the Thaiger.  Received a royal welcome from a singularly beautiful Thai woman, sit where you want, move chairs to be more comfortable, we are so glad you are here etc etc.  Then nothing.Maybe it was our fault as we chose outside on a cloudy cool day.  After no response, I went in ordered food.  Food was delivered 45 minutes later.  Didn't have a complete place setting and they never returned so I trudge back inside and so it went.Then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived.  Why ask about spice levels?  Another trip to the bar for some peppers.  They gave me chopped serrano peppers so I can only conclude the kitchen was not attentive to our choices.We chose WT based on Yelp reviews and have to say it looked like they would know Thai food and maybe on a different day the experience would be better.   However, on our visit, we were treated as intrusions instead of guests and are not likely to be back.  Not worth the time or money solid 2 stars.MikeLet me say that this is by far the best Thai food I have had in Phoenix. The atmosphere is great very friendly staff we were seated right away and made to feel right at home. I had the strawberry Champagne Martini it was very well made. I must say this place is great for a first date anniversary or valentines the owner is wonderful I recommend this place as a romantic spot for a couple. I will continue to go back as long as they are opened.You won't be disappointed. We've eaten here about 7 times now, and we are ALWAYS delighted. The Beef Panang is just killer. The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees. Another note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine. It's definitely Thai...but upgraded. In my opinion, it's perfect. It's also a good place to take someone on his or her first taste of Thai.mediocre Thai food. nothing bad but nothing special. ordered Tom Yum soup that lacked Thai basil, Keiffer

Restaurant name  Domino's Pizza  sentiment : very negative
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Not the same Domino's pizza I ate too much of in College. Vastly different and a major improvement! Ordering on-line couldn't be easier, and pizza was made exactly how I ordered. Piping hot, flavorful, better than average crust, nicely blackened in all the right spots, tasty toppings, robust sauce. Friendly delivery by John. Price is fair. Much, much better than Pizza Hut!Easy ordering-on-line. Made exactly as I asked for. Piping hot. Sauce is SO, SO much better than their old stuff. Crust is like having an order of buttery-garlic soft bread sticks with your pizza. Delivery is super-fast, with charming, pleasant personality driver(s.) Our guests were apprehensive about eating Domino's from past experiences, and after the first bite, were practically inhaling pieces it was that good! I can tell that it is hand-made fresh. The dough is light and airy, the cheeses are tangy and savory, the meats are generous and better quality than most. My first choice in chain pizzas.OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few "adult" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying "who ordered pizza" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called "their customer service" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there....never has crushed peppers! but the pizza ain't too shabby.The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value.I normally don't have a problem with Dominos--you pretty much know what you're getting for your money.Unfortunately, this Dominos, even though it is less than 3 miles away, won't deliver to my address. Not only will they not deliver, but they will take my order, ask me what the cross-streets are (so they KNOW how far I am), and wait 30 minutes before calling to tell me that they cancelled my order.They could have checked my address when I gave it to them, or they could have called and asked if I wanted to pick it up instead, but instead they simly cancelled my order--and didn't let me know until it was supposed to be at my door,I don't usually write reviews for chains but this Domino's was bad, even for "fast food pizza" standards. Way too greasy, and it was definitely stale, old grease. Ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad. Cheese only was edible, but anything we had with toppings was bad. Not coming back.I have always ordered pizza from dominos and the delivery have been so so. I'll get my food and it'll be okay warm and okay good. That's also might be due to the fact that I always get the same stuff. But TONIGHT I got something different. I got a hot sub, bacon and ranch sub. The delivery was really fast for once but the best part was that the food was super hot. It he food was so hot that u couldn't even touch it. Never have I ever gotten delivery that was super hot.  It was SO good ;-) extremely satisfied with the service and food. Thank you.Worst customer service ever! The manager Jason is very rude and doesn't take ownership for HIS mistakes. Screwed up our orders 2/3 times we've ordered there. Won't be giving them business again!Great pizza and nice drivers, but they have forgotten about $10 worth of sauces now so that's pretty annoying.Love the online ordering ....... order was accurate........ driver was awesome... very smooth and fast......Wow. One of my friends said that Domino's pizza was better than it used to be, it's supposed to be faster than the place I usually go, and the 2-liters are cheaper. The pizza was late by 15 minutes, it was lukewarm, the sauce was the consistency of tomato paste and tasted about as good. I ordered a 12" and couldn't finish three of the tiny pieces that came out of the pizza it was so bad. God. Won't do that again. I'll stick with expensive but edible instead.One would think that all Domino's are created equally.... nope!This one I on the worst list. The location is hard to get in and out of, no fault of theirs though, I get that. But service is lacking big time. Our order took forever and the kid behind the counter looked like he was brand new to life. He argued with us about what we ordered, with the receipt in hand he still argued. Not a single smile or hello when we walked in the door. We felt like we were bothering them. We will likely opt for the other locations from now on.I would give them a zero if I could. The manager hung up on me when I was trying to report an issue. I asked for her direct manager or whoever she reports to and she hung up on me stated that she was closed and she could not assist me. They called me one time, I return the call within minutes, they never bothered to knock on my door. They never even attempted to come into the complex through the appropriate front entrance and returned the food right away leaving us at home hungry. Worst service ever. Hope they enjoy the pizza and chicken they made and never delivered. What a way to make it right, WRONG! I'm disgusted..U could tell the guy who answered the phone was pissed off. He was so rude, rushed me through my order and was frustrated when I had to go back add something to my order. I literally was so blown away with how short and rude he was I canceled my order. No thanks!WORST manager experience ever! We called in a cheese pizza. Literally. Just cheese. The manager was taking the phone calls and hung up on us multiple times! Wouldn't give us our total for delivery. Wouldn't you think it would be beneficial to know your total you're supposed to be paying?! Unreal. Called back multiple times and he actually yelled at us "for being annoying" LOL. Spoke to our awesome delivery driver who said everyone complains about this manager! Denny, Donny, Tommy...something like that. Duh the pizza was great but this manager shouldn't work with the public.
