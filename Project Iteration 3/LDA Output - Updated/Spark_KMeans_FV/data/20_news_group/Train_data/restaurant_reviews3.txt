YASMG!!(Yet Another Strip Mall Gem)3.65 stars.  Not quite a solid 4 but pretty darn close.I like the deliberate decor.  Much more interesting than I expected in a strip mall.  Warm textures and soft lighting as well as exposed brick.The service was predominantly very good.  There was a moment when one of my coworkers received his salad and was surprised that it had cheese.  He hadn't read the menu and it didn't occur to him that a house salad would come with blue cheese.  The waiter was a little put off that he didn't want the cheese on the salad but then returned it and brought out another salad minus cheese.I had the penne ala vodka which came with asparagus, asiago, basil, prosciutto and a nice vodka sauce, portion size was good.Based on my visit I would return to try other selections.***This review is for the bar counter service only***This is a really hard review for me to write....why?  Because I love this place, but last night the service was so bad I have to give it 2 Stars.The Better Half and I enjoy going out to places that offer flights of wine.  We enjoy sampling different vineyards without the cost of paying for a full glass of wine.  Grape Street is our go to place for this.  Normally we dine at a table and enjoy a full meal with our flights.  However, last night we decided to go to the bar because we didn't plan to eat.  It was a mistake.The bartender's service was horrible.  We had to get our own menus.  We each ordered a flight of the Zinfandels and glasses of water.  Once she poured the flights of wine, she didn't bother to tell us anything about the wine.  Normally, they will tell you which glass contains which wine and will give you a brief description of the taste & flavors.  She was more concerned with this guy who was sitting at the bar.  Keep in mind that there was only 5 people at the bar including my Wife & I when we arrived.  Within 20 minutes, there was only 3 of us remaining at the bar.....she spent all of her time chatting up the other customer.  Meanwhile, our glasses of water sat empty.I finished my flight before the Better Half finished hers.....that's always the case.  I was interested in having another glass and was considering one of the Cabs....however, she was nowhere to be found.  The bar was left unattended and who knows where she went.  Finally, she appeared with food for the other customer.  I waited until she delivered his order, then I flagged her down....she says "Just one second".....then she bolts from the bar.....what the ??  I watched her as she walked around the restaurant and she came back empty handed.....what was so freaking important that you couldn't take a drink order from a customer at the bar?  When she finally came over, I asked if I could sample one of the Cabs before I made my decision......she said "sure" and poured me a small sample of the Cab I requested.  Then, she walked away to do something else in the back.....didn't she want to know if I wanted to order a full glass?  Come on!  By this time, the Better Half said screw this.....let's go have a glass of wine somewhere else where we will be served.A server from the restaurant came to the bar, looked over at us and could see we were irritated....asked if we needed anything, I said Check Please.  She went in the back and found the bartender....who came over and said "Didn't you want another glass of wine?"......ha, not tonight and not with your crappy service.  I paid the check and we were on our way to another place.I didn't get the bartender's name, but she had dirty blond curly hair.....I remember who she is because when we come back, I will be sure to avoid the bar if she's working.This place use to be so much better than this.  I don't know what's going on.Will I return?  Yes, but will only sit at the bar if she's not the bartender.  We'll sit in the dining area if necessary.Monday night is a great time to stop by this off-the-strip neighborhood restaurant because bottles of wine are 50% off. The food was better than expected, too. One of their more popular items is baked brie ($13). It's a hunk of brie sitting on top of caramelized onions and wrapped in flaky and delicate pastry. It's a massive baseball-sized mound with a knife piercing the top. It's surrounded by toast, pear, apples, and grapes. This is one appetizer meant to be shared.The mussels ($13) were tough, but the white wine sauce that they were sitting in was phenomenal. Any bread that we had left over was used to sop up every last drop of sauce.The caesar salad was decent and the tomato soup was creamy and full of flavor, but too chilled for my liking.The chicken parmesan ($21) was good, but standard fare. The three thin breasts of chicken were coated in a breading that didn't stand a chance of staying crispy under all the sauce and cheese poured on top of it. A side of spaghetti accompanied the dish.The ribeye special was beautifully charred and still tender and medium rare in the interior. It can't compete with top steakhouses in quality, but the wine and mushroom sauced boldly enhanced the flavor. A few carrots, asparagus, and potatoes surrounded the steak.The restaurant isn't exactly kid-friendly, but there were several kids around, including ours. There's no kid's menu but they were happy to make a plain grilled chicken breast and fries for our little one.On a second visit we started with their tapas plate. The Greek meatballs were the best thing on the plate. Savory and full of bold flavors, I wish there were more than three of them. The other items -- the goat cheese cigars, olives, and vegetables were decent, but paled in comparison to the meatballs.The plating of the caprese salad was different than your typical caprese. The end caps of the tomatoes were sliced off and stacked with mozzarella and topped with toasted pine nuts and balsamic vinegar and olive oil.We shared the short rib entree and the kitchen was nice enough to split the dish on to separate plates. I enjoyed the the depth of flavor of the sauce, although it was a touch sweet. But, the beef was too tough. Add to that a dry, chalky risotto and a minuscule serving of carrots and it was mediocre dish.Service was spotty on both visits. The first time due to our waiter being asked to wait on numerous tables scattered around the restaurant. The second time the waiter and kitchen staff were hanging out at the bar watching a Notre Dame game.Grape Street is a clear notch below the top off-strip restaurants, but it's worth a return visit.3.5 StarsReading through a lot of reviews - I've been surprised at how people have rated this place. This is the first place my boyfriend took me out on a date to and we've come here on a quarterly basis if not more for the last 2-3 years. People say it's too dark...they have lights at every table - it's supposed to be a more chill mood to eat in, and you can see the menus.The only reason I did not give the place 5 stars is because of the service. We've always had good to great service here. I've never had horrendous service in all of the times that I've been here. The only problem I see is that they seem understaffed by 1-2 people. This place gets insanely busy on most evenings and especially on the weekends. The waiters seem to be a bit overwhelmed at times, but never rude. Another thing - people complain it's overpriced. First of all, they have half off wine on Mondays. That's a rarity. And think of all of the other places you drink wine or beer at. Everywhere is over priced for alcohol. They have to, in order to make money. This place does not do anything in the price difference compared to other $$ cost restaurants in town. With the food - come on, guys. It is not overpriced. It is a higher quality than you're going to find walking in any chain restaurant. If you want cheaper prices, go stroll down the street until you find yourself in an Applebees. They offer fresh fish. Not fried fish sticks. The top dishes I recommend - Anything with Halibut or seabass. Most of the times I come here, I get fish - and I'm not a fish lover. But they always have the best sauces that compliment the fish so well. The filet oscar - each time we've had it, it's cooked perfectly to our request, topped with crab and it's served with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It's very flavorful and very tender. The pork chops. I love them here. I'm always scared to get them at restaurants. They never seem to taste right and it's always with weird sauces. The pork chops here are thick, juicy and they have a great sweet wine sauce served on top. I love that they always have a good amount of specials on the board too.I'm pretty sure there isn't anything here that I haven't enjoyed. I've had so much, but there is a reason why we keep going back. AND there is a reason why this place is always busy - IT'S GOOD AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD. ;)Don't let these bad reviews scare you away - try it for yourself.Great service, crab salad is the best but above all dog friendly patio that is covered so our family & friends don't burn.Please see my picture for the reason behind my dislike of this establishment. It shows an apple slice accompanying the Baked Brie with the sticker still on it and sliced through. Is it a big deal? Not for you in your own house, but in a restaurant such as this? Yes, it is a big deal. It reflects poorly on the overall mentality of this place and provides insight into the way they cut corners...1. This apple was likely not washed2. Those that prepare the food are lazy without attention to detail...how was this apple cut through a sticker much less plated without someone noticing and pulling it off??3. If they cut corners here, they cut corners elsewhereAs a result, I was very critical regarding the rest of my meal, here are some additional findings:- the Baked Brie was completely overcooked: the phyllo was an empty shell, what used to be solid brie was now mostly unconstituted liquid fat covering the plate- the pear slices accompanying the Baked Brie were incredibly over-ripe and should not have been served- I also ordered the Penne ala Vodka with chicken which came with pancetta and asparagus pieces in the pasta. I counted, in this dish there was only 1 piece of asparagus which was the tip of a spear, every other chunk was from the body with most being the very fibrous chunks from the bottom (which should not be utilized). I relived my meal on the way home as I tried to excavate asparagus fibers from between my molars.Grape Street - if you're going to charge me $18 for a pasta dish (which is .35 cents worth of pasta + a few chunks of things and sauce), it better be top notch...it wasn't.This place gets an F

Okay, so I'm realllyyyyy freaking picky when it comes to my wings. I don't do Hooters wings. I don't do Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't do Pizza Hut wings. I think I've only had one dozen wings that I went kind of nuts over... and that was yesterday at Long Wong's.Luckily, one of my girlfriends knew how ridiculous I am when it comes to wings but insisted we check this place out. Ghetto area. The girl at the counter wore black lipliner. The customers looked like they just got out of prison...HOWEVER! The wings were out of this world. Saucy, full of flavor, and cheap. Extra veggies, extra ranch... no charge. We ate so many wings + chili cheese fries, and I felt like a heffer when we were done. SUCCESS!

Pepe. Can I call you Pepe? Here's the deal. Salsa squeezed out of a bottle. Not so great. It runs all over my plate making it difficult to scoop up. In a bowl or ramekin would be nice. Chips were good however. Service. Well. Let's just say I had VIP service as I was with three hot Latinas. Yep. Gay gringo + Hot Latinas = stellar service. Excelente!Tamales? Why are they a reddish orangey color? Sad. They were dry, not very sweet (like I imagine Nicole Kidman would be) and well, did I mention sad? The pork filling, however was succulent and tasty. Kinda what I imagine Ryan Reynolds would taste like. My friend's chicken soup was ORGASMIC. Or as they say in Spanish. ORGASMICO. You see. You just add an O and you're bilingual. Order the soup my yelpitas. Be. The soup. And. The margaritas. Well, when you're day drinking and starting at 11:30 am (hey it's 5:00 somewhere, right?) it doesn't take long to catch a buzz. I mean, I''m still tasting my vanilla mint crest with the first sips. But the margs were very smooth, tart and just enough kick.Cut to me floating in my friends' pool after lunch. Happy. Feliz I should say. But wishing I had stuck with my first choice of carnitas or had ordered the chicken soup. Next time. Or. El tiempo proximo. Pepe. I don't care if you're in the hood. I felt so street and edgy. I'll be back. And thank you for commenting on my Hello Kitty debit card Jose! You rawk mi carnes y quesos!If you're looking for the best mole' in town, it might just be hiding at Pepe's Taco Villa.I hadn't been to PTV before (it not really in my neighborhood walking radius...I clock it at just under 22 miles round trip).It might be worth the trip:)I've certainly tried the mole's in a lot of places, and some are pretty decent...I know mole' is a style thing, more than an absolute (the "right" amount of chocolate...the right "umami", etc., so when I say that Los Sombrero's mole' is kind of "mediocre" and the mole' at Frank and Lupe's (which used to be pretty decent) would now be better if they just poured a can of unsweetened Hershey's syrup over chicken tartare...you know I mean those minor critiques with love:)I played squash on Saturday...(squash, the sport of the privileged and effete East Coast elite intelligentsia, who would be dismayed (to put it mildly) to find me playing "their" game:)I played in an event to raise money to make squash an Olympic sport in a few years (yeah, I know...good luck with that, but if they have fencing, why not?)After playing for over an hour straight (best anaerobic sport on the planet...burns more than 1400 calories an hour)...I was hungry!My erstwhile opponent, Wes, the affable and probably not corrupt attorney, suggested PTV. Wes's wife went to high school with the owners and he said they had great mole's.3 chicken mole' enchiladas later, I am inclined to agree. Wes and the family (I'm like an uncle to those kids...Uncle Buck:) chatted with Jose, one of the owners, when we arrived and I got a chance to say "hello" too.I got a little bit of the history of the place...used to be owned by the parents, used to be smaller and more intimate (something I always like in a taco shop...PTV isn't small any longer).We got chips and salsa...pretty good chips and better salsas, although the 2 kinds of salsa came in squeeze bottles (I am really more of a "dunker" than "squeezer" when it comes to salsa...it was fine...you just have to make a little volcano of both kinds of salsa and use 2 chips to push things around...but I don't really like to have to work the chip thing that hard:)The enchiladas came and heavens to murgatroid, they were tasty!!! Pronounced chocolate flavor, not too salty, with the just the right amount of bitterness from the unsweetened Mexican chocolate:) The chocolate blended with the grilled chicken flavor and the sweetness of the corn tortillas to produce an outstanding enchilada. I also ordered the Olla beans...highly recommended! You can get refries anywhere and I doubt that PTV's are significantly (or any) better than others. But they put a bunch of jalapeno's in the pot to make these pot beans a cut above the rest:)They say that chocolate accesses the same brain chemistry that sex does, and I think that might have been the case with my enchilada's:)But, I was there with Wes and his family...they were kind enough to invite me along and show me where to get good mole'...a full on foodgasm would have just been wrong...even for me:)ode to a Chilaquiles.so i ate some Chilaquiles at Pepe's the other morning. not ever having Chilaquiles before i was not sure if my Chilaquiles was good or great, but the Chilaquiles was good to me. very tasty Chilaquiles that is. i had my Chilaquiles with hard fried eggs because i'm not a fan of runny yoke. my Chilaquiles egg was only 85% to my requested hard fried, resulting in a missing star. tho my Chilaquiles was very good. my Chilaquiles was made with a tomatoes salsa texture of sauce..watery in a way..but not knowing how Chilaquiles should look..i thought it was good. Chilaquiles.the tortilla chips are also good. and i kinda liked the squeeze bottles. cause i just squeeze it onto a chip and put it in my mouth. tasty salsas..i squirted a bunch onto my Chilaquiles egg that wasn't fried enough..so i didn't notice the runny texture. Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles. the beans with my Chilaquiles had white cheese on them, alot of mexican restuarants use a handful of yellow cheese so i was impressed..it wasn't crumble queso-fresco..but it was still tasty with my Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles.ok i think i have used Chilaquiles eighteen times now..umm ok nineteen times...so to finish off with an even twenty...Chilaquiles. yummm. ohh btw they take bank cards now.When I worked on the west side, I would pass by a small Mexican import store every day on my way to work. I knew it was there from the random Mexican furniture displayed on the sidewalk. I never thought in a million years, I would ever actually step foot into that place, but then one day my boss at the time took me to lunch and yes, we ended up at Pepe's. The Mexican furniture lined the sidewalk as I approached the restaurant, and I'm not sure if it's attached to Pepe's or just conveniently located next door, but it definitely adds to the authenticity of the restaurant. This is truly a restaurant where you can't judge it by its cover and questionable location on the outside. Once you step foot inside, it's a fun and divey little Mexican food shop. Prices are extremely low and the food is good. The salsa has a nice kick to it and the food is pretty high in calories but also high in taste. I like Pepe's for a decent west-side option for lunchtime. It's a quick, tasty and cheap option for a sit-down restaurant. The Mexican decor on the walls adds to the experience and I could just as easily be in a little restaurant in Cabo instead of being in a restaurant on Camelback and 21st Ave. This is definitely a spot worthy of checking out if you're in the area during lunchtime and looking for a tasty lunch time treat.

Review Text :
Park Road Shopping center isn't like most strip malls.  Instead of boring, ubiquitous businesses like Subway and Sally's Beauty Supply, Park Road offers an eclectic collection of local restaurants, toy stores, book stores and other boutiques.  Sometimes it feels like walking back into the 1960s, but honestly that's part of the charm.No business personifies this more than the Carolina Soda Shoppe.  From great burgers and shakes to fried okra and applesauce, the menu has something for everyone's taste.  The restaurant is tiny with maybe 10 tables in total.  That said, I've never seen it so busy that I've had to wait very long.This place is definitely a local business; its owner clearly attends a nearby church and has prominently placed what I would call "Christian Kitsch" throughout the establishment.  There's even a sign up front that says if you bless your food you'll get a treat.  I'm not religious but if I can pray my way to a milkshake, sign me up.The food is good; not spectacular, but good.  The burgers are not the best but they're darn tasty.  It definitely hits the spot when all I want is a cheeseburger and some fries.  I highly suggest trying the fried okra as well.I was going to give three stars because this place is so low key and "average", but honestly it's not trying to be anything else.  If you're expecting a high-end diner, go somewhere else.  If you want good, simple food at a comfortable local joint, this is your place.

Review Text :
Thai Grill and I have a long history.  Starting nearly five years ago, I started eating authentic Bangkok-style Thai food here on a weekly basis.  Some of you might remember Pock and his family's unique, gourmet Thai food during that time.  About a year ago, ownership changed, and the food changed... starting the beginning of this year there is yet a new owner with new recipes, especially Northern and Southern Thailand recipes.  Here is my updated review for Thai Grill over several visits.Pad See Ew - Fresh Chinese broccoli, fairly well prepared chicken.  The sauce is a little heavier than it used to be, and slight bit sweeter.  However, it is still a good version of this classic Thai dish.  I would say that it compares to the style of Pad See Ew at Kung Fu.Pineapple Fried Rice ($9.99) - Very well done.  Lighter, and a little less flavorful than the old Thai Grill fried rice, but not greasy at all.  They started using fresh pineapples again, which gives the dish the properly fruity-sweet flavor that it is supposed to have.  I enjoyed it.Kang-Pa, Jungle Curry ($8.99) - A Northern Thai spicy fish sauce curry soup (no coconut) with bamboo, various peppers, galanga, choice of meat, and a whole lot of taste.  This is a very authentic curry, and I loved how th curry flavor mixed with the fish sauce.  I haven't had a lot of Northern Thai dishes, but this was definitely much nicer than the Northern Red Curry at LoS.  I wouldn't recommend this for folks who aren't adventurous, but if you are then this is a great dish to try.Hung-Ley ($8.99) - This is a pork base with a homemade curry (not coconut curry) type sauce on it.  The pork was cooked similar to pot roast.  It was extremely tender, and expertly prepared.  The taste over rice was amazingly great.  I highly recommend trying this one.Duck Noodles (10.99) - This came with a regular egg noodle, duck, Chinese broccoli, and various herbs.  The broth reminded me of pho, and wasn't spicy at all.  I added some chili powder to spice it up, and it probably could have also benefited from the sour sauce in hind sight.  The duck was well prepared.  Overall I would order this again for people who aren't into the stronger tasting Thai dishes.Nam-Tod (8.99) - This is a deep fried pork dish over a vinegary sauce and light salad.  The fried pork was flaky and simply amazing.  I am not a huge fan of fried foods, but the way the pork was prepared was simply amazing.  If you like to explore, try this one out.  The vinegar sauce was not overpowering, and was well balanced (unlike most vinegar sauces at Thai restaurants).  You can tell that the cook knows how to balance flavors properly. Red Curry w/Beef ($7.99) - So far my only real disappointment, if you could call it that, but it wasn't that bad compared to most Thai restaurants in Vegas.  This is the first coconut based curry I have had here.  It had a light, but unique flavor.  It definitely could have used more umph to it though.  the server promised that the curry can be made spicier for us next time.  With some chili powder though, it was still a good curry.Khao Soi ($7.99) - YUM!  This has fresh, yummy noodles, and a well balanced yellow curry.  I loved their version of the dish.  It comes in a huge bowl, so it is bound to fill you up.  The best part about this dish is the yellow curry, which is rich and flavorful (not sweet).  Desserts - the Fried banana and sweet sticky rice are perfect.  I've only had "better" fried banana at TSNH, but even that is a toss up... these were very lightly fried, which made them easier on the stomach than TSNH.  The sweet sticky rice (with or without mango depending on the season), is again expertly prepared.  The sweet coconut based sauce saturates the rice, making it very sweet (not candy sweet though), but somehow doesn't make the rice soggy.  You've got to try this one if you are a fan of this classic Thai dessert.Final thoughts: the new cook, Natta, knows how to balance Thai food, and at the same time keep it strong and unique.  The food is about as authentic as it gets.  The menu is absolutely huge, featuring different regions of Thailand; you are bound to find a dish that you have never heard of/tried before.  I will definitely return on a regular basis!UPDATE/WARNING: In my opinion, Thai Grill has two modes: Slightly Americanized, and Authentic.  The Americanized versions aren't bad at all.  The main thing is that the base recipes are well done.  Some people might not like the added sugar/toned down Thai flavors of the Americanized versions.  If you are one of those people, be sure to tell your server to make the authentic, strong stuff!

I am completely amazed that I am the first one to be reviewing this place.A one of a kind deli. The sandwiches are enormous with very unique round rolls, deli meats & cheeses plus they have some of the best soup around.They also have pizzas,wraps and salads.I usually get a roast beef & cheese sandwich and Wisconsin cheese soup with chips & a drink plus tip under $20.The have a dozen or so tables inside and a drive thru so eat in or take-out. Good Eats!I'm a long time Schlotzsky's fan. Been eating her since I was a kid and I still love it. It's funny because until a few years ago I didn't realize that I much prefer sourdough bread... so that probably explains why I love this place. My favorite is the turkey, original style but with only turkey (no pork) Every once and a while I'll get the one with avocado... but honestly the regular sandwich is so good I don't think it needs anything extra. I'm also thrilled that the location by my work carries China Mist Passion Fruit Black Tea (my absolute favorite iced tea) I love it!!!The chip selection leaves a little to be desired, but I'm not coming here for the chips. Staff at this location is always extremely helpful and patient... I'm usually ordering for several co-workers and don't always have my ducks in a row.I can't remember ever having sampled a Schlotzky's sandwich before this summer, but I heard my friend extoll their virtues many times as we planned our trip to Las Vegas.  She insisted we HAD to eat at a Schlotzky's before we left.  We were staying down on the strip, but we used our Yelp app to locate this Schlotzky's and guide us here.The first thing I noticed upon entering were the bright red paint on the walls. It really is quite striking at first.  There was a television in the corner, and this sandwich shop is jam packed full of tables.  They were definitely trying to maximize the usable space.The next thing I noticed was a neon sign proudly declaring that their bread is baked fresh daily.  That's certainly a good sign.  I walk up to the counter to peruse the menu and order.  I decide that I MUST try the Albuquerque Turkey sandwich (ha ha that rhymes) sandwich consisting of smoked turkey breast, crispy strips of bacon, mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan cheeses, fire roasted veggies, lettuce, tomatoe, chipotle mayo - are you drooling yet? - on a freshly bakes Jalapeno cheese bun. OH YEEEEEEEEAH!  It was the perfect sandwich to introduce me to Schlotzky's and I must say I immediately became a fan.I grabbed a bag of chips - oooooooh, excitement, they have two different flavors of baked chips, regular and barbeque.  I head over to the soda fountain to get a drinkzsky (their cutesy term, not mine).  Bummer, the only diet soda option is Diet Coke, but they do have three kinds of tea: passion fruit, unsweetened, and Southern sweet tea.Last cutezsky note: There is a sign on the wall announcing that they do catering "we're haulin bunz" and the restrooms are labeled "manly bunz" and shapely bunz prompting me to contemplate what one does if they have shapely man bunz?Enquiring minds want to know!

Dumpy little place with killer food. I tried the sesame chicken lunch special. It was hot and sour soup, egg roll, white rice and lightly breaded chicken covered in brown sauce and sesame seeds. There was not one thing that was bad. It was all good. Under $7 bucks out the door.Maxim is the perfect spot to get your soup on. I've been a few times this year and usually get cravings on days when the weather is cool or rainy.  On our most recent visit, we were running late, actually they had just turned off the "open" sign. However, when the owners noticed our disappointed faces they waived us back in along with a couple behind us who were just as happy to receive the same treatment.  This alone secures a few stars for feeding us after hours.  Thanks Maxim!On this visit, we had a heaping bowl (shared by two) of wonton noodle soup that allowed for seconds. The soup contained pork, shrimp and stuffed wontons. The broth was tasty and the noodles cooked perfectly.  I've yet to try a soup meal that wasn't excellent. Our second item was the pork and shrimp pancake which I especially like and order every time. It's more like a stuffed crape than a pancake and is very good.  Each meal was served with loads of salad items such as lettuce, cilantro, lime, mint and jalapeños.  You can add these to your meals along with any of the condiments at the table. Yes, they have Sriracha! Other items I've enjoyed that have me returning time after time are the spring rolls and the Pho. The Pho is insanely good. The portion is huge so share with a friend.The only thing that's a little off is the music that's played while dinning. The music was serenading cats meowing. At first I thought it was crying babies but nope, cats.  This is an interesting feature that will take some getting used to, for me at least. Enjoy!writing this review is so tiresometo switch things up and blatently plagiarize a yelp friends writing style im going w/ a rating systemwith a sliding scale of 1-10 ten obviously being the best, 1 the worst:8 food2 service3 ambience9 pricei was thoroughly prepared to enjoy maxim, and while the food didnt disappoint, the unabashed contempt the server/owner? showed me was regrettable. I enjoyed my Pho, it was delicious...well i think technically it was Mi but i digress- the soup was stellar. A large bowl of egg noodles floating in a golden pork based broth, healthy portions of chicken shrimp and some type of spongy pork meat , fresh veggies and herbs to infuse the soup w/ an abundance of flavour. it was delicious, simply put. But. but but but but; the minute i walked up to the door i was greeted with seeming hostility. to note the door was locked, and the open sign turned off, this at 4:20 ish? i checked the hours on the window, checked my cell phone, and looked back at the two little asian women inside in confusion and charming befuddlement. The younger lady, begrudgingly stopped her sweeping and unlocked the door, "you eating here?!" she barked, "whaa, uhh yeah. are you guys open" she glared at me and held the door open. I stood there akwardly and she grabbed flatware and ushered me to my seat, whereupon she actually pulled out my seat for me (actually a kind hearted gesture now that i think about it). i sat and waited, ordered spring rolls (hard to mess up, but they were awesome to note) and my soup. yada yada the meal comes i eat it in quiet enjoyment. a group of four comes in, and then another group, and after that i was ignored the remainder of my stay. i was ignored for soooo long. i sat in quiet frustration/agony waiting for my bill, and a container for the remainder of my soup. after about 30 minutes she deigned to look at me, and acknowledge that i was ready to leave. i ask for the bill and a container. she gives me both, and as i was slowly pulling out my wallet, she stood there and stared. i tried to sign the bill as slow as possible, so that she wouldnt see that i was going to stiff her on her tip, so she picked up my soup and poured it into the container all the while watching my signature out of the corner of her eye, almost bullying me into tipping her, which i did, reluctantly. All in all.....i would come back, but only for a to go order.

I very much wavered between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. I opted for 3 mainly due to the sheer entertainment value that it provides and lately the service has been much better than it used to be. A nice takeout fast food pizza joint that I am old enough to remember back in the 1980's serving square pizza. Those days are long gone and what now puts them on the map is $5 large pepperoni pizzas available "Hot 'n Ready" for immediate pickup and a great last minute family dinner value. For $3 more you can opt for the "Three Meat Treat" or Deep Dish, but I recommend calling ahead for those as they are often not available for immediate pickup. This restaurant was largely remodeled a while back and now has dark wood fixtures and displays. The staff is young and not particularly customer friendly but adequate and efficient. It is often entertaining when you call or walk in as you can often hear and see the kids yelling at each other over various things. Oh to be young again...I've been a customer of this Caesars for years and must say that service has improved greatly. There was a time when it would be busy and even after calling ahead, you could expect a half hour to 45 minute wait time. That seems to be alleviated now as I always call ahead and my order is usually available for pickup upon arrival. Overall, I recommend this place for a quick value pizza and a particularly efficient last minute dinner choice for the family. Just remember to call ahead to be safe.

I've been to the Aladdin's in Mt Lebo and the North Hills and been totally unimpressed.  When my friend wanted to come here, I was over it.  However, this Aladdin's was a good experience.I ordered a falafel wrap ($8.31 with tax) since I had previously been unimpressed with options including meat.  The wrap was awesome.  The falafel was delicious and hot, and it was balanced well.  In Pittsburgh, this is probably the best falafel you can get.  The hummus was also amazing, and I could probably eat it with just a spoon.Overall, a good place for lunch in Squirrel Hill.

good breakfast. just moved to the area and found this place online.  seems like some trucker diner you'd find off the interstate, but inside was nicely remodeled, and food was awsome for breakfast.  most amazing fluffy and huge pancakes.  ommelete and hash browns were nicely prepared, not greasy and filling, but just the right touch of butter.  service was stellar.Your major is sociology and the assignment is exploring idiosyncrasies of various counter cultures. But you procrastinated when the professor was doling out the choices. Now there are only two left. Rednecks and Bikers.You choose the former, but now comes the dilemma. Where in Phoenix can you study rednecks in their natural habitat? (bars and brothels excluded)Well look no further. Kay's is your first stop. Kay's is located in an industrial section of Phoenix surrounded by farms, nearby cattle ranches and all around shit.Surrounded by junkyards, (replete with junkyard dogs) - packs of wild dogs roaming the streets and a gigantic garbage dump next door -  Kay's offers the finest in redneck watching.Yes,the people who harbor these dogs, drive combines, milk cows, and do garbage dumpy stuff all light here, at Kay's.Yes, Kay's will deliver that down-home atmosphere you're seeking, that is, if down home happens to be the back woods of West Virginia.Home to the dentifrice challenged, Kay's is where men wear Wranglers, Roper boots, and all things Carrhart. No fancy jeans here.Here you'll find men whose musk isn't Old Spice or Axe, but Dow Chemical's #105 or Union Carbide's Weevil 'B Gone. Go inside, take a seat and eavesdrop on the next table, let's get started with that assignment, shall we?Redneck breakfast-goer:  "N  I told that little brown puke, this here's Amerca boy, 'n if you don't like it,you can gettttt  the fuuuuckkkk out!, you lil rice-eatin, bean-fartin motherfucker."Redneck's little buddy:  "N  whad he say Earll?"Redneck:   "Lil sumbitch jumped in his '64 Impala 'n made tracks, probably fer Me-hee-co." Little buddy:  "Sposin you tol him Earll."I love going to Kay's for breakfast, but never lunch, even though their lunch specials are to die for. Especially the cheeseburger - one of the best in Phoenix.The breakfasts,especially if you get there around sun up when you'll get to see all these scourilous knaves in their natural habitat, sipping coffee, wolfing lumberjack specials even Denny's would envy, are the total shit!I typically get a bowl of cream of wheat and a couple poached eggs. It comes to nine bucks with coffee and the tip. A little pricey but not when you consider you're smack dab in the middle of a cornucopia of societal throwbacks.Well worth it. I love going to Kay's. Listening in on the conversations. Wondering just how it is Phoenix managed to adopt a little piece of Appalachia in its own backyard.And being a part of a contra culture Jeff Foxworthy would drool over.Note: I should probably mention the owners are nicest folks you'll ever meet and, there are a lot of police in here too. Police must identify with rednecks I suppose.One more thing.Since I gave you the tip on Kay's, I expect to be included in your footnotes.

"I Like Big Buns and I can't lie" I Saw A Nice Pair of Buns at Original Wineburger.   they are toasted and shinny, check the website for your self, if you a bun guy like me.  The Owner told me that he has one location and is not affiliated with any of the other Wineburgers.      I knew i was in for a real hamburger that I can't make at home.  Im very skeptical of the next burger spot since there's ten's of thousands of places offering the same promise of a great burger.What stands out, the size the there burger is inviting and all the ingredients were fresh.The place was packed when I entered and now I know why.  Its a cool look, the bar has the stove right behind it so its like your in a kitchen and bar at the same time.  Original Wineburger has truly stood the test of time and continues to please its customers with a great burger.  I m ready  to go back to order more of the items, the price is set to what you want, know I see why it starts at a moderate price and skyrockets, an $20 burger, anyone else have the confidence to sell at this price?  PS Mr. One star, one star review named  LAry,1.0 star rating2/6/2012"F*cking Terrible - Got Sick as Dog After Eating there Food"1st of all your Language, uncalled for, and I'm not a qualified grammar police but the use of "there" i think you wanted to say  to be their?

Review Text :
What do you do after a four mile hike?  Try a new place for lunch with your hiking mates.  This is what landed us at Bob Taylor's Ranch House late this morning.Two of us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I'd make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.For dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it's huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.Service was terrific--perhaps because we were the only people in the restaurant.  I have a feeling that our server would have been almost as attentive if there had been 5 tables occupied.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.After all the years of seeing the signs for this place or seeing ads, I'm glad we gave it a try.  I have a feeling that when we hike Mount Charleston and add lunch to our rigors, we'll stop here again!This is an old time restaurant that has some charm.  I have been a regular at this place for years, but I have noticed that the last year or so the management and owner simply don't care any more.   The cooks can't get the temperature of a steak right and always try to make you feel that you don't understand the difference between mid rare and mid well.  I normally go to the restaurant for their prime rib, which used to be in my opinion the best in town.  The problem now is that they try to pass medium as rare.  The cooks attitude is horrible and as I said the owner is never there and nobody cares except for a couple of servers that are helpless to do anything.Their lunches have gone down hill as well. This place has no charm left and is not worth spending your money at.This ended up being Plan B after the debacle that was "Bastille Day" at a restaurant that rhymes with "Barche Macchus" when they offered to seat us in a storage room.  I've had this place bookmarked for 3 years and it was finally time, baby!Bob Taylor's Ranch House is a throwback in so many ways from the cowboy decor, to the music and even menu.  Just the entrance itself is photoworthy!  I felt like I was at some roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Seeing the chef turning all those steaks as the hostess walked us to our table had me salivating big time!We got the cajun shrimp appetizer which was just ok.  While the flavor was nice, the shrimp was a little on the small side.  We still ended up soaking up all the sauce with the complimentary "garlic cheese toast".  The wife got the filet (rare) and I got the bone-in ribeye (medium rare) after much encouragement from our friendly waitress.  The ribeye was a massive 24 oz's of which I was only able to finish half of.  I usually prefer rare steaks but when it comes to the ribeye cut, I prefer it a little more cooked so I can appreciate all the parts of it from the outside char to the tender center and everything in between.  $42.99 for a ribeye seems cheap these days haha.  The filet mignon was very tender with great flavor. All entrees come with your choice of soup (it was a not bad lobster bisque) or salad (avoided based on Jade's review of it being IHop-esque) and a side. I got the twice baked potato only because I wanted the cook to work a little instead of paying for a baked potato which requires really no work at all.  My wife got the ranch house potatoes which could only be described as crazy hash browns.  No $12 a la carte sides items like 16 miles away from here!Somehow got coerced into getting dessert and was brought the biggest slice of chocolate cake I'd ever seen.  I enjoyed all 3 bites I had before shoving that into the third takeout box of the evening.Considering how ticked off my wife and I were for things not going as planned that evening, this was a very welcome surprise.  I am a big fan!  Not sure I would go out of my way to make it back here but this would certainly be on the top of my list when I am back around these parts.SO glad we had dinner here :)First it started with with my dinner salad. So tasty and fresh.I ordered the petite filet which was $27.99 (8 oz). I had them put some bleu cheese on top and it was so good. It came with cheesy bread and a twice baked potato. That potato is reason enough to go back!The meat is mesquite grilled. As you walk in and get seated by the hostess you walk right by the grill. The service was excellent.I saw on the menu they also offer take out service so if you want to just phone your order in and pick it up you can do that too. I think I will try that out with a salad and soup for lunch someday. They also host weddings and office, birthday, anniversary parties. They show all the Steelers games here too according the the server.OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...There are not many "old" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an "Old Western Vegas" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.Service: 4 starsKitch: 4 starsFood: 1 starI will never set foot in this place again! Worst service ever! Waited 25 minutes to even get noticed by the server. I was so excited that I was finally going to try this place out since I drive by it all the time and wanted a place that served some prime rib. Total disappointment when we were seated, no one approached my fiance and I. After seeing this family get service before us I was like "oh hell no, that did not just happen." I went to the hostess to tell her we've been sitting here for 20 minutes and no one has approached us, not even a drink order or anything. I wanted to walk out! She finally got the server but the server did not apologize for the wait or anything (this place wasn't even packed). She asked for our drink order and I told her we've been ready to order. I ordered the prime rib with the twice baked potato. It was okay!  Bob Taylor's Ranch House you totally disappointed me!If you like mesquite grilled steaks look no further. Bob Taylor's Ranch House is the place! My wife has been coming here for years and introduced me to the Ranch House. Now my Dad who recently retired and moved here frequents the Ranch House too. We made reservations for Christmas dinner and were really happy with our meal. I ordered the Ranch House Wings to start out with and I could smell the vinegar tickling my nostrils as it was brought to the table. Funny thing is they tasted nothing like vinegar and I liked that. They were meaty and tasted good. My dinner came with a choice of either soup or salad. The soup was Lobster Bisque and that wasn't going to work for me. My wife suggested that I just try the salad so I did. I ate every bite of my salad it was so damn good. Every piece of lettuce, which was crisp and not a pile of leaves or weeds, had dressing on it. When my Porterhouse arrived I was a happy boy. It was cooked just how I ordered it. The steak was juicy and tender. My twice baked potato was hot and good. For dessert I had a Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae. The brownie was so soft and hot. I liked everything about my meal and it was a great Christmas Dinner. There is also a lunch menu if you want to try a burger or other sandwiches. The French Dip is made with their smoked prime rib and is mouth watering.I'm always careful to keep my reviews in context, so let me first point out that even though I'm giving this place a full 5 stars, that should not be construed to mean it is better than the other finest steak houses near the strip.But...if you want to try a old (1955) rustic, homey (was literally a house at one point) place off the beaten path, with simply the finest selection of beef that is expertly prepared at about HALF the price of other places that feature similar beef...then you're going to love it.We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms that were most excellent.  The blue cheese dressing on our salads was home made and was simply excellent.  The garlic cheese bread was delicious.  THEN our meat arrived!  I had the 12oz Filet and my wife had the 16oz Prime Rib.  Both cuts were perfectly cooked on their large open grill and had a flavor and texture rarely experienced (and we go to a lot of nice steak houses...minimum 3/mo).  We finished up with a very good piece of Key Lime pie.I noted that a lot of other people were complaining about service...I guess we just got lucky.  Our waitress could not possibly have been more on top of things.So in summary...this place is not winning any awards for ambiance, but if you want a super fine piece of beef at half the price it would otherwise take, I highly recommend it.  We live in Green Valley about 45 minutes away, so I probably would not make the trip unless I was already out there for some other reason...but with meat that good, I'll probably find that reason.I don't think it can quite be categorized as a staple, but Bob Taylor's definitely has it's history in Las Vegas. Being born and raised here, I've been coming to the Ranch House for as far back as I remember. When I was younger, this was one my mom and stepdads favorite places to go for a steak. I remember when there used to be long waits and lines out the door. But I can't remember when exactly I was here last, I just know it's been a good 15+ years.A few of our friends recently invited us here for dinner when they were craving some "good ole' American meat". When the 5 of us walked in on a Saturday night, there was absolutely no wait. There was a few tables sat inside, and while the decor has remained mostly unchanged from what I remember, the place just doesn't seem to have that Ranch House feel anymore. It's definitely starting to show it's age, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it almost feels more like a chain restaurant now than a mini-getaway from the city like it used too.After browsing the menu for a bit, I decided on a special that there were advertising, a bacon-wrapped 8oz filet, I believe priced at about $35. Much like the regular menu items, it came with a soup or salad, and a potato choice. I chose the lobster bisque, which wasn't great, but according to other reviewers, was likely a lot better than their side salad. It just didn't really have much flavor, and there was no lobster in it. The best part about it was dipping their garlic cheese toast in it, which on it's own wasn't anything special either. Now, I'm the type of person who doesn't believe in eating a steak at anything past medium rare...and with no shame, I'll give you a hard time about doing so. But I think when I ordered my filet medium rare, and just about everyone else at the table ordered there's well done, it threw the kitchen off a little bit. All 4 of our steaks were just off a bit. Mine was cooked much closer to medium, and the well done orders were more like medium rare. Not that I feel too bad for them, since they won't be able to taste anything way, it's always disappointing when your steak isn't done right. Especially mine being over medium rare. Even though I still think the Ranch House uses fairly good quality meat, especially at the price, their execution just isn't there. Alongside the temperature issues, our steaks came with a béarnaise sauce that pretty much ruined the whole thing. It was easily the thickest béarnaise sauce I've ever seen, and had a texture that was more like a dry paste squeezed out of a pastry bag. There was no smoothness to it, it wasn't creamy, and it really didn't taste all that good. Scraping as much of it off as I could helped a bit, but this would have been an entirely different experience if that sauce wasn't there to begin with. There service doesn't have much behind it either. We felt really rushed with our orders, and it took a while to get drink refills too. Our waitress was okay, but she wasn't very friendly, and didn't seem all that interested in waiting tables anymore that night. Maybe nostalgia kicks in a little on this 3 star review, just because I like the place and have been here so many times before as a kid. And as I mentioned, I still don't think their prices are too crazy high for the quality of meat. But the service and kitchen execution resemble more of an Outback or other chain. I might go back eventually, but if it's anything like this last visit, and they've completely lost that homey, local feel with decent steaks to go along with it, the Ranch House would be all but a memory.Items Selected:Lobster BisqueGarlic Cheese BreadHalf-Smoked Chicken with Twice Baked Potato16oz NY Strip with Twice Baked Potato12oz Filet Mignon with Vegetables16oz Smoked Prime Rib with Ranch House PotatoesCarrot CakeWarm Brownie with Vanilla Ice CreamServing Las Vegans since 1955 and apparently a dirt road destination for locals before The Valley extended in all directions towards the burbs, Bob Taylor's Ranch House was chosen for an eveningtime meeting for friends discussing the current boom in local dining, the juxtaposition ironic in how unintentional it actually was when taking into account a setting that has not changed in decades.Located on the verge of Las Vegas and its neighboring city to the North and the sort of place where feral cats are free to roam on premises decorated with grass and a loose-gravel lot, it was just after 7 o'clock that our group of five was seated on the cusp of a dining room that reminisces of days long before most of us were born, the open kitchen to the left with a team of chefs searing a number of steaks, chickens, and chops.Predating the era of artisan purveyors, outlandish sourcing from overseas, and even meats served singularly with sides to be ordered a la carte, it was with conversation and cheap cocktails from the bar that the evening commenced, and soon to be served a basket of Wonderbread topped in cheese and garlic the presentation was actually better than one may have expected, a second basket later delivered free of charge and arguably one of the three best items to arrive on the table that night.No doubt a place more celebrated for its heritage than the items that appear on the plate, it was after an included low bowl of bisque flavored something like lobster that entrees arrived, each offered with a choice of a starch, both the creamy twice baked potatoes and bacon imbued Ranch House iteration competent with the former actually on-par with pricy versions on the Strip while the latter compared favorably to a good breakfast hash.Moving onward to the meats, suffice it to say that the two bites of New York Strip tasted were sinewy enough that fork was subsequently kept to myself and as much as the half smoked chicken may have seemed like a good option for those seeking something lighter, the actual execution was so dry that even dark meat saw one of my tablemates nearly choke when attempting to swallow without water, a veritable disaster of a dish with 2/3 left to waste.Told by a friend that Smoked Prime Rib was really the only thing to order at Bob Taylor's it was in a 16oz cut that $34.95 was sank and although certainly not much to look at both the flavor and texture were complex and ind indulgent, each bite seeing the tender flesh thoroughly permeated with perfume from mesquite that helped offset the heft of melting fat.A lot of food for the dollar, though not exactly a bargain unless one puts a monetary value on experiencing a "classic" in its almost original form, it was in a duo of desserts that remaining appetites were invested, the brownie and ice cream combination really no different than any diner classic while the huge wedge of carrot cake was enough to share around the table, the moist base chock-full of nuts and raisins with cream cheese frosting that came across tangy and only modestly sweet.**  Perhaps a poor choice for dinner the week after doing CUT and Carnevino on back-to-back nights it still warrants mention that the quality of Bob Taylor's Ranch House is really no better than any number of low-to-mid-range chains, the price too high to justify anything other than the smoked prime rib and perhaps a dessert no matter how historic the space.I was  looking for a good steak to try and I was referred to this place by two different people so  I decided to give it a try and take my girlfriend here for something a little different.  I was warned that this was out in the midle of residential homes and the tip was right.  The place has an old school vegas feel to it.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a lady that we presumed to be the owner...Super nice.  The decor is very old and there are photos of old vegas all around the place.  It was empty at first but the restaurant filled up pretty quickly.  The service started off awesome but as the restaurant began to fill up it slacked up a little.  For appetizers we had fried calamari which was the bomb and stuffed mushrooms.  The stuffed mushrooms were some of the best stuffed mushrooms I've had in awhile.  The house salad was not all that great to be honest.  I only had a few bites of it.  I should have gotten the potato soup but since I knew I was getting the twice cooked baked potato I didnt want to overdue it on potato.  I had heard that they had a 32 ounce porterhouse steak and I was dying to try it.  I also heard that if you finished it you get desert for free.  So I ordered the 32 ounce steak medium rare.  It came a little burned and rare in the middle which I could live with. Rare..medium rare....blah blah its all the same to me.  I loved the steak!  I finished it and got the deset for fee.  The carrot cake was some of the best I've ever had before.  Delicious.  If your looking for a new spot to try out and havent been here before I'd definetly try it out.  For me it's not some place I'd go to often because it's a journey out there for me and a little pricey if your paying for two.

Well, this is the real deal when you want a taco or tostada.  It's the EXACT food you will eat in Mexico.  Exact.  I ordered the asada.  Beef on a corn tortilla that is made there-- a real tortilla.  Then you go over to a salsa, quacamole, hot sauce, cucumber, cabbage and radish, onion bar and fix it up how you like.  The 5 stars is for the food, the ambiance and setting is not anything special.  In fact, it is a bit of a turn off , but very clean.  It's in an old Wendy's I think. The food is so delicious, it doesn't matter!!!!!!This place is legit. Don't expect much from the area or the neighborhood. But when you go in the staff is courteous and the place is clean. I was just driving wanting to try something new. I had passed this place several times. But what caught my eye was the painted sign on the window "Birria de Chivo" and Menudo served all week. Wow, most places only serve menudo on weekends. I pulled into the lot and decided to look them up in Yelp to see what if anything others had experienced. Looked good. I ordered 2 days worth of food. The torta de carne asada, and the birria de chivo (shreaded goat meat in a lightly seasoned broth) and a large horchata. She asked if I wanted the torta meal with beans and rice  or just the torta. I replied just the torta. She also provided me with a small sandwich style container for putting in veggies from the salsa bar and said if i needed another to just ask. I helped myself to the fresh sliced cucumbers, radishes, cabbage, wedges of key lime and pickled onions on the bar and filled a few small cups of salsa. The red was spicy with a vinegar base. The green was quite tasty as was the pico de gallo. The birria came with corn tortillas and small containers of fresh onion and cilantro. Again this was served as a caldo (sans veggies) but that is what you toss in the onions, cilantro, lime juice and some salsa. Yum! The torta was huge. Warning it doesn't come dressed. I was expecting the mayo, avocado, tomato to already be on this. But luckily I had picked up all the fixings at the salsa bar to make it work. And boy did it work. The pickled onions, cabbage, pico, avocado crema, salsa verde....Mmmm....

Restaurant name  Capitol Chophouse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Capitol Chophouse is a great reminder of why I generally steer clear of restaurants built in hotels: They're never very good. I'm not certain whether it's because they rely on their built in audience (hotel guests) and don't try very hard, or if it's because there are people like me that expect it's going to be mediocre, but whatever the case, there's only one restaurant inside a hotel I rush to, Cleo inside The Redburry in LA. (Basset Street Brunch Club does a fine job in Madison, too.) I should preface this by saying that I ate here during Restaurant Week, and I feel terrible for saying this, but it's slowly becoming a way for consumers to figure out where NOT to eat during the year, as opposed to Madison Magazine's intended purpose, rousing the community with an array of amazing eats during a season when restaurant owners would love to see you spend some bucks. That said, several restaurants in town do the week up right, Capitol Chophouse isn't on that list. Our server Lee was a knockout, with his incredible knowledge of the menu and some decent wine pairing advice. He was attentive and great for some banter at the table, and if I didn't eat anything, I'd give the place 5 stars simply for Lee. But I did eat, and it wasn't good. And it was expensive. And I don't know why. None of the desserts grabbed me, so I decided not to go with the Restaurant Week menu and ordered a mixed green salad with mustard vinaigrette and the scallops. The amount of salad that arrived was almost comical. I can't tell you what I ate because I was overwhelmed by spinach. The dressing was sparse and lacked flavor and after about ten bites, I gave up. It wasn't interesting. The scallops were also a flop. Seared only on top (which made for a nice presentation, but how do you not sear a scallop on two sides?) I've picked up better scallops at the co-op, and cheaper too! At $32, the dish is restaurant robbery. Some might say I should have stuck with the menu they were offering, but the scallops were a part of that, so I'm unclear how making a larger portion of something they were used to churning out all week as part of their Restaurant Week menu turned out so poor.Although the sides we ordered (asparagus and brussels sprouts) were tasty, my two dining companions didn't think too highly of their meals either, both of them trying steak. The two bottles of wine we split were fine, but with the crazy mark-up, I would have rather we saved some cash and imbibed somewhere after. That was a very expensive $100+ endeavor that I won't be repeating.

Restaurant name  Phat Burrito

Review Text :
It truly breaks my heart to write this review. I am squirming in my seat as I speak, or type I guess. I really really really want to love Phat Burrito, I mean, really. It just isn't the same anymore and I can't hold on any longer. I love the location, I love the decor, I love the murals, or "pieces" in urban terms, and the overall charm that emits from this place. The restaurant is super cool, hip, eclectic and is a spot where regulars don't need a menu (if you can find it). Phat Burrito brings me back to the days of b-boying and ya know, my ghetto youth. It's just, what's all that charm without good food? I'm not all superficial. I appreciate a little substance and I've given Phat Burrito enough chances to love me back. Each visit just seems to get worse, and today's lunch was a kick in the nuts. Now, the fish taco was good; grouper, charbroiled on an optional CORN tortilla (yay) and topped with a mango salsa. Yep pretty yumm. Tortillas are grilled rather than steamed, which I adore. The burrito though was another utter disappointment. The beans were al dente - hard. Rice was bland and soggy, thus making my burrito wet and causing it to crack in half. The chicken was bland and dry. Every other bite was hard with a few burnt pieces. While the portions are nice, the burrito as a whole was just lacking something; flavor. Mediocre IMO. I've practically tried everything on the menu (not hard to do), but my heart belongs to chicken. But when the chicken continually does you wrong, whats a fellow to do now but move on to the next one.

This is perplexing! How have I yet to write a review for Marigold?Doesn't matter if it's breakfast, brunch or lunch I always enjoy my time at MK. To be honest (look out) it's my favorite in the Sardine/Gates&Brovi/Marigold food empire. Staff is so darn pleasant, they have an efficient way of keeping people moving, and their specials are always mouthwatering interesting. During Chanukah this past year they were frying up latkes that were bomb! On their normal menu I love the scrambler with sausage and you can't go wrong with the french toast. Holy cow it's good. I want to continue to work my way through the menu because I have some stand-bys that I continue to go back for time and time again. They're just so good!One of the best brunches in Madison can be had at Marigold Kitchen.For you Chicagoans, this place is remarkably similar to Birchwood Kitchen--from the setup (placing your order at the register and then having staff deliver your food), to the menu, which features classics as well as eclectic items. And everything is homemade, right down to the mayonnaise used in their sandwiches.Marigold is a busy place, serving breakfast, brunch, and lunch, but they manage to keep everything moving smoothly. It seems to be a very well-oiled machine.We went for brunch, and the menu had so many great choices that I kept changing my mind; should it be the artichoke, oven-roasted tomato and asiago cheese omelette, the duck confit hash, the French toast with berry puree, or the "scrambler"? Man, I tell you, everything sounded mouthwatering. And what's this? $5 breakfast cocktails made with fresh-squeezed juices? Now I had to decide between a mimosa, greyhound, screwdriver, or bloody mary. Life is hard.I went with the "scrambler," an egg dish mixed with sautéed cremini mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes, and pesto cream cheese. It was fanfreakingtastic on its own, but then it comes with Marigold potatoes and French rosemary toast. I did think the potatoes were a tad greasy, but overall they were delicious. But what's up with places that are too scared to toast bread so that it has some actual color? I want toast, not hard bread that makes me feel like I'm eating something stale instead of toasted. Don't be afraid to get some brown on that bitch!My trusty dining companion enjoyed an omelette with zucchini, roasted red peppers, goat cheese, and parmesan. I was able to sneak a bite and can report that it too, was a solid choice.We sat on the patio as we drank our perfectly spicy bloody marys and iced lattes and watched the people and pups stroll by. What a great place. I'm jealous of people that live in Madison.I am so coming back here. After all, I haven't even tackled the lunch menu. I spied a turkey and artichoke grilled cheese, warm spiced squash salad and a chutney chicken salad sandwich. And that was just the first page of the menu. Let the indecision begin....GET OUT OF THE HOTELThere is one thing I can't stand and it is eating in a hotel run restaurant. Many business travelers eat at a hotel out of convenience. It's close to your room and toothbrush. I like to go outside the box. I can't stand the powdered eggs, lumpy oatmeal, tasteless pancakes, greasy bacon and burnt toast. I need something fresh to start my day. A few years ago I came across this place and they open at 7am. I love getting out of my hotel room and grabbing a table outside here. Luckily the weather has been pleasant on the times I have visited here.  I imagine dinning outside in February would be brutal plus the coffee would freeze. This place is also located down the street from the Wisconsin Capital. There website claims you can hit it with one of there muffins because its so close. Is that a challenge? Plus will you bail me out of jail? I'll wait for a message from you before ever trying that. Ha! (On a side note...Dear Gov Walker I would never do that...I was just adding humor to my Yelp Review)I've tried a few things on the menu, over the years. I do love grabbing a fresh brewed coffee and/or a fresh squeezed OJ. I've also tried the breakfast egg sandwich and the omelette with ham & gruyere cheese on several different occasions. Both breakfast items were delicious. Also the eggs they use are farm fresh and organic. You can really taste the freshness plus its good for you.  I have never tried the lunch menu because I'm usually stuck working but the breakfast is good here. It is places like this that make my travels fun. It is always exciting to find a delicious new fresh place to eat on the road. The sad part is leaving Madison, after my work is done and then heading home. I never know if I will ever come back and visit, until work sends me this way...the good thing is that Madison is not too far from Chicago, so I can always take a road trip. If you're in your Madison hotel room reading this at breakfast or lunch (they close at 3pm on weekdays and 2pm on weekends), then it's time to sneak by the crappy breakfast lobby bar and get some real fresh food. The walk over will be pleasant and the capital building is a beautiful building to look at too. Once you arrive, then grab a nice table and start your morning out right.Madison Magazine got me again!  After a spread on the 13 best pancakes in Madison I had no choice but to accept the mission before me.  Our first stop?  Marigold Kitchen!  I have had this place bookmarked for a while and was happy to finally get the chance to visit it.  There was tons of parking and the location was easy to find, well after the GPS got involved. Upon entering the restaurant I noticed that there was what they called 'seating etiquette' which basically said, order with the cashier  then you'll be guided to your seat.  Though this place was jam packed we were able to order right away and did not have to wait to find a seat.  I ordered the blueberry and apricot pancake with bacon as that was the item featured.  Well let me tell you, this place sure did not disappoint.The pancakes do not look like much just 3 smallish/medium pancakes with a few blueberries on top and a slice of almond butter. Man!  Those pancakes were pretty incredible!  They were really light and just freaking good.  I also ordered the bacon which was good as well, not as standout as the pancake but still good.I am really looking forward to coming back to this place.  The layout is a bit crammed but in a really cute way.  They also have an awesome menu, I already know what I'm going to try when I go back.  If you haven't been to this place, do yourself a favor and go!  You won't be disappointed.Madison no doubt has some of the best egg sandwiches out there. I'd only ever had McDonald's egg mcmuffin (a zillion years ago, mind you), so perhaps my expectations weren't all that high. But my oh my, Marigold Kitchen's egg sandwich is one of the best I've had since moving to Madison a year ago. Would of gotten five stars had the bacon been cooked a little longer.For a side I purchased potatoes, which I generally would douse in ketchup - but there was enough flavor where, dare I say it, my favorite condiment was not necessary. Tried the Peppermint Mocha with Soy. Not a fan. Boyfriend enjoyed the coffee, but wished there was more of a selection rather than just one Regular or Decaf carafe. The unlimited refills made up for his griping, though.I think the thing that stands out for me from Marigold is the service. Yes, the have absolutely delicious food and the coffee is great. The atmosphere is cozy-casual, but man, the service made the experience for me.I have an aversion to onions. I don't have an allergy, but I do not like them in any form, not raw, not caramelized, not pickled, no way, no how do I eat onions. And at Marigold I want to order the breakfast sandwich which comes with a fried egg, cheddar-spiked boursin, applewood smoked bacon, tomato and green onion on toasted ciabatta. I asked for no green onions. While they aren't on my strict no-onions list I still choose not to have them when possible. However, they were mixed in with the cheddar-spiked boursin and therefore not removable. I hemmed and hawed but the man at the counter said it would be good and if it wasn't he would give me something else so I took it.I ended up eating about half of it, not because I didn't like it, but just because I was full. However, the man from the counter came over toward the end of our breakfast and expressed concern about the amount of the sandwich I hadn't eaten. He tried to get me to order something else and apologized if I didn't enjoy my breakfast. I did, in fact, enjoy my breakfast. But, man. The fact that he remembered me and checked in based on how much I ate was really nice. And so, I'd go back for the service if nothing else. But, in reality I'd also go back to try the pancakes because those looked fantastic.THIS JUST IN: You can get a short stack! WHAAAAAAAA? I'm constantly overwhelmed by the sweet their pancakes punch, but get this, you can get a wee stack of two for a few buck when typically the larger portion runs $10. SOLD! Does it say this on the menu somewhere? It's possible. But you're reading Yelp, and now you know, so you don't need to eye over the menu closely. Simply peep the chalkboard, decide that the special pancakes are the best being offered, then grab a short stack!

The food was good, but it doesn't outweigh the management practices. The experience was bordering on a nightmare. Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked. When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our "reservation" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had "little parcels" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars. I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people.Yelp steered us here for brunch, but your only option is a buffet.  And it's not good.My waffle was okay, but the syrup dish had a lot of "skin" that had developed in the tray.  Kinda chunky when pouring it out.The bacon and sausage weren't particularly flavorful.  The "homemade" biscuits were hard.Of all the places we ate in Champaign, this was the worst.  Definitely not worth $20+ for the same kind of Sterno-warmed slop you'd find at Old Country Buffet.Go get a cup of Jarling's Custard and make that your brunch.

I have had good and bad times here. Good times out weigh the bad for sure. Today I used a $15.00 coupon that they sent me for my b-day. I had an 11 oz sirloin med rare wedge salad with blue cheese and chicken tortilla soup. They also serve peanuts and bread before the meal arrives. All the food was excellent, cooked as ordered and perfect flavor. The staff was good, a little slow but the bartender had a large togo order she was finishing up. Another waiter helped her by taking the order. GREAT MEAL especially since it was free. LOL

Review Text :
As a student in Pittsburgh, it seems that Hemingway's is a rite of passage.  To mark the end of my first semester of graduate school, my friend and I came here for some lunch time day drinking after an 8 AM final.  There were quite a few other students in there, mostly undergrads with a head start.  It was not terribly crowded but very loud.Hemingway's has MULTIPLE happy hours.  Yes.  Lunch time from 11 AM to 12 PM happens to be a happy hour with half priced sandwiches!  What?!?!  Instantly impressed.Here are some food thoughts:Jolly Rancher Shot Pitcher ($7)- This had a quite a few shots within it, and I split it with my friend.  It was green apple flavored, but honestly, it was mostly sugar and not much alcohol.  I couldn't even feel the alcohol afterwards.  But the gummy worms in the pitcher were awesome.Buffalo Chicken Wrap (Normally $8.99, $4.50 at happy hour)- The wrap was delicious.  Not too spicy, just right!  Probably one of the best versions of this wrap I've ever had.  I made the mistake, though, of opting for coleslaw over the french fries.  Bad decision.  Get the french fries!!!  They are seasoned and perfection!!!  Massive case of buyer's remorse.  The coleslaw was pretty boring.  Get the french fries.  Trust me.My friend ordered a burger, and it was massive.  At the same price as my wrap, I was totally jealous.  The burger looked and smelled amazing, and I plan to get one when I come back.Service isn't particularly fast, but most people are there to just hang out, so it is cool.  The service was very friendly and good, though.The only odd thing is that if you do NOT order a drink, there is a $1 up-charge.

Review Text :
It's late on a Sunday night and the BF suggests trying out the original Osaka after having visited their second location a few weeks back. Walking through the front door, you immediately face a wall.  Not the most feng shui I'm sure, but make a right down the hall and you'll see another entrance which brings you right to the sushi bar.  I noted to the BF that this location was way smaller, and he then pointed out they had more room in the back.  We took a walk down there after eating to check out their tatami room (lots of space), semi-private booths, and a hibachi grill area too.  They are pretty fancy here with slide shows running on a computer screen at every booth in the back.  I would be even more impressed if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by pressing your selection.  That would be super high tech!  Anyway, back to the review and the food.  The menus are pretty much the same at both locations, for the most part.  From their late night happy hour menu, this is what we ordered:* Shishamo ($2.80) - It came with three pieces.  Again a bit tougher than what I'm used to.  They seasoned it with black pepper, but I asked for some salt to give it a little more kick too.* Korean-Style Spicy Chicken ($4.50) - It's literally stir-fried chicken with Korean spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce.  I wasn't sure if the lettuce was garnish or to eat.  Oh well, I ate it.* Crazy Horse Roll ($4.20) - It's tuna, salmon, masago and mixed together with spicy sauce.  It's a very basic roll, but pretty good.* Fire Roll ($3.90) - Crab meat and spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it looks like the CA rolls you buy from the supermarket, but without the avocado in it.  It had a bit of kick in it.And from their regular menu: * Ankimo ($6.95) - Monkfish liver...oh how I love this stuff.  It's an acquired taste.  I like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauce and then break off a tiny piece and savor each little morsel.  The BF likes to dunk his piece into the sauce and then toss the whole thing in his mouth.  He likes to then mush it around in his mouth.  Haha!They are known for their exotic and colorful rolls, and they can be a bit a pricey.  It's our unfortunate luck that the only two rolls we ordered were so visually boring.  Service: It wasn't too busy this late in the evening.  A handful of people at the bar and few people at the tables.  The BF had to ask for his soda to be refilled and the waitress never came back with his drink!  When he asked for it, the waitress got him another one.  Then a few minutes later, she came by and took his drink away!  (We were wondering why she did that.)  When she came back with his drink, she said she was refilling it again.  (I guess to make up for his drink disappearing in the first place.)  The BF asked for my own pot of tea since I'm a big tea drinker and to save them the trouble of having to refill my teacup every five seconds.One waiter came by twice to take away dishes that we weren't done yet.  In the process, he would try to squeeze in between us to reach for the plate, only to realize there was still food on it.  And finally at the end of our meal when the plate was clearly empty, then he asked if he could take it!  We were amused.  And actually, when we are both done sharing a plate, we actually put it to the side to help them out for that reason - so they don't have to reach in between a couple of lovebirds.  Duh!     Don't forget that you can get a 10% coupon when you visit their website!(Yep, there's pics of our food eats in the business profile!)I stopped writing reviews on Yelp because it was too time consuming, but after eating at this restaurant, I can't help but tell the world about our experience, one that I hope will make other people wary of coming here.We arrived at Osaka on a typical Saturday afternoon (1pm-ish) and was shown a table in the back room (where the tables were larger).  As we walked past the first room upon entering, I noticed that it was fairly empty but it didn't struck me as odd since there are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.We sat down and were given multiple menus, each one with something different in it.  I guess this could be a good thing since I like having lots of choices.  We ordered our drinks (hot green tea and iced green tea) and browsed the menus for omakase, which we heard from someone (ahem) that it is worth coming here for.After everyone in our party arrived (there were 5 of us), we asked the waitress about their omakase and she completely hesitated. I thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question.  She said she'll be right back, so we sat there, thinking maybe she's just new or something.  But even so... o_O.She came back and in broken English asked us if we wanted sashimi or sushi, and we said a little of both.  She then proceeded to say that it's $100 for all four people that wanted it, and I confirmed if it was $100 per person, or if it was $100 for all four people because that makes a HUGE difference.  She said $100 for four people, so we agreed.After ordering the "omakase" - I realized that she must have ordered us the plate of normal sashimi/sushi that was on the menu.  I remember seeing $50 for 2 people for something, so with 4 people, she just doubled it.  I thought sure... why not.  We were going to try their assortment of rolls, but given that the omakase is supposed to be good, I decided to give it a try.The first plate of sashimi came out looking decent.  I'm not too familiar with the names and the translation for the type of fish, so I'm just going to say that I tried just about everything on the menu and only a couple items tasted okay.  There were quite a few nasty bites in between, including one in which I had to spit out.  Now, I'm not a sushi snob at all, but when I have to do that, it means it's NOT good.  My companions agreed, and another person had to go thru that ritual later on in the meal as well (said one of the fish tasted grainy too).  Fortunately, our napkins were right in front of us.  =)As an additional note, we received 2 additional plates of sushi rolls which were supposed to be part of the omakase deal.  We thought it was just so-so as well... perhaps even bad.At the end of the meal, we noticed the $100 + $70 on top of our other charges.  We asked about the $70 and they said it was for the 2 plates of sushi rolls that accompanied our sashimi omakase plate. Needless to say, that $70 was a surprise because we were told  it was $100 for four people.  If they told us they were going to bring additional sushi plates for $35 each, I think we would've either said no, or ordered or own rolls.  Ugh.  I hate when mess-ups like this happen.We told our waitress about the issue and she left to talk to the owner/mgr.  The owner/mgr. came by quite awhile later to ask us what the issue was.  We explained clearly about the unexpected charge and the miscommunication but he wouldn't budge.  In fact, he brought up how good of a quality the fish were, and given that, this is still a good deal.  The whole time, I kept thinking if I should tell the truth about the quality of his fish, but I kept my mouth shut in case he was going to give us a break.I suppose we all could've said something because at the end, nothing happened out of the negotiation.  He wouldn't even take the charge of one $35 plate of sushi off, so we paid, left, and vowed never to come back.  I've had a lot of sushi before, but I would rank this as the worst sushi AND experience ever.  There are a ton of other great sushi restaurants in Vegas, so look it up on Yelp and go there.  You will not regret it.Since Raku was closed for the first couple days of the New Year, we had to search for another new place to eat.We found Osaka Japanese Bistro.First of all, there's some history to this place.  It's been around for over 40 years so you have to assume they know what they're doing.  It's also in a slightly shady part of town where only locals should go or those who are lost searching for Ichiza find themselves.We started off with some sushi rolls and sashimi.  Meh.  I've had fresher sashimi and better tasting roll combinations.  Although, I did like the fact Osaka offered half orders on most of their rolls.The entree we ordered was a little better.  We ordered the John's Special and had a good time to sharing.  Tempura was battered a little heavier than I'm use to but the chicken and beef teriyaki had a good flavor.The dessert was surprisingly good.  We had the green tea tiramisu (I know it's a traditional Italian dessert but doesn't it just sound Japanese?).  I would have never have guessed that the flavors of mascarpone and green tea would marry so well.  It was pricey but worth the experience.Overall, I'd be willing to go back for late night eats, desserts, and drinks but will have to pass on having dinner here again.My cousin loves this place. We were actually seated at Steak N Shake and we had this epiphany that we should go get sushi instead. So we got up and drove all the way up the I-15 to Osaka.When you enter, you're greeted by a blank wall. What is this - a Japanese Speakeasy? You then turn right and go through another door that takes you to a small sushi bar area. From this initial view, you'd think the place was tiny. If you continue to the back and left, though, you discover that the place can seat quite a lot of people. They have a Teppanyaki area and a surprising number of private booths and traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables. The space is very aesthetically pleasing.Unfortunately, when it came to the food, I was disappointed. I really wasn't that hungry, but I tried everything that my cousin ordered. We stuck to their late night special menu that is available 10pm-2am.* Beef Tataki Salad - It looked amazing, but it lacked flavor. I think I've only ever had Beef Tataki at Ichiza and theirs runs circles around Osaka's.* King Crab Tempura - This was easily the best thing we ordered. Delicious.* Salmon Skin (half) Roll - This also lacked flavor. I'm kind of a purist in that I like to eat sushi exactly how the chef made it. I never use soy sauce or add wasabi. I stuck to my guns on this, despite the roll really needing the extra flavor.* Screaming Orgasm (ahi sashimi on top of some salad) - This also looked amazing. It had better flavor than the Beef Tataki, but I wasn't blown away by it. The dressing was a little too vinegary.On the plus side, the service was excellent. The two ladies that served us were extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. The green tea tasted great and was the perfect thing on my still recovering throat. Whenever I was running low on tea, the lady would come back and top it off promptly.I really hate giving less than three stars, but I must stay true to the rating system. Indeed, I have experienced better. It's too bad because the service and decor of Osaka are top notch.

This used to be my go-to place anytime I was meeting friends for a casual dinner.  The pizza is very good with an excellent selection of toppings.  However, I will never, repeat never, step foot in this establishment again and here is my story ...  BAD SERVICE AND RUDE MANAGEMENT.I was meeting two girlfriends there.  When I got there, the manager advised she would not seat me until my entire party arrived, which was kind of rude, but understandable.  They fill up fast and the seating is very limited.  When we all arrived we were seated.  The first interaction we had with our waitress came was a snide comment from her, "I thought there were going to be four of you," implying we had no right to be seated if our entire party was not there.When the waitress took our drink order my friend ordered a lemonade.  This waitress pipes up "The lemonade is homemade and is very tart.  Do you still want it?"  she says, with a sigh of impatience.  My friend says yes.  The waitress comes back about 3 minutes later explaining that they are out of lemonade, would she like something else.  My friend explained that she could not drink anything with carbonation and did the waitress have another suggestion.  She did not and my friend stuck with water.  After our food arrived, my friend then asks if they have ice tea as an option.  The waitress with the same amount of snideness says "I think so.  We brew it fresh and it sometimes run out.  Also, it is very minty.  Do you still want it?"  My friend says yes.  And now I'm starting to wonder what is with our waitress.  Every time we ask for something she acts like we are inconveniencing her and why didn't she recommend the ice tea when my friend asked her for non-carbonated drink options?Twenty minutes later our appetizers of garlic cheese bread came and it was good.  Another 15 minutes after that our pizza came ... completely wrong.  I had ordered a "16" pizza with all mushrooms, all black olives, half sausage and half pepperoni."  The pizza came out with all the meat on one half, which is not what I ordered.  I indicated to the waitress that this was wrong and she then proceeded to flip back through her order pad and with another heavy sigh started reading my order back.  I stopped her and told her that I knew what I ordered and this wasn't it.  She offered to have the kitchen make another pizza but "it would be awhile as there are other pizzas ahead of this."  I could just feel her begging us to just deal with it and not make her go back for a new pizza.  One of my friends had been visiting a friend in the hospital and was going to return to her as soon as were done with dinner so we didn't want to wait for a new pizza and just tried to pick around the stuff.  As it turns out, only 1/2 the pizza got eaten as it was just too difficult to deal with.  We never saw our waitress again.  Another 20 minutes pass and then the manager sneaks the bill onto our table and walks away.  I stopped her to explain that our pizza was wrong and I felt it would be a nice gesture for them to give us a reduction on our bill.  The manager stopped me abruptly and indicated that she had heard about the mix-up and felt that "her experienced waitress could not have been wrong."  What??!! Excuse me?  I then told her our side of the story, which she was clearly not interested in hearing and then stated that "sometimes we do offer a discount, but would not in this case."  When I explained I was not some street person trying to get a free meal, just a discount to show their concession, she didn't care and walked away.  If I am going out to dinner to pay five times what it would cost me to make the same meal at home, I expect that some of that money is for customer service and the luxury of being waited upon.  I couldn't believe this complete disregard for their customers.  They didn't seem to care if I would ever return.  Well, now they have not only lost an existing customer, but I will do everything in my power to ensure that I have some impact on whether they get any new customers.  I guess the only way to make my voice heard is by writing about it here.  I felt sick to my stomach when I left there, as if I had actually been robbed at gunpoint.  For a place that relies solely on repeat customers and word of mouth, they have a very high and mighty attitude.  Please avoid the Greenbush at all costs.  If you want a unique and casual pizza place with creative pizza and italian food, visit Villa Dolce in Middleton.  You will have an excellent dining experience without the attitude and parking hassles.Just left the GreenBushBar in Madison. Our group of 7POC + 1 waited a half hour for a table, then a group who came in after us got seated first.The manager, when confronted, said she decided we'd be more comfortable near the a/c and that's why she gave our table away. She didn't ask us, she didn't stop and inform us, we only were aware when she was asked about the table that had been given away.I did not see any POC in there during this entire duration. As we were leaving the manager came out and was like "oh we have a lovely table for you" but it was pretty fucking too late for that bullshit so we went to Qdoba instead.So you might not want to patronize this place if you're in town for Wiscon or ever.

Good place in Squirrel Hill for delicious Thai food and a fun atmosphere. The dining room overlooks the road as it is on the second floor of the building. Reservations are accepted but it wasn't busy when we stopped on a Sunday night. Staff was very professional and polite. They had Thai dancers performing in the dining room which created a fun atmosphere but it was still intimate and not distracting to those having a quiet meal. The portions were large and I had plenty f leftovers to take home. The shrimp and tofu red curry was perfectly spices for me at a 4 on a scale of 3-10. Red curry is my favorite and I always order it anytime I eat Thai food. While I thought it was good here, I do prefer it elsewhere where I have had it with more vegetables and pineapple which I find to be a perfect contrast to the spice. I would probably not get this again if I return. I also had the fresh spring rolls as an appetizer which had a nice presentation, but I found to be slightly dry. Overall, I probably will go elsewhere if I find myself craving Thai cuisine, but if I am in the area, I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again.

Review Text :
***Bob Evans is in the style and price range of Denny's and IHOP though Bob Evans serves a better breakfast than those two restaurant chains; some of the food on this visit was not at the optimal temperature though***Bob Evans is a very popular family restaurant in the Midwest (they also have several locations in the South like this one in a rural part of Charlotte).  Bob Evans is like a countrified Denny's or IHOP.  Bob Evans is most popular for breakfast, which is available all day.  Their signature breakfast item is their sausage gravy and biscuits.  Their sausage gravy is creamy and filled with sausage.  It is surprisingly spicy--at least when compared to the many gravy and biscuits places out there serving bland white milk gravy with biscuits. The sausage gravy at this location definitely delivered the flavor of this popular item at Bob Evans; unfortunately, the sausage gravy could have been a little hotter.  The buttermilk biscuits were similar in quality to what you would get at other Bob Evans locations.  Bob Evans' biscuits have a crunchy top, but they tend to be a tad on the dry side; the sausage gravy helps though. I also had their scrambled eggs, which were fine, and their crispy shredded hash browns that were topped with cheese, scallions and bacon.  Their sausage links were good and better than what you get at most chain restaurants or with hotel breakfasts.  While I liked the sausages here, I enjoyed them more when Bob Evans was a smaller chain. The French toast was below average.  It was not as sweet as it should have been and had a dense, undesirable center. Service was extremely friendly and fitting with the service you get at most Bob Evans locations. Prices were very reasonable.  There were several low-cost options and their bigger breakfast combinations were not too expensive and featured generous portions. The dining room here was simple but comfortable.  This Bob Evans also has a counter where you can buy packaged treats/items and Bob Evans syrups, pancake mix and such. This Bob Evans is an okay breakfast spot in the rural area outside of Downtown Charlotte.  If you head to Downtown Charlotte though, I am sure that you will find much better, more creative and more local breakfast spots. This Bob Evans has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.It's been awhile since I was here and had hopes it would get better.  Service was always their week point and I'm sorry to say, it has not gotten any better.Granted it appears they have done some remodeling in the front which does give a nice open clean atmosphere on entering, it stops there.We stopped for lunch today after shopping at Northlake Mall.  The host was not sure of his seating chart and had to physically go and confirm so there was more than a fair measure of confusion here.  He seated us in a booth but apparently no one told our server who did not appear for over 5 minutes going on 10.She was not very friendly but everyone has an off day.  My wife ordered iced tea and I ordered coffee.  Can't comment on her tea and while Bob Evans Coffee is normally very good and they sell it at the counter, my coffee was extreamely weak and had nothing bold about it.My wife ordered a bowl of their potato soup and a large salad while I had the open faced turkey with dressing, mashed potatoes, cranberries and gravy.  I expected a open faced turkey sandwich with dressing, mashed potatoes on the side along with the cranberries.  Everything except the cranberries were piled on top of each other and as far as the cranberries, never did see them anywhere.I had my tablet while I was there so I could check the news but should have gone back to the car to get my hotspot.  While their WiFi which the advertize at the door, showed a strong signal, it kept dropping several times a minute.  Finally gave up and went back to the smartphone.All in all, would not recommend to anyone.  Poor service, indiferrent and uninvolved management and less than stellar cusine does not make for a sucessful restaurant.

The chocolate brownie at Madison Sourdough could end world war.(I'm certain of it.)Forget about awkward insides like nuts or chips that just get in the way and slow you down, and ditch the dusting of powdered sugar or even worse fudge, (stop putting fudge on brownies America) and what you're left with is a brownie in its purest form. Rectangle shaped chocolate. That is all. I'm not certain what chocolate they use, but it's rich and it's creamy, and the texture of the brownie itself has a certain moistness that's beyond description. And I don't even like the word moist! But it's the only word in my lexicon to describe just how sink-your-teeth-in-drool-worthy these things are. And on one hand it's hard for me to overlook the delicious pasty that blankets the two glass cases at Madison Sourdough, but on the other hand the brownie stands out as the best option to cure my craving each and every time. It's like a cacao beacon begging me to eat it. I've also had breakfast and lunch, sipped some strong brew and on a rare occasion got a cookie (a cookie!) and while tasty nothing tops what is possibly the best brownie I've ever eaten. (And I'm a brownie connoisseur. I grew up in a home where brownies were as popular as Real Housewives spin offs. 5 or so home-baked varieties stocked our freezer and wound up in school lunches. So I know.) In conclusion.... get a brownie. It's the secret to world peace.My husband and I were in the area looking for a fantastic food choice, Yelp and my husband's hankering for a latte beckoned us here.  We chose to eat off the lunch side (breakfast until 3 PM too) with orders of the Pork and Apple sandwich and Chicken Pannini.  Both came with a side salad tossed with a light vinaigrette.   The sandwiches were tasty and the bread was fantastic.  The pork was on baguette and the chicken was a hearty sourdough.  My husband isn't into tough breads so it was tender and still crunchy.  I have to admit, I thought the pork was going to be acceptable but it had beautiful flavors which gave a sweet savory.  I will be back but to try the bakers breakfast or french toast.The City of Madison continues to impress me with its food offerings; most recently, Madison Sourdough was added to my ever-expanding list of places to go while in this terrific town.Whether you're looking for a pastry, full-on breakfast, lunch, just a cup of coffee, or a crusty sourdough baguette to bring home, MS on Willy Street has you covered, and everything hits the sweet spot in your stomach.We visited recently and had a delicious breakfast, and what a bonus that it happened to be a beautiful morning to sit outside on their patio. It felt like we were in Europe, mostly because of the adorable pooches lying obediently under the tables while their owners were enjoying their breakfast.Started out with perfect cafe mochas. I am very picky about this drink--it has to have just the right ratio of espresso/chocolate/milk, and it's very easy for one to overpower the other, but theirs was spot-on.The breakfast sandwich I had was a thing of beauty, and filled me up right up until dinner. Eggs (anyway you like 'em, I chose fried), cheddar cheese, and aioli, all served on a toasted croissant. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to add their house-smoked ham. It was so satisfying, and every component was delicious. Served with some lovely mixed greens on the side.Other breakfast items range from the traditional (eggs benedict, omelets, biscuits and gravy ) to the less conventional (huevos rancheros, sourdough french toast, potato hash with duck fat and farro), as well as a daily quiche and strata offering. You can't go wrong, and whether you're trying to be healthy or gluttonous, it's all outstanding.Lunch is similarly diverse: opt for a cubano, veggie pesto sandwich, grilled cheese, chicken salad or braised beef cheeks.On Wednesday mornings they do something called "Coffee with Cops," which is a great way to engage the community and give and receive information in an informal setting.Service is uber friendly. It goes without saying that their bread is fantastic, and it's served at many restaurants in Madison.I just love this place and plan to visit as much as I can when in Madison.I spent a couple of hours at Madison Sourdough and it was enjoyable from top to bottom. Corey D and I started with breakfast. I had a decaf latte and I know, I know. What's the point of coffee without caffeine? Being pregnant means I can't have too much caffeine, but I still really enjoy the smell and taste of coffee, hence the decaf version. And sometimes decaf tastes terrible, like the coffee gods are punishing you for having poor taste. But, this one was quite nice.For food I ordered a selection of sides - a build-your-own-breakfast if you will. I had two eggs, a giant side of fruit, and a warm biscuit served with house made preserves. I enjoyed every bite.After breakfast we spent some time working, aka Internetting, and the connection was always reliable and the atmosphere calm and friendly. I would easily recommend this spot for breakfast, a bit of work, meeting up with friends, or baked goods!

Review Text :
Congratulations, State Street Brats: you nailed it! And by "it" I mean being just awful. Last night some friends and I went to Brats after not being able to acquire hockey tickets. We wanted a semi-ridiculous, sports-centric atmosphere, so Brats seemed like the logical choice. We'd all been in college, and thought we knew what to expect. Nope.After grabbing a booth upstairs and sitting around for awhile, a waitress came by and asked if we were interested in ordering. After telling her yes, she told us that they were cutting their wait staff so we had to go to the bar to order. Not a huge deal, but there were some flaws:1) the wait staff that was supposedly cut were aimlessly wandering around the bar for the entire time we were there2) when you ordered, they told you to just come back and check if your food was ready - no estimate of time, no notification system, and again, no use of their employees milling about3) after our table had ordered and checked for food a few times, the table behind us got waiter serviceThanks for your outstanding customer service, guys!To top it off, the food was as lacking as the service. The nachos were basically a pile of oil, the cheese curds eerily resembled bad breaded chicken used at fast food Chinese restaurants, and the burger baskets were a ripoff. While the burger was okay, the $2 upcharge for fries was a joke. For $2.50 you can get an entire basket of fries, but the two bucks they charge to add them to your burger only gets you about fifteen soggy fries. While the portion size was okay (I ate about two before deciding they were too gross to continue on with), it's nonsense that they charge you so much for a tenth of what comes in a basket that you could just order separately for virtually the same price. At the very least, I learned a very important lesson: State Street Brats is best enjoyed by highly intoxicated college students and my time there is over.

Review Text :
Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a food snob, but I do enjoy cooking and when I eat out, I like to order food that offers me something that I can not easily create myself.  We are new to Madison, and just the week before we ate at Tutto's down the street from Portabella's for the first time.  Tuttos is almost exactly the same price-point and we had good food, a great atmosphere, and a wonderful time.When I took my wife's family to Portabella's for her birthday, I was expecting something special.  The restaurant had equally good reviews for food and absolutely rave reviews for atmosphere.  When we arrived, we were promptly ushered into that room that is typically set aside for families with children (or the under-dressed).  No problems there, a little tacky, but the service was still attentive and we didn't want to ruin anyone else's romance.In short, we were still prepared to be impressed.  We were very surprised to discover that the food was absolutely lousy.  Not just bad, cheap catered wedding banquet bad. To give you an idea of what I mean, the chicken breast in the chicken rollatini was not properly dressed and still had bits of gristle attached.  It also had that peculiarly soft texture that comes from sitting in a steamy warmer for hours before being used.  The "procuitto" in the rollatini was actually sliced smoked ham.  The walnut pesto was so oily that it began to separate on the plate and the red potatoes were a soggy pile of pepper, potato,and oil.  The entire plate was an overcooked, tasteless, and oily mess.If the rollatini was an embarassment, the lasagna was simply careless.  It's composition was sloppy.  The noodles (all two of them) were so liquid heavy that they did not hold their texture.  The sauce was thin and ran out of the lasagne onto the plate, which made the entire dish something like a chunky soup.  The entire thing was a sloppy mess.  A personal annoyance (that doesn't necessarily indicate poor craftsmanship) was that there were chunks of meat the size of my thumbs.Our other food was similarly flawed, but it was the sangria that ruined the evening.  My wife loves sangria.  She loves it enough that she isn't particularly picky about it.  I can totally understand using cheap wine and triple sec (instead of a premium orange liqueur) for the drink.  I can even understand adding a little juice to thin it out if it's too strong.  What I cannot understand is adding water to dilute it.  Typically, if my sangria tastes a watery I assume that it's ice-melt, but this was a degree of watery that I have only tasted before when I went back to a glass sitting in the hot sun that wasn't worth drinking anymore. Our sangria was literally 1/3 water.This is one restaurant that has either confused its catering business with it's sit down service, has gotten sloppy, or thinks that its ambiance is sterling enough to make up for lousy food.  Whatever is the case, I can't imagine ever ordering food there again.I need to preface this by saying that the company was AWESOME!I love ya Kristen if you're reading this, I do. And it was a blast getting to celebrate your birthday with you. But other than that... This place is rrrrrrrrrrrough. 1. A young server who couldn't make strong menu recommendations.2. A negroni that looked like a shirley temple and tasted like nothing I wanted to drink.3. The most flavorless... FLA-VUH-LESS chicken Parmesan I think I've ever eaten. 4. This weird noodle, the name of which I can't remember, that they're supposed to be known for but I can't forget soon enough. Over cooked, mealy, melt in your mouth like you don't want your pasta to do. 5. And honestly, overpriced for the quality and portion size. This place reminds me of Caruso's in Tucson (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carusos-tucson#hrid:6nm_dN4voJ43v98n5IF3PQ). Also Italian. Also an institution. And maybe good back in the day? Sometimes when things get older they age gracefully. And other times they suck harder than a six year-old on a jolly rancher. I know these one star reviews are hard for folks to digest, but so is Porta Bella. When I think about my scale for going as low as I've done so here I think, "is there any redeeming quality that would make it so I would return?" Methinks not.

Review Text :
December?December!That's the last time I took it to the keys to pound out some prose for these guys? Don't ask me why it's taken so long to update my lower level review about the basement which I sort of abstain from now. Don't ask me why it's taken so long to give high praise for the upstairs. And don't ask me how many weekends are spent in low lighting eating one of my favorite steaks on the capital. Their late night (after 10pm) menu is beyond compare. It only has a handful of options but each is incredible. The steak has been and will forever be my jam. At $13 it's a steal, and throw an onion ring the size of my head on top and it's even better! They also have a pretty extensive cocktail situation and I know they'll make you anything you want off the menu. It seems like they might be switching out some wines, because there were some new pages this week when I eyed them over. Staff behind the bar during the week and on weekends is top notch; attentive, conversational, prompt! It's a little tricky to sit in the small booths with more than one other person, but honestly part of the fun is figuring out how you're going to cram two steaks, a basket of fries, cheese curds and two cocktails on a surface the size of a Nilla wafer.I love everything about the Tornado Room. Everything about this place is a throwback to a bygone era, from the wood-paneled walls, low ceilings, and and dim lighting, to the simple menu, complementary garnishes, and delicious cocktails. Even their late-night steak sandwiches are fantastic. If you're looking to get your socks knocked off with a gastronomic experience, go elsewhere. The Tornado is about standard steaks, chops, and fish prepared the old fashioned way, with standard sides like baked potatoes, hashbrowns, and thick-cut vegetables. It's rare at a steakhouse for the sides to be included in the protein prices, but they are at Tornado, which I believe makes this place an extra good value. Order an old fashioned or some recommended wine to wash your meal down, and enjoy every second of the classic fine dining experience. This is not the kind of place you'll have the pleasure of walking into every day.I love this place so much. I remember when I first moved here I would walk by it all the time and pay it no mind. From the outside it always seemed a bit like a dive. How wrong I was! For my second visit it was also during the hours where they have their late night menu. You can get an 8 oz sirloin for 13 bucks which is what I had my heart set on. It got me through the work week knowing that on Friday night I would be having an amazing steak. It's a great deal considering during normal hours their steaks will average 20 to 40 dollars. Fried cheese curds were shared among the table. A friend thought they might actually be better than the old fashioned's cheese curds! The French onion soup I had for an appetizer. It was good but not something I would order again. Both times I've eaten downstairs and the ambiance is wonderful. Cozy, intimate, fun tunes, and great friendly waiting staff.

Review Text :
...and the challenger "Dance Stuffed in My Pocket" recieves...3 and 1/4 StarsPink Lotus is a decent, clean, hole-in-the-strip-mall americhino classic.Their extensive menus includes all the basics, prepared hot and fresh for you to takeout or dine in, as long as the odd mural on the wall doesn't scare you off.  (pic)The food was pretty good.  General Tsao's chicken is a barometer to me, and Pink Lotus' rendition was a little different.  Think more along the lines of spicy terriyaki than hoysin.  But there were lots of bits of green onion and minced FRESH garlic (I'm still getting garlic burps).  The consistency, as well as the flavor that was underneath the sauce, was more like rough chopped chunks of crispy fried chicken than the usual batter-balls.  Good but a little greasy.Pink Lotus is pretty generous with giving small discounts to deserving community members like military or helathcare workers (pic).They've been hidden on the outside edge of this shopping center for years and I'd never noticed them before.With lunch specials at around $5-6 including drink, more menu research must be done here, clearly.

Diners, Drive in and Dives! A must try place! So we trekked out after work yesterday. I love the location, Love the style, people and atmosphere. The place was packed! Everyone seemed to be having a great time and the vibe was hip and cool!Service was a little slow! Chips were average and not fresh, Salsa was nothing much to speak of a bit of a disappointment.I had three taco's Mahi, Shrimp Tara something..... all were good Tara was #1 Shrimp was #2 and Mahi was #3. Mashed Potatoes were forgettableI've heard a lot about Cabo Fish Taco, from friends in Charlotte and from Food Network.  I decided it was time I found out what all the fuss is over.  I'm now left wondering just what, exactly, all the fuss IS over.  Cabo has generated a lot of hype, but does not have the substance to back it up.Given that it was a Saturday night, I assumed there would be a bit of a wait.  We were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes, and the hostess was pretty accurate.  After initially getting our names on the wait list, though, she could have done without immediately telling us we were in her way (in those words, exactly).  We made it to our table, and the waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink orders.  We inquired about the specials on the chalk board, only to find out those were from yesterday and no one got around to updating the sign.  We placed our orders from the regular menu.  And waited.   And waited. And watched other tables, who were seated AFTER us, receive their orders BEFORE us.  Mind you, half the restaurant is still empty.  After 45 minutes of waiting and inattentive service from our waitress, she explained there was a mix up in the kitchen.  She was unable (unwilling?) to compensate us in any way for such poor service.The food finally arrived and I was unimpressed.  It tasted good, but not Food Network, everyone's-talking-about-it good.  The tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland.When you add it all up, and factor in the fact that the place is so loud it's impossible to do more than look at the other people at your table, I felt like I had wasted my money and the better part of my evening on a miserable experience.  Needless to say, I won't be giving Cabo a second chance.

Review Text :
Sat at table for 10 minutes no service and no one ever stopped to say we'll be right with you... even though there was waite staff present.  We were about to leave when the waiter came. I said, "wow we were about to leave."  The waiter responds, "Okay you can leave if you want".  OH YES WE LEFT!You want my $50 for steak and lobster and you behave like this and give this kind of service?  I don't think I'll be paying for you to treat me like this. OH YES WE LEFT!When I think of Billy Bob's Steak House, that 1965 oldie "5 O' Clock World"  by the Vogues plays in my head. That is because it's a 5 O' clock world when Billy Bob's opens for business in style with an hour long $12.99 prime rib special that ends at 6 o' clock.   Billy Bob's $12.99 prime rib special is a nice deal that includes a large serving of prime rib with a choice of potato and salad. With a beverage, tax, and tip; the $12.99 prime rib special adds up to $20. Still a good deal.   On a recent visit to Sam's Town, I saw the advertisement for the $12.99 prime rib special. I had to go back to try it. After hiking in Wetlands Park, I treated myself to a post hike dinner at Billy Bob's. Service:     Throughout the dining experience the waiter was friendly and on top of the Coke refills. Fine service from seating myself to paying the check. Ambience:    Billy Bob's is a fun restaurant to dine in. My patio seat was in Mystic Falls Park, Sam's Town's Disneyesque park under an atrium reflecting real sunlight where audio autotronic animals entertain the guests. My table would be a nice spot to take in the laser show. And it isn't everyday, where you are enjoying prime rib to look up and see a realistic bear growling as he looks your way at the same time that birds chirp away, and a waterfall cascades into a Disneyesque park. My table was also along the walking path through the perimeter of Mystic Falls Park. Billy Bob's is also a casual restaurant to dine in. The dining room beyond the bar is dimly lit creating a different environment from Mystic Falls Park. Prime rib dinner:    I was satisfied with the prime rib dinner. After hours of hiking, the $12.99 prime rib tasted like a million bucks. The portions were both quality and quantity. This also included the salad. Now the baked potato with both sour cream and butter could of been a meal in itself. Finally the prime rib, as the picture proceeding the review shows, was large, thick, and juicy. Regardless of a few Swiss cheese shaped spots of fat, I'd give the prime rib four stars. Return factor:   Billy Bob's won me over with two things that I enjoy when dining out: delicious food at a fair price and an upbeat dining environment. Mix the upbeat Disneyland environment of Mystic Falls Park with a tasty prime rib special, oh he'll yeah I'm a fan. I cannot guarantee it, but sometime in the future I am leaning toward returning for the steak and shrimp special. Now if I could only get that song "5 O' Clock World" out of my head.

Nice folks with good service but the food is nothing great and the setting is a bit dated.You can tell this is a NASCAR themed restaurant with all of the race car hoods and sides mounted to the ceiling and walls and after all, it;s about one mile from Charlotte Motor Speedway.  Pictures of Dale Earnhardt Sr adorn the walls and tables as well.  Problem is the carpet needs to be replaced or at least cleaned, the vinyl seats in the booth we sat at was badly cracked as were all of them. In general in needs a good facelift.The staff is outstanding and we never wanted for anything.  Walking in with the signs on the outside I thought I was entering a typical greek diner and at one time, may have been the case but very Americanized now.I ordered a Steak Sandwich which had very little taste or texture to it. My potato salad side on the other hand was pretty good.  My wife had a Philly Cheese Steak which she described as good but not to the point she would order it again.Maybe it was an off day but nothing great to recommend from our visit today.

Review Text :
I felt compelled to write a review of Thomas Street given the unfortunate press that has surrounded it lately.  I've been going to Thomas Street for about 2 years now and it has one of the most ecclectic and diverse crowds I've seen in Charlotte.  During the week, you will find a less crowded more chill scene, and on the weekend it is usually packed after 10:30 (but not in a way that makes it annoying).  The outside patio has cornhole, and ping pong tables -  inside there is pool and foozball.  The bartenders are very down to earth.  The drink prices are the best I've seen in Charlotte, and they are poured generously.  This is NOT a club scene, top 40 kind of place.  You will find a juke box with mostly alternative and classics.  Come dressed down, and be prepared to get comfortable and have a great time.  Oh, and if you are leaving the bar solo at night, a bartender or bouncer is always happy to walk you to your car (in fact, they insist!).There really isn't a bad thing I could say about Thomas Street.  It gets 5 stars because they also allow dogs on the patio :)*Please note, I reviewed Thomas Street Tavern as a bar, not a restaurant.

I'm sorry but I cannot NOT give this place five stars. I know it's hood. I know it's cash only. I know it's host to many shady shady characters. I know this because I can't stop going back. It's all in the Jimmy Jack's experience! I'll tell you this. I've never been accosted by anyone here. The food has always been hot and the prices are a value. The ladies who work the window have always been friendly and prompt. And I've always been able to find parking and a place to sit here. What's there not to like?

There needs to be more BYOB's in Pittsburgh, just saying! There is something about going out for a long dinner with friends and finishing (3 big) bottles of wine that warms my antioxidant rich heart! I have tried to go here a couple times before but couldn't get a reservation.  There are soo many quaint restaurants like this in Philly and I miss them in the burgh (there is even an interactive BYOB map with the closest liquor stores listed). I went with a man-friend, and the waiter (Matt) was really patient with us because we were taking forever to order.  The menu was interesting but not too over the top so simple palettes aren't overwhelmed. Friendly, Cute, French, Cozy. Perfect. We started which the spinach dip. Delish. I ordered the scallops which was a smaller portion but hit the spot! My friend ordered the salmon which was also delicious. I had a bite of that and I might get that next time! I am going to be honest, We might have drank a huge bottle of wine during the meal and stayed to close.  We left smiling (with purple stained teeth) and full. Pro: Cozy, Outdoor seating (although it was closed), BYOB! BYOB! Delicious food, friendly service, good noise level, BYOB, open kitchenCon: Can be tough to get a res (but thats because its awesome), limited indoor seating, stem charge, cash onlyOverall: Check it out! Great date spot!Sadly, when I think Southside, I'm like the masses who think of a bunch of drunk college kids puking their guts out at 2AM.  What I don't think about is a small little restaurant with upscale food and a laid-back vibe.  This place totally flies under the radar, and it definitely this aspect that makes me like this place so much.  Everything you'll enjoy about this place is completely unexpected (or maybe less so now that I'm telling you!).  When you walk in, you'll notice a small cafe vibe with this surprisingly European like feel: 10 or so small tables are located in the back.  The decoration is somewhat nondescript (we sat next to a refrigerator proudly displaying the "Coke" logo).  What is cool is the fact that the food is literally prepared next to you behind this counter.   The service is among the best I have experienced in this city.  The hallmark of a good waiter is one who anticipates your needs.  For instance, on Valentine's day when I went, I ordered a small cup of soup, and the server was insightful enough to bring out two spoons.  I know, a little detail, but one that matters and makes my experience that much better.Speaking of the food: out of this world.  The menu options are somewhat limited, but I can tell they must change, as do their specials.  There will be a vegetarian option waiting for you.  We started our meal out with bruschetta that came with creamy cheese-spinach sauce with plenty of cubed-seasoned tomatoes: so rich, so creamy, so so good.  The bruchetta was also crisp and warm-simply perfect.  The mushroom soup we shared was full of 4 different types of musrhooms: oyster, shitake, portobello and porcini.  My entree was the eggplant dish: baked eggplant with this sweet pepper sauce, some cheese and...really, I don't know what else but other than the fact it left this little ting in my mouth which when combined with the sweetness of the sauce made for an incredible experience.  My girlfriend enjoyed her salmon dish.  We capped off the meal with chocolate mousse which was simply decadent.  Several other things to note prior to dining here.  1.) Make reservations and make them in advance.  2.) Don't come here expecting full privacy.  Tables are jam packed next to each other.  We definitely had a neighboring couple interrupt us in our conversation since they over-heard something we were talking about that must have appealed them.  Luckily for us, this interaction proved to be quite pleasant and added to our experience, but just a heads up for the rest of you..3.) Cash only, so go to the ATM.  3 course meal for 2 will run you around $80, which certainly isn't bad given the high quality of the food and 4.) BYOB so definitely bring something to complement the fantastic flavor of the food that you are about to enjoy!I cannot wait until the weather warms up again so that I can sit in their outdoor patio. I love that they are BYOB. The spinach and pecorino dip with french baguette is to die for. Make sure to order the large as you will definitely want more! I had the scallops with mango habanero sauce and wild rice along with charred tomatoes. I could have eaten another plate of this -so good! I'm sure that I will be back before the weather warms up for the patio, it is just that good!

Review Text :
So I gave Portland's another shot this past weekend, given their $30 summer prix fixe menu and its proximity to my new place.  Like Melissa H said there was a change in the pf menu and the fish I was going to get was replaced with duck, to which I am allergic.  So the pf menu was out.I agree with everything she said about the appetizers.  I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta for my entree and I was less than impressed.  The pasta was incredibly overcooked, it was literally falling apart on my fork.  The shrimp were large and plentiful so I just ended up eating all the shrimp and leaving the shreds of pasta behind.  The strangest part of the meal, for me, was when my entree was brought to the table.  I was informed that they did not have any knives. (!) but "I did bring you a fork"....wow, that is so nice of you!  I was just planning on using my hands to eat the pasta but you thought so much to bring me a fork!  I looked around at all the empty tables around us that had place settings and wondered why they could not have given me one of those place settings which had knives.  (Seriously, by that point we were one of two parties in the restaurant).  I was then left with a choice of a. shoving a whole shrimp into my mouth, b. eating the shrimp off the fork in a klassy corn dog type of fashion or c. cutting the shrimp with my fork.  (I opted for c. and it was pretty difficult to do...)  My conclusion on Portland's is that the food is consistently mediocre (sometimes even below mediocre) and it functions best as a place to have a drink.I enjoyed my first two visits to Portland's. During my last visit we sat up at the bar and ordered some food as well as drinks. *shocker*  My friend and I split a medium rare filet with accompanying sides. (something that resembled scalloped potato's and something else I don't recall... don't judge, I had a glass of wine under my belt)Anyway, the steak was cooked as requested and everything was pretty tasty. I wasn't insanely impressed (hence the 3 stars) and while it was all decent, nothing stood out. The space is cute and modern yet has an odd layout. I don't see the restaurant side getting too much action but I could be wrong. One thing I will never understand....and this goes for many places, I'm not just picking on Portland's.What is the deal with the surly ass bartenders in the mid-down town area of Phoenix. I know that because you bartend down town you think you're hip and rad and all that nonsense....(are those glasses even prescription??)  but you wouldn't last a fucking minute serving in countless other cities with that attitude. Just sayin..... go to NYC "rockstar" and see how fast you're chewed up and spit out. Maybe you're a true asshole.... maybe you just need a little more fiber in your diet, i dunno...but whatever it is, figure it out somewhere else. Thanks.It was a Thursday night when my friend and I decided to stop at Portland's for a bite and a glass of wine. We walked in to an empty restaurant, which made me nervous. We were greeted and told we could sit wherever we would like. We chose to sit in a window seat. A friendly waitress came over and asked us if we'd like something to drink. We decided on a few glasses of wine after some suggestions from her. My dinner partner went to the restroom to wash his hands and when he came back he said "This place hasn't been top to bottom cleaned in a LONG time. Probably since they opened!" He said that there was built up dust on the air vents. Don't ask me why he was staring at the ceiling, he just happened to. The news made me wonder about the top to bottom cleanliness of their kitchen.. hmm... We chose to proceed with ordering food. We chose the Tommy burger and the Alfredo burger. The Tommy burger had Applewood-smoked bacon, Stilton blue cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo. The Alfredo burger had roasted poblano peppers, jalapeno mayo, lettuce and tomato. You have to order the fries ala carte. They don't come with the burger, which was kind of silly. We went with an order of Parmesan fries and an order of Cajun fries. While waiting for our food, I asked the waitress why the place was so empty. She said "It's Downtown Phoenix at night!" Um...has she spent any time in Downtown Phoenix lately? I told her that we had just come from another, larger establishment that had just opened and the place was packed. She said "I'd like to see them when all of the buzz has died down." She may be right, but it makes no sense that a restaurant that is connected to a LARGE apartment complex, next to a hotel, right on the light rail is almost empty on a Thursday night. Our food arrived and I was surprised by the burgers. They were served on plain ol' Wonderbread hamburger buns. Yeah, those. I took a bite into my burger and it was good! Not stellar, not amazing, just good! I didn't mind the plain ol' bun after a while. Honestly, sometimes the bun overpowers the burger. The fries were ok. Again I wasn't blown away. They were just fine. The bill came and that's when I minded the plain ol' bun. I remembered that the Tommy burger was $11 and the Alfredo burger was $9. The cups of fries were $4 each. Well that puts a different spin on things. For the quality of food we had, we were definitely short-changed. What do you expect out of an $11 burger? Think about it. Portland's has SO MUCH potential, but they give off a bar-fly attracting vibe instead of a Downtown Clientele vibe. Would I go back? Yeah, maybe during a burger special night, but I don't know if I would seek out Portland's for a nice dinner again. We'll see.

This is a Breakfast ,Lunch place that used to be beyond Great!We really loved coming here many years ago.The same people worked here and it was always a pleasure to come in.Food was wonderful and so was the service.Then things started to change. The food was not as good,They changed the menu up.  Then the staff started to change.When you start losing all the staff you have had for so many years something is not right inside the company.The service and food really went downhill.So we stopped coming here.Well, lately I have been back 2x's. Things are better. They are trying.But, it is still not the same. However, service is fast again, and they do check on you all the time. Food is working it self back up the hill.Maybe they should fo more organic or something.It is still a good place, just not what it was.This is in my neighborhood but didn't even know it existed, probably because it was mostly hidden from view by I-17 and its fences. So it was good that Rand H. invited me to join him and Mike C. here for weekday brunch.  This place has friendly service, a sunny interior with a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable, if slightly cramped, booths and tables. I ordered "The Works" which is an omelet with ham, bacon, sausage, crimini mushrooms, onions and tomatoes with cheddar and monterey jack. topped with sour cream, and chose a mixed green salad as a side. The omelet was good and was a moderate-size portion; it would still qualify as a light lunch. The mixed green salad was nothing special. The coffee was delicious and was refilled in a timely manner. I would not hesitate to bring friends to for a nice leisurely breakfast or lunch.

China Pantry is located in the food court of the Las Vegas Premium outlets. Right in the middle of a busy shopping spree with my cousins, I found myself ordering a three item combo to share from here. For a little under $8, I got a combo with fried rice, noodles, chicken teriyaki, chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms. Pros: It was a decent amount of food! They don't really give a lot but it is enough to get you decently full. The chicken teriyaki was nice and lean! There was a good amount of chicken in the chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms (meaning it wasn't all veggies).Taste wise the food was pretty good. The chicken dishes were flavorful! The curry sauce was good. The teriyaki was just the right amount of sweet! Cons: I didn't order anything to drink but did ask for water. The lady working there gave me a cup of water and when I asked for another (since I was sharing this meal), she said only one water per customer :(.It's an OK place. A little bit pricey which is to be expected since it is at a food court at a popular outlet.

I'm probably going to get raked across the coals since this is def. a locals favorite.Thanksgiving at Steiner's:  1.  First of all, it was freezing.  In the restaurant.  Warmer outside.  I kept my coat on as we were seated.2.  We were seated at a tabled, ordered, received our drinks, told we had to move to another table since our current table was reserved for people who NEVER SHOWED UP.  The manager actually told the waitress to have us move IN FRONT OF US, having the waitress be the bad guy rather than dirty her own hands.3.  I asked if I could order the pumpkin pie separately out of the Thanksgiving deal.  I was told no.  Even asked if I could pay EXTRA.  Nope, no bueno.   I went next door and gave my money to the grocery store and ate an entire one following said meal.4.  My sandwich was cold.  HOWEVER!  The fries were delicious, and seasoned very well.So  I dropped by months later overnight, you know, non-Thanksgiving to try them out on a regular late night.The bartender was cranky, when we asked if could change out potatoes for french fries, a short, "We don't do that here" was thrown back at us.  Unfriendly, uninspiring, average prices.  Good fries, though.

Review Text :
My new favorite brunch spot in the 'burgh!  It's all vegetarian, and sooo good.  Definitely worth waiting in the line that forms before this place opens up on Sunday.You pick an entree, usually there are french toast and scramble options--last time I went, there was even a BBQ seitan sandwich.  I went with lemon artichoke stew, which was heavenly.  There are also different herbal teas, juices, and coffee to choose as a beverage.The best part is the buffet line--close to 30 different salads (veggie, pasta, and fruit) to choose from and a whole table full of pies and cakes. The dishes are fiestaware and different antique pitchers and glasses from the Zenith's antique store.  The atmosphere is cute and kitschy, and you can buy any of the art on the walls.I will definitely be back for brunch on future Sundays, I might even try lunch or dinner here as well.  The Zenith is a great little place!I visited the Zenith yesterday for Sunday brunch with fellow Yelper Chelsea S.  We'd been wanting to do brunch together for awhile, so I suggested the Zenith, since I knew it was near where she lives and I'd heard it was a really unique and cool brunch venue.  Although neither of us are vegetarian or had tried a vegetarian brunch before, we're both game to try new things, so we decided to check it out.The first thing you notice when walking into the Zenith is the interesting kitschy antiques everywhere--including suspended from the ceiling.  Unlike the Beehive coffeeshop further down Carson St., which has similar interesting decor, it's my understanding that these items--as well as the tables, chairs, flatware, etc.--can be purchased.  I'm not sure of the range of prices, since I didn't inquire, though.The second thing that became apparent, which I didn't realize from reading previous reviews, is that parties of two are mostly seated together with other pairs (i.e., communal/family style seating).  That wasn't a problem for us, since our tablemates were interesting conversation partners, but if you're a couple looking for an intimate/romantic brunch venue, you may wish to look elsewhere.  If, on the other hand, you're game for meeting new people, by all means, check it out!As for ordering, the setup is a hybrid of a prix fixe and a brunch buffet.  All of the entrees, which change on a weekly basis, are the same price ($11.50), which also includes coffee or tea with unlimited refills.  (I had herbal tea.)  Once you order, you have access to the buffet tables, one of which focuses on salads and fruit/vegetable side dishes, and the other of which contains an assortment of bundt cakes.For my entree, I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I was expecting wafer-thin flapjacks, but they turned out to be quite thick, moist, and cakey--in a good way. This entree was proof that vegetarian fare can be quite filling!  I wasn't as much of a fan of the side dish that came with it (not sure what exactly it was), but it added some welcome savoriness.  As it were, my selections from the vegetable buffet table added the savoriness I needed to offset the sweetness of the pancakes.  They included pasta salad, thai peanut noodles (?), chickpea salad, spinach salad, a piece of bread, and some fruit, as well.  All of them were quite good, and also filling in their own right.  Finally, I sampled several of the bundt cakes (double chocolate, vanilla blueberry, poppy seed lemon, and orange lavender (?)).  While I enjoyed all of them, too, my favorite was the double chocolate, due to its moistness. If you don't have as much of a sweet tooth as me, you may prefer some of the other flavors, which were less sweet.I'm definitely glad that I tried the Zenith's brunch buffet, since it's one of the most unique brunches in PGH, for sure.  Even if you're leery of vegetarian food, I'd encourage you to check it out--I daresay you'll be pleasantly surprised!  And, of course, it was great to share the experience with a fellow Yelper (Chelsea S.), as well as our table mates, and make some new friends while enjoying a delicious brunch!

I'm so glad this place decided to treat my friends and I like scum, I love that! -Waiting 20 minutes for simple food? Check!-20 minute wait for any type of communication from the waitress? Check!-Attitude from said waitress? Check!-Giving us the bullshit fake line about the Credit Card minimum?

I blame myself. My expectations were high. Not sure why, but they were.I found no fault, per se, in any of the dishes we ordered, yet I wasn't blown away. I didn't have that eager-for-the-next-bite kinda feeling that I always hope for; everything just seemed average.As usual, our party ordered an appetizer of calamari to enjoy alongside the complimentary bread and olive oil. No complaints. Though I didn't dig into either too much.As far as entrees, we ordered:*Butter pasta and parmesan*Wood-grilled paprika sausage and octopus w. red potatoes, chickpeas, swiss chard, san marzano tomato, and saffron aioli*Chicken milanese of parmesan and breadcrumb chicken w. salsa verde and fried egg, served on polenta*Orechiette with fraboni's sausage and rapini w. roasted garlic-steeped cream and a splash of brandy*8oz cider brined pork loin chop w. yukon golds, seared escarole, grilled lemon & tuscan olive oil Of everything that we ordered, what most stands out for me as enjoyable was the pork loin chop. I was able to try a few bites and quite enjoyed the dish. So I wouldn't rule this place out right away. I plan on giving it another try, as some other dish may pleasantly surprise me.

I heard about this place through a bank teller that hada sign in front of his window that portrayed his favorite food.. "..burgers.." So I asked, "What's the Best Burger you've had here in Vegas?" He replies "At the Seven Seas, it's in the ghetto.. The Louis Burger, tell me what you think.."Place wasn't as bad as I thought.. I walked in the food side entrance (the other went straight to the bar/lounge), looked up at the menu and saw the Burger.. surrounded by a whole lotta southern lovin' comfort food items! MMMMMmmmMMMMM! But that time I was there for one thing only.Louis Burger: plump buns, thick stubby patty, red onion, tomato, lettuce.... came with a mound of fries.. The burger had a nice char, quite juicy, tender, that familiar home grilled flavor but a little too salty for my taste.. Reminded me of a Smash Burger and a Gorden Biersch Burger at same time.. The fries were decent but a little over greased in my opinion. Extra Friendly and Corteous Staff, Prices were fair (cash only), location wasn't that bad, dining area cozy.. The Bar/Lounge was playing some smooth Jazz/R&B Jams.. Nice! Looked like a popular African American hang out. Burger and fries were decent overall. I may comeback to have their catfish or chicken?!..I forgot about this hole in the wall!  If your afraid to go into the not so glamorous, upscale, part of Las Vegas, and you just want some real food!  I would say go here.  They open about 12:00.  If your not use to this area, I would suggest to go maybe before 5 p.m.  We went on a Thursday night.  It was an older crowd in the bar area, it was a "step'n night"  so the crowd is different on this night, than on a Friday - Saturday night. Now don't go in here thinking your going to get what you ordered in 4 - 5 min.  Nope!  That isn't going to happen.  They cook to order!  And it is worth the wait.  The chicken is so crunchy and seasoned!  I can say it's better than mine!  I love crunchy chicken.  The Catfish is the bomb.com!  Yep, I think it's the best place to get fried catfish in this town. And if you know, like I know, it's hard to find.   The greens were good, and the fries are good.  They have yams (I don't care for yams) I'm not sure what else.  So, go place your order, and go sit at the bar, and have a drink or 2.  It will take about 30 min. for them to fry up that yummie chicken!

Review Text :
I hate to do this, but based on my experience last night, I feel that I need to write an update and decrease my rating.  First, the positives: The baristas last night (both female) were very helpful and upbeat, unlike the baristas I'm used to dealing with here.  One of them made me an awesome smoothie consisting of blueberries, pineapple, cherry, and pear (see photo), and it was amazing.  My only complaint is that I noticed there was some left over from the blending, and it would have been nice to have offered it to me (though I didn't notice until too late).  I also ordered a mocha cappuccino that was pretty good, and well-caffeinated, as my friends can attest by my high-energy talkativeness after drinking it.Despite these positives, we encountered several issues.  First, one of my friends ordered a red velvet biscotti, and tasted a moldy flavor when he bit into it (I confirmed the odd taste).  He informed them of the problem, and they did credit him for it, but I'm not sure if they discarded the rest of that type of biscotti.  Second, when I went to use the bathroom to wash up, the toilet seat was sporting some pretty gross stains (please pardon the graphic image).  Third, when we returned our dishes when we went to leave, I noticed that one of the "clean" water cups had some serious residue from some other drink.  I grabbed it and placed it with our dirty dishes, but still, the baristas should eyeball them before placing them in the clean stacks, so that obviously dirty cups don't end up there.In general, I still like the 61C and most of what they serve, and my friends and I will probably be back, since it's convenient for them and a great hang out spot.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt of half of a star due to the friendly service and delicious smoothie, but they really need to take care of the blatant issues I mentioned to avoid scaring people away.  3.5 stars.From the outside, the 61C cafe looks really dumpy and rundown.  I have walked past here hundreds of times and not come in due to the exterior.  However, one hot day, Laura M's review seduced me to come here to try a smoothie.After trying to order a strawberry, orange, banana smoothie, I was quickly told that they were out of most of their smoothie ingredients.  This frustrates me unbelievably when places put things on a chalkboard that are not available.  It's chalk.  Erase it.  However, with some help from the barista, I ordered a blueberry, apple, banana smoothie ($5.62 w tax).  The smoothie was quite delicious, and they used real fruit and no syrup.  The bananas were a bit brown and over-ripe, but I really loved the unique combination options.  I would definitely like to try some of the other smoothie options in the future.Cash only.

If you are on the west-side and in the need for some decent Americanized Chinese, this is a great spot. First off this place is dirt cheap and the servings are ginormous! The menu is actually quite large for the kind of place that it is, with all the usual suspects (some of them even surprisingly tasty). They have a daily special that is around $3 bucks and is basically a bowl of rice topped with whatever the selection may be. All entree items can either be ordered in a combination form (with rice, crab puff, egg roll) for around $5, or a la carte for around $6.50. The a la carte is a large clam shell full of your choice - my personal favorites are the orange chicken, the house chicken, and the pork fried rice. Seriously, I could probably devour an entire clam shell of their orange chicken; it's the perfect amount of crunch and spice! And at $3.50, I can nosh on a quart of Hot and Sour soup (basically until I can stand no more). The owners/staff are incredibly nice (ex: they literally will call you by name upon your second visit). The decor is really plain, but it's always clean and tables are attended to quickly. They offer take out and delivery (if you are in the general area). But this is one of my goto places if I want something fast. I simply call in my order, hop in my car and in the 5 to 7 minutes it takes me to get there, they have my order prepped and ready to go. Their hours are roughly 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. - Monday through Saturday but if you are on the cusp, I would recommend calling ahead, as on occasion family issues force them to adjust. If you are in the neighborhood of 35th Ave and Thomas, give them a try and see if you don't agree that they are A-OK and recession friendly. : )

I dropped in unexpectedly with CM for a snack around 7:30 last night.  CM was hungry because he hadn't eaten dinner, and we were expecting to try one of the breakfast sandwiches at Delanie's Coffee, where we were originally planning to head.  However, the barista there apologetically informed us that he turned off the oven at 7, since it takes a long time to cool down.  He recommended Carson St. Deli as an alternative place to get a sandwich, which I recognized as a place that I'd bookmarked on Yelp, so we headed on over.CM ordered the Mark Cuban ($8.25), a variant on the classic cuban sandwich.  This version substituted chicken for the pulled pork, a roll for the bread, and was toasted rather than being pressed like a panini, judging by the meltiness of the Swiss cheese.  Although I didn't try it, CM was very pleased with this sandwich, which satiated his hunger well.  As for me, I had to order the Donnie Brasco ($8.25), a layered egg salad and buffalo chicken sandwich, based on other reviewers' comments.  This was one of the more unique sandwiches I've eaten.  It was quite flavorful and substantial, and was bookended by good quality Italian bread.  However, it was one of the messiest sandwiches I've ever eaten, due to the mayonnaise and buffalo sauce and the small pieces of hard boiled egg and chicken.  Fortunately, CM and I have reached the point where we're comfortable eating messy foods in front of one another, so it wasn't an issue.  ;-)The ambiance was surprisingly quiet for a bar, due to the fact that there was only a couple of other customers when we were there, and that the TVs were muted.  We enjoyed the oldies music that was playing, which somehow seemed appropriate for a sandwich shop such as this.  Service from an older gentleman I'm guessing may be the owner was friendly and pretty efficient.  One quirky thing that caught us off guard is that if you eat in, you pay after you finish eating, rather than when you order. In retrospect, however, this makes sense in light of this place being a bar, given that many people probably want to run a tab.  (I didn't think of this since we didn't have anything to drink.)  Although the prices have gone up a bit, we felt that they were still pretty reasonable (total check: $16.50).  Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience here, and would definitely return in the future.I belong to a MeetUp group called "Strange Brew". We're a group of craft beer enthusiast who get together once a month and we each bring a beer that, hopefully, no one has tried before (that's the challenge, finding one during the weeks leading up to our MeetUp). We've been doing this for over three years, alternate between only two establishments; last night it was the Carson Street Deli. I got there at about 6:00, commandeered some tables and looked over the menu wondering what I would get tonight. After a few other members showed up, I decided on the Real New Yorker's New Yorker Sandwich that comes with a mixture of hot pastrami and corned beef topped with melted swiss and deli mustard on a grilled marbled rye. I also ordered a Lavery, Lá Bealtaine White Fire Wheat to compliment it. One of my fellow Strange Brew members ordered the Dizzy Lizzy which is a pita wrap with curried grilled chicken, fresh slaw, dried cranberries and sliced almonds.  She looked at my sandwich and I looked at hers and we decide to trade half of our sandwiches with each other. They were both amazing (if you can say that about a deli sandwich), super fresh and the right amount of ingredients presented with simplicity.  Now can we talk about beer? Twenty craft beers on tap should be able to get you lubed up enough to make your way over to the cooler section where they stock over 300 craft beers. You can mix and match beers of your choosing and if you put together a six pack you get $2.00 off each beer. But what we (Strange Brew Meetup Members) like most about the place though is the atmosphere. This establishment is always spotlessly clean, the wait staff is extremely courteous and attentive and we, as a group, are always made to feel welcome each time we get together here.  What is also cool about the Carson Street Deli is that there's a patio out back with a garden like feel to it that we take advantage of during the warmer months to get away from the hustle and bustle that can be the South Side.  If you can't tell by now, let me just say that I like it there. If you're in the South Side and looking for a good sandwich and a high end craft beer to swish it down with, I would highly recommend the Carson Street Deli. It's so much more than a "deli" thus deserving of a five star rating.

I saw the review of the day today and had to throw in my two cents. This is my least favorite lunch stop I've ever been to downtown. It's usually suggested by someone in the office who just wants a red sandwich meat sandwich and wants it fast. Then the rest of us have to suffer too. Very typical sandwiches like turkey, roast beef, etc, etc. I might like the place better if I ate alot of red meat. The people I go with swear that the "Traffic Jam" sandwich (a cluster fuck of different red sandwich meats) makes it worth the trip. The toppings are very pedestrian and limited. They will charge you to put something "fancy" like black olives on it.I would also challenge the "clean" assertion made by another reviewer. Although they have a ton of employees to run a pretty tight ship in terms of making sandwiches quick and cleaning up, we have had several incidents of finding questionable or disgusting items in the food we've ordered so as to make many  people in my office never want to go back.I give them one star for making a decent sandwich that I could've made just as easily at home and for cheaper. The second star is for their milkshakes which are made with real ice cream in front of you and are pretty good. Go to Sacks, duck and decanter, downtown deli, or one of dozens other downtown sandwich places first before here.

While it won't win any design awards, I did have a fantastic view to the west of a majestic Arizona sunset. I actually ordered to go and was able to sit while waiting and soak in the energy of Thai Rama. A slow Monday night had two straighty couples (yes, you heteros, you know who you are) holding hands and nibbling slowly. The walls were adorned with pictures of Thai royalty. I think anyway. It could just be a promo poster from a vendor. I don't know. And Bud Light signs. Ahhh...America! The Thai beer I enjoyed while waiting certainly helped pass the time. Service here is extrordaniarly friendly, like most Thai places I've encountered. I purposely over ordered as I wanted left overs. Pad Thai. Outstanding. After that I recommend numbers 1, 7, 23 and 27. Paint by number. Order by number. It's simple. And everyone's gonna love it. Thai Thai for now yelpers!P.S. The #18 soup is so amazing...lemon grass and coconut milk. Dee lish!I can't bring myself to give Thai Rama more than 3 stars... I love Thai food, and I wanted to love Thai Rama, but I just didn't.  I thought the restaurant itself was cute, casual, and unassuming... the staff was friendly but not the most attentive.  I was there on a Sunday night recently, and I felt extremely comfortable dining solo (big plus for that).Unfortunately, when I was given my menu, there was a dried up noodle stuck to it, and the napkins on the tables are pretty but polyester and not the best for wiping the noodle off or absorbing anything at all for that matter.  I was also disappointed that I didn't see a thai salad with peanut dressing or summer rolls on the menu.  I decided to order the #6 to start - Lab Gai (finely chopped chicken lightly sauteed in lemon juice with red onion and mint).  Maybe I should've ordered it without onion because onion was everywhere!  The flavor of the chicken was good, but it was difficult to eat with so much onion.  I went with the vegetarian dish #69 (yes, I said 69) as my entree.  Paht Paug Jae or vegetable deluxe.  I requested that they add eggplant and they did - it was pretty tasty and I cleaned my plate with that one.Overall, the meal was ok.  Maybe I'm spoiled by some other thai favorites in the valley, but I'm glad I experienced Thai Rama.  I probably will not rush back, but if you're looking for a decent thai meal and you're in the Cen Pho area, you can find it at Thai Rama.i have never been to Thai Rama. i have always wanted to try it. but it wasn't really close or convenient to go to. i happened to be in the area so figured would check it out. food was less then spectacular. after 20 years...i am not really sure if it's just down graded from quality or bad suppliers. i don't know. the spring rolls. totally from a box, flash frozen. the insides were mushy and the flavors not distinct. also got the won tons. saving grace here. they were good. the pork nugget inside of it could stand to be a bit bigger. it is dwarfed by the won ton wrapper. still was really good. i have chosen to make Pad Thai as my barometer for Thai restaurants I'm going to review on Yelp. if they cannot make this "signature" dish then the rest of the menu might as well be rat poison. the pad Thai was flavorful, the noodles were a tasty pile of mush. it had really long mung beans which i like. so it wasn't all bad. in fact it wasn't bad tasting. but honestly for 9+ bucks. i could have picked this up at Safeway from a box called "Taste of Thai" for 2.50 and cooked it myself. atmosphere is ok. kinda old, cute menus with home made paper. with the menu items printed on a transparency. hmm. now that i think about it..it's kinda cheese. but whatever. service was good. quick turn around. and my glass was only empty twice....but to think about it..they only filled it twice...so it was empty.....so that means...i was thirsty..and my drink was empty. hmmm ok thats kinda nit picky. it was fine. 3-4 stars if the food was umm fresher. or at least not supplied by sysco. in conclusion. this place might have been around for 20 years. but when there are not better options. [Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, even Thai Hut...] and your the only Thai restaurant in a 20 mile radius...you can last. but i shouldn't need to point out...that you have some serious competition in the area..and their prices are about the same.i really wanted to make a funny review about this place. but lets face it. Thai food is seriez bizness, only deserving a serious review.7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great.... All dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup... its new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P walks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K... As soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :) the lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?! in the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed... as soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said "Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? "um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... " he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird he got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score! once we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing... he had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli... so the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm then he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!? once we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying "pardon me or excuse me" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified! End Result.... Good Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :) The Service was nice... Nice atmosphere... Horrible date... Wish i had had better company :( oh and i Tossed out his number...

Review Text :
I'll be honest, I completely forgot Yelp existed.  Lots of my friends are Elite Yelpers, and since there haven't been many events over the past few months, their conversation topics have switched from "Oh my god the next OYE sounds fuckin awesome!" to "I haven't gotten any free food/drinks and Yelp branded schwag in forever waaahhhhhh!!!!"  So when I went to the UYE at The Vig Uptown last night with Georgie S, stuffed my face with cheap grub and Bud Lights, stuffed my pockets with lets just call it "a couple" Yelp coozies and packs of Orange-heads, I remembered this little website and figured I'd fill you in on what I've been eating since the last OYE.  God damn that was a long sentence.KFC Double Down muthafuckas!!!!!!!Yes, that's right, I've literally eaten KFC Double Downs for every meal for..... when did they come out?...... I don't know whenever they came out.  If you don't know what a Double Down is, then you obviously don't watch enough ESPN and other channels that target fat lazy dudes.  The KFC Double Down is the brainchild of what must be the fattest genius on Earth, designed specifically to trigger the glutton-reflex in the human brain.Picture this:Take a delicious chicken sandwich from your favorite joint.Put bacon and a sweet tangy sauce on it.  Hungry aren't ya?But something is missing right?NOW TAKE THOSE TWO PANSY ASS PIECES OF BREAD, THROW THAT SHIT BACK INTO THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW, AND SAY "GIMME ANOTHER PIECE OF CHICKEN BITCH!You don't need bread!  Just put the freakin bacon and sauce IN BETWEEN the chicken filets!  You like grilled chicken?  Get grilled chicken.  You like fried chicken?  Get fried chicken.  Or you can follow in my Chicken Jesus-like footsteps and get one of each.  QUADRUPLE DOWN!!!Seriously, I know most of you are all "GROSS!!" and thinking that I must be a raging alcoholic or constantly high to like this thing, but trust me, IT. IS. INCREDIBLE.  Eat a bunch of salads all week and tell yourself that you're healthy, go get a KFCDD, a 40 of OE, and sit on your ASS and enjoy the wonders of a true poultry masterpiece.  Plus you need protein homie, you're lookin a little flaco.  Yeah, you.  If you need me, I'll be in the drive thru.

Restaurant name  Mario's Westside Market
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I never would have that Mario's Westside Market served Louisiana style cooking.  A friend told me about this place so I thought I'd give it a try.  As soon as I walked in the place, the cashiers greeted me but the customers were staring me down like they never seen a Filipino kid before. Oh well.  I went straight to the back of the market where they served the hot food.  Everything looked good and fresh!  I asked if there was any deals.  The guy helping me said "the deal is, you hook the jar up, I hook you up.". So I did just that.  They charge by the pound here just like Smiths or Albertsons would charge you where the hot food is.  I got 2 lbs of catfish, 1 lb of porkchops, a pound of Mac n Cheese, and half a pound of potato wedges to-go. I took it home and the smell blessed my car and my house.  The catfish was cooked to perfection, crunchy on the outs and tender on the in's and the seasonings were just right! Porkchops were OK, it was way too salty. The Mac n cheese was the best, no complains about that.  But the potato wedges were horrible! It tasted like it was cooked in very old oil and it was stale! Ranch or ketchup couldn't save it.  Other than that, I had a good experience with Mario's.  If I want some good catfish and Mac n Cheese, Mario's is the place to be.I would've given this establishment a complete 5 star rating but there is only one thing that honestly brought the experience down, the sides. I had initially heard of this place through friends and coworkers and was strongly recommended. All I ever heard about this place is that the catfish was to die for. A friend from work offered some to me on one occasion and though it was a bit cold when I tasted it, the crunchiness and flavor of it was so amazing. I needed to try it fresh, and soon!I decided to go a couple of weeks later, and though it may not be in the best location it is completely worth going to! The line was a bit long when I arrived but moved fairly quickly. I decided to get 4 catfish filets and a side of hush puppies (an order has 8). I took it home, open it up and inhaled that delicious steam that rose from the box, this alone made my mouth water. The crunch on the filets wad that of fried chicken but not heavy or greasy. Still very delicate and light. A small drizzle of lemon or hot sauce is honestly all you need as you want to taste the freshness of this fish. On to the hush puppies which was the reason I did not give this place 5 stars. When I first bit into one I noticed that it was spongy. A spongy feeling that happens when things have been reheated a few times. Seasoning and flavoring was there but not freshness. Marios is a great local gem that everyone is Las Vegas needs to visit at least once. The cooks definitely know what they are doing with their fish.Because I'm all about that catfish-- and Mario's is some of the best I've EVER had. Being from south Texas, it's been hard to find southern-style gulf seafood, but Mario does catfish right. The batter is light and full of flavor, you won't even miss the tartar sauce and the hot sauce is entirely optional. Sides of mac and greens taste like they were made with someone's grandma's recipe, they're that good. Location is a bit odd- head in anyway, and hang a left to  the back of the store. If there's a line (and there will be), suck it up and wait. Buy by the pound or purchase a meal, but don't go without getting catfish. They also offer chicken tenders, wings, and a bunch of other sides, but it's probably best to stick to the basics before branching out.Eat in at their small dine-in area by the coolers of sodas, or grab yours to go- if it's too far from home, you can always take it to the nearby Lorenzi park. You'll need to break a sweat after eating this kind of meal.

Restaurant name  Prommares Thai Food
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Located on the corner of Torrey Pines and Sahara is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.  The name Prommares is after the Hindu god Praprom the deity of fortune and good luck.I love coming here for lunch because they have great lunch specials.  It's just the basic Thai dishes, but everything here is always fresh and authentic.  I always get the Pad See-Eew ( I think that's the one w/ the Chinese broccoli and the flat pan fried noodles) It's always perfect and so is the Tom Kai soup.I like that its a small family owned restaurant w/ a small and intimate setting.  It's never really crowded and the service is fast and friendly.Much like my last GF, PTF ain't a looker, but she gets the job done. A-OK in my book. Came in to this small joint around 2pm to pick up some lunch. I was hooked before I even stepped inside. Why? There's a sign on the door "24oz soup, $2". Deal! After being seated, service was prompt and friendly. My order of ginger tofu with rice, (mini) egg roll and a soup set me back about $7 and was the perfect medium heat at spice level 5. Am i going out of my way to come back here? Nah, but I wouldn't hesitate to return when looking for lunch in the area.

Restaurant name  China Harvest Buffet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I wanted to update the review since China Harvest has updated their decor!If you've been there in the last few years, you've seen the weird shade of green that accented all of the white-ish walls.  If you're like me, you grew to like the odd green color for its strangely soothing quality; I can't help but be reminded of a 1940's mental institution.Well that has all changed (KIND OF) since the walls have a fresh coat of off-white-wash, and the accent color has been changed to a lovely, putrid, baby shit yellow-brownish; I can't help but be reminded of the classy and stylish 1960's Harvest Gold kitchen appliances.Technically, it is an improvement, although you have to question the judgement call on the color selection.  Perhaps for the person in charge of that choice, the mental institution green was just a little too appropo?!?They also put up some very nice wide-slat wood blinds with a medium dark wood stain tint.  They do a great job at blocking out the harsh sun, or even harsher Food City parking lot that graces your window view.Still cheap and still usually great, just not consistent.  Another recent improvement is steamed white rice in a rice cooker for you to scoop from instead of from a dish on the steamtable.  Keeps the rice nice and fluffy instead of it turning into crunchy toothbreakers.Still my 4 star goto cheapo china boofay.It is funny how things work. I took my 12 year old here to eat because she wanted Chinese Boo-fay. I decided to look at Uncle Ryan C's reviews because he knows cheap Boo-fays. This one was the highest rated and closest to the house. So how bad could it be. In fact he had lunch here the very same day. Location -1 star, this strip mall sucks. There were guys smoking 2 ft from the door. The building is U&gt;G&gt;L&gt;Y stuff falling off the overhang, bad paint, i almost got ran over walking out to my car, sketchy patrons etc. Interior -1 star this place was a Carrows at one time I am sure of it. When is the last time you saw a Carrows in Phoenix.... yep the decor is that old. As mentioned they recently painted and hung blinds. I could not imagine this place before. Service 3 stars very nice attentive and not intrusive. Food 2 stars at best. The food was just there. Nothing stood out, nothing was horrible. I sampled almost everything there except the seafood. I had made a deal with my colon years ago to stop eating buffet seafood. Ice cream machine -1 star... would have rather had ice chips. I doubt I would be back. There are plenty of other cheap places that have higher quality nicer ambiance and closer to my house.

Restaurant name  Papa John's Pizza
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
After a full day of fighting crowds and traffic, who really wants to cook? Not me. We ordered a pizza online. Papa John's had it delivered in 32 minutes, still hot and still fresh. Good flavor, good coverage of toppings. I'd order from this location again.Tip: Check the specials before you pick your pizza. It's possible that you can get a deal for the same price or less.I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.

Restaurant name  Mediterranean Cafe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If you're looking for a great plate of food in Madison for under $10, you just aren't going to do any better than Mediterranean Cafe. I believe it's run by a father/son from Algeria, so it's more Middle-Eastern-focused, but none of the food is really that foreign/adventurous, just solid, typical Arabic-style mediterranean food. It's unassuming from the outside (and pretty cramped on the inside), but the food is always superb.I typically get the lamb shawarma plate, which comes with lamb, hummus, mixed greens salad and pita bread. The hummus is awesome, and the creaminess is really great in contrast with the vinegar-based salad dressing, which is great as well. The lamb and pita bread are pretty standard, but definitely solid. In my opinion, though, the real star of MedCaf is the deliciously-minty Algerian tea. I'm by no means a tea connoisseur, but trust me: You'll wish you could make it at home. As I said, it can get cramped inside, but if you can get a seat, there's very little wait time. It's a great ethnic interior, with flags adorning the walls. The staff always thanks you when you leave, which, though it doesn't seem like a big deal, is really a nice touch. I do wish it was open more often, but it kind of adds to the exclusivity of the place. A really great eating experience overall, and like I said, for under $10, with an entree and the amazing tea.One last thing: This is a cash-only place, so don't be a n00b and come in without any dough.Let's get this out of the way first:  -Cash Only-Vinyl plastic table covers-No outside food/drinks-A chalkboard menu of items that slowly gets erased as the day wears on-Line out the door, and you can only get a booth during the lunch-time rush if you have a party of 3 or more (They _will_ ask you to move).This place clearly does not need you.  But come here once, and you will realize that it's more about you needing Med. Caf', not the other way around.The food is amazing, and they have something to keep you fed at every-single-price-point:SSB Combo:On a diet,  running low on funds, or just killing time 'til a big dinner later?  The soup, salad and bread combo can be had for less than most things from the S'bucks next door, and will keep your motor running for at least a few more hours.Plates:Hungry out of your mind and looking for a lot of savory protein, creamy carbs, and a bit of crisp clean fiber?The Akin's, Shawarma or Hummus plates all feature their absolutely delicious gyro meat (or optional chicken), creamy rice, and a very appetite-whetting salad.Apricot Chicken:But the crème de la crème in my opinion?  Once a week, when the stars align, the delightful Apricot Chicken may be had.  It's a lasagna-looking item that is very creamy, and runs slighty sweet.  For comparison, the apricot flavor it's somewhat reminiscent of a fine mango chutney.  This dish is _only_ available on Thursdays (Tuesdays need not apply!), and unlike most of their other dishes, will sell out damn fast.  From first-hand experience, if you try to go later on a Thursday, you've basically waited a full week to _not_ eat this dish.Atmosphere:As the 80's motif is strong with this one (not to mention you will end up bussing your own table), I generally prefer to take my order to-go, and walk across to the next-door Starbucks, grab a coffee there, and sit on the rooftop balcony and enjoy my food/coffee/view there.  A further walk puts you at the memorial library courtyard, which also has ample seating.In short:  Bring Cash, and don't let looks deceive you, this place is an awesomely delicious alternative to starving!I tend to avoid eating at State St. establishments, but "Med Cafe," as my friends affectionately call it, is the first State St. establishment that has made me really regret this. Let this be some valuable and vague lesson in life on never giving up. Prices are reasonable, plates are nicely portioned, food is fast, and everything is really good, like catered food good. If I'm ever a few blocks from State St. and it's feeding time, you can be sure I'm there. I don't like carrying cash, but I'll start doing it now. Med Cafe, you've changed me. *shakes fist*Who reads reviews for Med Cafe? Go here and eat their food. Seriously. Go here and eat their food. Now. Take it to the Memorial Union with a book. Or a friend. This is a real restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious. For every time I see someone in a chain restaurant with the same play school aesthetic, I think about how Med Cafe utterly kills it. Their food is so fucking good. If you hang out with someone that would prefer Einstein Bagels over Med Cafe, stop hanging out with that person. That person cheats in Monopoly. That person takes your beer without asking. That person would attempt to steal your girlfriend but can't because ladies aren't property. That person will take you to Olive Garden for your birthday. And that person will also be late and regift you a shitty used present.And it'll be your fault because you knew that person didn't like Med Cafe.

Restaurant name  Rita's Mexican Food

Review Text :
I wan't sure about this place when we first arrived as it is just off the freeway and shares a parking lot with a Mexican auto / tire shop.  However, when you step inside, this little gem looks like it belongs in Old Town Scottsdale.I made a mistake and order my old standby, shredded beef tacos.  Don't get me wrong, they were okay, but nothing like my GF's order.  She order the steak fajitas which were amazing!  In fact, these are by far the best fajitas either one of us has ever experienced.  They came with all the usual suspects, however they are of the highest quality.I want to go back and try more items on the menu, but I am definetly ordering the steak fajitas next time!!!If you like fajitas, you must try Rita's!

Restaurant name  Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
For a long time I dreamed of going to Lo-Lo's.  I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.Finding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  "Lo-Lo's this way!"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.Entering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few "rooms" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  The Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was "ok".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.Service: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that "I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. Atmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be "afraid" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.Overall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking "wow, is that all?" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about.What can I say that has not been said already.This place is a Foodie's version of Crack!I was half way home when I wanted to turn around and go get me some more!OMG! It was just so delicious!! Starting with the giant mason jar of the coldest Ice Tea I've ever had and it was perfectly brewed not too strong or bitter. I got the unsweetened.I ordered a chicken breast with a waffle and a side of mac and cheeseEverything arrived steaming hot, even the syrup! I Love that!My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball, The chicken was so crispy and flavorful, not too spicy or salty but just right, it wasn't even greasy.My Husband got the same with a side of cheesy eggs, He was lickin' his fingers and bobbin' his head.....so what does that tell ya!All in all it was the best we've ever had, We Will be Going back!After the withdrawals wore I off I slipped into a complete food coma and slept the whole way home!There are few places that I return to where I consistently eat as much as I can and then walk outside and dry heave (really the other only places are all-you-can-eat sushi joints).  LoLo's is good, very good, but not great.  The fried chicken is good; the skin is delicious.  The scrambled eggs w/ cheese and onions are amazing, but the waffles are just all right.  The people I go with tell me that the grits are fantastic, however grits don't do it for me.  The amount of butter, cheese, and fried goodness is probably enough to actually kill a small child, and certainly enough to send anyone and everyone into a food coma.  Of course you can get smaller portions than the 'K.K.' (3 pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, eggs, and grits), but why?!  They also serve Kool-Aid and sweet tea, but they're pretty much just liquid sugar (try half sweet tea, half regular).  And the "homemade" lemonade is definitely just made from those powder lemonade mixes.  There's usually a line, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes, and the service ain't great, but that hasn't really ever bothered me (I'm usually too excited for the chicken & waffles to let something like crappy service bother me).  All-in-all, it's a great place, especially if you're able to take a siesta afterwards (i.e., close the door to your office and pass out for an hour).  But I can't say it's better than Roscoe's in LA; I mean, come on, Roscoe's puts cinnamon in its waffle batter, so good .....I woke up an hour later in the passenger seat of my own car, my window plastered with puckerings of chicken-greased flavored lipstick. Apparently, we had met up with Erica O for lunch at Lo Lo's. We drank sweet tea out of Mason jars. The menu had items named after characters from Spike Lee films. There was a "Toy Toy" and a "Betty Boop" in 'Crooklyn' right? I could swear there was a Sha Nay Nay in there somewhere.I was told I had ordered fried chicken smothered in mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Smothered. As in "served as one entity". According to Misty S, I tried fruitlessly to eat the aforementioned mad creation with a fork and knife, to try and give our lunch companion Erica O the impression that I was not, in fact, a gluttonous fatty without dignity, as my mashed potato-flavored chicken was trying to suggest.I had mentioned, before passing out in the car, that I found the waffles to be fluffy bundles of cinnamon joy. And that they tasted just fine without syrup, which was good, because I ended up getting most of my syrup on the damned fried chicki-mashed potatoes.They had offered us dessert afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. If I had just eaten two syrup-less waffles and fried chicken soaked in mashed potatoes and covered in mis-aimed maple syrup, the last thing I'd expect is to be offered red velvet cake. But I'm sure at the time the idea seemed much more reasonable.The food couldn't have been that bad, for though it gave me a "food coma" as the natives call it, I didn't suffer any intestinal woes.The story sounded so fantastic and sensational I almost didn't believe. Surely I would've remembered dining in such a wonderland of soul food stereotypes. I was tempted to call Erica O and cross-reference Misty S' account with one of her own, but we were in the parking lot of Arrowhead mall and I needed a new pair of shoes. Or two.The first thing that I saw, when I walked up to put my name on the list to be seated, were a bunch of white people and an Asian guy.  The girls taking down names were Latinas.  The first thought that popped into my head was "Where all the soul brothas and sistas at?!?"  You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?But, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.  So not cool, when it's already 100 degrees at 10am.  Can you see me sweating?  Not pretty.After a 35 minute wait, we were quickly shuffled into the a cramped little room.  Our orders were quickly taken.  Not even ten minutes later, the food arrived.  My "Toy-Toy" (two fried wings with a waffle) was delish!!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy in the middle.  Finger lickin goodness.  The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.  Despite the crampedness (is that even a word?) of the place, I'm still giving it a full 5-stars.  It's worth the wait and worth being up close and personal with your tableside neighbor.  Customer service quick and friendly.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall place, but that's what makes it even more authentic.  It's unique, has a great vibe and great food.  Next time, I'm making room for some of the red velvet cake.Straight up... I talk too much.I don't mean to... I just do but it might have been a good thing during my maiden voyage to Lo-Lo's. I met fellow yelper Kerstin ordered a two piece chicken with a waffle. I also ordered a side order of Mac & Cheese. I also ordered the Red Kool-Aid which came promptly in a jelly jar! SWEET! I was so excited! :)Then we ordered and waited... and waited... and WAITED.. and of course - I talked... and talked... and TALKED!!At first they said it would be a few minutes... and then they said that they were going to be making more chicken for us and promised it would be worth it. I put my faith in all the other great yelpers who loved this place that it would be in fact - worth it. So we waited some more - the waitress even offered a waffle as an appetizer. (yay!)My first taste of Lo-lo's was... PERFECT! I never had a fresh waffle except for that one time at the Windmil Hotel & that waffle was rubbery! But... Lo-lo's was nothing like that rubbery shoe tread! It was light, crisp, and amazing with it's sweet cinnamon goodness. I loved it! :) I'm now worried that Lo-lo's has ruined me for all the other waffles in my future.And then we waited some more and I talked some more... and then FINALLY our food came... well - most of it. I didn't notice it until I started to dig in to my own food that Kerstin's meal didn't come at first! She had to wait a few minutes for her meal - I felt bad, as I stuffed my face with my crispy fried chicken wing. Which was good, but great? Ummmm... Yeah, I guess it was. It was better than most but it was a little on the dry side. Honestly, it wasn't worth the wait. I could've been home with a bucket of the Colonal's finest 11 herbs and spices in the time it took for them to get our food out! The mixing of the flavors, of the chicken and the sweetness of the waffles was spectactular! Now this is where Lo-lo's shines! The chicken by itself? Meh... The waffles by itself? oooo... together? WHOA! I loved it! :)But I couldn't even begin to eat it all!! There was so much food! I also sampled Kerstin's Catfish which was WAAY yummy! :) So was her green bean & potato side dish. it was hot and spicy and really good with some salt.Overall, I loved the decor, especially the signed autographs on the walls - crazy kewl. The drinks served in mason jars. Even the color of the walls. I dug that the servers tried... but dude - it took us a few times of reminding them of my mac & cheese before it hit the table... WAAAAAY after we each started our dinner. (boo!) And even then - it was sticky and luke warm and lacked... soul. There I said it... a soul resturant's food lacked soul. For real.I'll totally go back, but not with as much enthusiasm as i did the first time, but seriously - the first time is rarely the best time... so here's hoping for better in my Lo-lo's future.I've tried dining here twice.  The first time I visited, the resto was so packed, I waited ten minutes and then left.  The second time, debated on leaving, but stayed.  Had fried chicken, a waffle, cornbread, and the candied yams.  Best thing were the yams!  Chicken was alright.  Waffle was too thin, light in color, and soggy.  It didn't help to witness one of the staff sneaking in the back with a bag of Bisquick while I was waiting for a table.  I thought the waffles and batter were homemade??  Cornbread didn't even compare to Redfish or Z'Tejas!  Honestly, it tasted like the dried versions I tried at Big City BBQ and Marie Callender's... Tsk, tsk.If I were to return, it would only be for the candied yams/sweet potatoes.  Those deserved 5 stars!Can you say "food coma?"OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the "Nay Nay's" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!  I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!Pretty much the most amazing chicken and waffle experience I've ever had.I went to LoLo's with Robert and Bacon on a Sunday morning. We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1/2 sweet and 1/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra. I was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah.... We were checked on several times to see if we needed anything and we were treated cordially. I will visit LoLo's any time, any day as long as someone is there to share the guilt with me!First off, let me just say that this is my first yelp.  Go easy on me.Visualize yourself shitfaced at the end of the night, stopping for a bucket of KFC because nothing could ever taste better than food when you're that drunk.  You with me?  LoLo's is that good, only sober, and in the morning.  Show up there at 955am on a Sunday and you'll see a line of brothas in their sunday best waiting to get in to this place.  And where that line of people goes, I will blindly follow.Because inside you'll find: mason jars (!) of red Kool-Aid, good ol' fashioned Southern sweet tea, or whatever soda you want.  But then there's the plate of fried chicken.  Top it off with red rooster sauce and life is damn good.Alternatives: mac and cheeseThe waffles are good but to be honest with you, I feel like they just get in the way of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  (Sober or drunk)  I mean, you wouldn't just go to the original pancake house and get only eggs and hash browns, would you?  Only a goddamn fool would do that.  No, you are the person that goes to Mastro's for the steak, Sapporo for the teppan yaki, and Red Lobster for the, well, red lobster.  (you know what I mean...)  And since you are that person, go to LoLo's.  Get a jar of drink and eat so much chicken that you want to die.  It's a good feeling.Oh. My. God.How have I never been to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles after 8 years in the Valley? Shame on all of my friends for waiting so long to take me to this hidden gem!!Think fried chicken with your breakfast of waffles, eggs, and cheese grits sounds gross?  Well you have never been more wrong my friend!I don't quite know how, but it was oh so right.  And I am not a big meat with my eggs fan (i.e. steak and eggs) fan in general so no one was more surprised than me when I was left craving some more of that delicious fried perfection after Brad E was kind enough to share some of his with me.The waffles are dusted with cinnamon and melt in your mouth.  The cheese grits are wonderfully authentic to a southern girl such as myself, and let's be honest, who in their right mind would ever complain about a freakin' Mason Jar filled to the brim with delicious kool-aid.I ordered WAY too much food for myself (shocker) so I didn't even get to sample the mac and cheese, corn, and other incredibly enticing side dishes that were scattered about my table.Yes, the place is kind of cramped and you'll wait longer than you want for your food, but deal with it, you'll be thrilled you did.It's easy to like the things that everybody else likes. It's human nature to want to be loved and to want to be accepted. Deep in our DNA, we are still pack animals (as in "a scrum of rugby's", as opposed to pack animals as in "pack all that crap on that animals back and let's go").My sense of needing to belong was what brought me to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles a few years ago, and my sense of "I haven't had a decent chicken and waffles fix for a while" brought me back today!You won't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken...I won't fawn over whoever is in the kitchen turning out delicious waffle after delicious waffle.I can't sit here all afternoon and go on and on about the many delectable sides like the buttery and cheesy grits, the melt in your mouth fried okra, and the gallons and gallons of sweet tea or homemade lemonade that you can consume with your lunch at Lolo's.It's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards, and fish and grits, that you just can't get other places that stir my soul.I'm not moved to hyperbole (pronounced "high-per-bowl":) by the blending of sweet maple syrup, buttered waffles and savory fried chicken on the plate.I am not reduced to tears by some of the best red velvet cake to come out of an oven in the greater Phoenix Area.No, it's the people at Lolo's that make me go back, and the sense of belonging and of being one of the Lolo's "pack"...that and some of the best fried chicken, waffles, grits and cake that you will ever eat.Go to Lolo's...you're family, you should drop by once in a while:)I'm pullin' an Al Bundy on the couch after dining at LoLo's.  You know - he sits on the couch, slouched with his hand down the front of his pants to give more room to his gut.  That's me right now, only with WAY better hair.Had the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes.The platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long.Nathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.  Collard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.  I'm full.  Not Thanksgiving-dinner full, but properly sated after a meal at LoLo's.  The company rocked and I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant dinner crowd!  (p.s. We pegged Whoopie to play Julia.  Ha!)I have a one track mind, I can't be saved, Lo-Lo's is all I craveI know I have to face it -- I'm addicted to Lo-Lo'sFrom the crispy fried chicken, the waffles that melt in your mouth, the attentive service with a warm welcoming smile. I just can't get enough.I know I have to face it -- I'm addicted to Lo-Lo's*yay!* this is my 200th review!!!!Ok, so I wanted to do something special for my 200th review, so I took myself to LoLo's chicken and waffles for lunch today.  I had really high expectations, but left kind of feeling a little let down.  I got there, and sitting outside the front door was some girl who I guess was the hostess.  She asked me how many and I told her it was just me. I felt kind of awkward.  She showed me inside and asked if I wanted to sit at this crammed little bar facing basically a freaking wall.  I asked to be seated somewhere else, as it was really uncomfortable to sit there.  So, she sat me in another room near the kitchen area.  Did this place used to be a house or something?  It had to have been.  It feels like theres a zillon different little rooms with tables.  Anyways, so I finally got sat at a real table.  Mazel Tov.   A girl took my drink order, but the service was slow to order. I waited and waited and finally a server came and took my order. I went for the 2 chicken legs and a waffle.  Service actually kinda sucked, but I'm willing to let it go.  I won't hold it against them since everyone seems to like it so much.So, they bring out my food.  I guess it was okay, but not the greatest food Ive sunk my teeth into. I surprisingly was full when I finished.  the chicken was good, but I think the waffles is what got me.  It came with a nice amount of butter, which I smeared all over the waffle, and then drowned it in syrup. I liked it!  Thier butter really made a difference.While I was eating, I was happy to see 2 autographs of the Harlem Globetrotters players on the wall, both of which I obviously know.  Impressive!Needless to say, I guess I was expecting more.  Service was spotty, unimpressive, and actually kind of sucked.  Food was decent, but not earth shattering.  I will probably return, but probably not for some time.OM Heavenly G!!!  Who knew fried chicken and waffles went so well together!!!  My daughter was in heaven!!  She loved her chicken and she doesn't eat much meat at all but the crispy fried chicken had her knawing on the bone.  I ate my entire plate and so did my daughter.  And she has been asking to go back ever since.  And the sweet tea....YUM!!  It was just right, not overly sweet.  I don't know that a place like this exists anywhere in the Northern CA/Bay Area but someone should open one!  For now this is one reason I'm glad I live in Phoenix.....I will be a frequent customer.  The inside feels like you walked into someone's house and I never would have known it was there since it's in a non descript part of town...kind of industrial.  We got there pretty early and by the time we left, the place was packed!  I have been craving this chicken since we went there...I know we will be back!!!  And often!Props to Flow Rida:Jim W had the Fried Chicken [Chicken]Cornbread on the side [On the Side]The whole plate was lookin at meI  hit the food  [He hit the food]Next thing you knowJim W gonna be back to  lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo Them plates full of foodAnd the Waffles with the syrup [With the syrup]I turned around and gave that big helping a go [Hey!]I hit the food [He hit the food]Next thing you knowJimmy ate at lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo  I ain't never ate nuthin that made me say Yo,this crazy good food for not a lot of doughMight have a million calories but that's alright ya' know,Them waffle cakes, they win place and showSo tasty, it was consumableProfessional, flavor incredible Awesome fried chicken [Chicken]Sides I must concur [Must Concur]This food could give the food scene a stirI  hit the food  [He hit the food]Next thing you knowJim W gonna be back to  lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo lo-loWell I finally ventured to the south side to try out Lo Lo's. Let me start by saying it ain't Roscoe's. I still prefer Roscoe's fried chicken. I think this is a better to go spot than a dine in. The restaurant is very cramped if you are claustrophobic don't dine in, this place is smaller than Matt's BB! I mean you gotta go outside to change your mind. I had to take off a star for the cramped quarters. Then I had to take off another star because it was hotter than hell in there! I was sweating like a sinner in church! Did they even have air? That is not cool literally! I like that they use mason jars to serve the drinks. But they were even sweating before the drinks got to the table that's how hot it was! The staff was very friendly but we had 6 different people come to our table?? We didn't know who our server was. One person came and took a drink order another person delivered it. Then a third person asked if we were ready to order. Then a fourth asked for our order we gave it. Then we had a 5th person who brought the food, and a 6th that we paid the bill with?? What the hell was that about we didn't know who to tip. We also had to sit for what seemed like an eternity on the sun to get our bill paid. For as small as Lo Lo's is they have to many people running around there not a very good use of funds if you ask me. They have about a dozen tables there and I counted 9 people working the floor. That's crazy. Now on to the food, I order fried chicken, smothered potatoes, and buttered corn. I had to laugh when a girl across the room wanted to order grilled chicken and asked what are the potatoes smothered with. This is southern cooking, soul food. It is smothered in gravy! Duh. I thought the chicken was very good and large pieces too. The smothered potatoes were very good just needed a little salt. The buttered corn was right on point. My friend got the catfish and chips. The catfish was good I still prefer Honey Bears Cat! The fries were good too! All in all I think Lo Lo's is A-ok, It would rate better if the restaurant was set up differently and they would use the air conditioner!Wasn't really what I expected, eating at Lo-Lo's. But, I should share that I am not a huge fan of fried chicken to begin with. That said, I can now cross "Eat at Lo-Lo's" off my "things to do at least once" list. Dottsy described the chicken perfectly. It was not greasy nor soggy. I did not find it especially flavorful but did pick up on the baking soda. I was expecting a much denser waffle but found it to be thin and limp. The mac and cheese was super creamy and had hints of cream of mushroom soup. Nothing was really memorable for me, except the collard greens. For some reason, that's the flavor that remains most vivid. They had a delicious healthy greens flavor with a nice chili flake kick. So, Lo-Lo's didn't knock my socks off but Lo-Lo's isn't really for me. It's for people who love fried chicken... so, if that's you, I suggest you not miss this place! You'll probably really like it!!Lo-Lo's is rigoddamndiculous. If you don't like this place there is something absolutely wrong with you.Came here for #smunch this past Saturday morning with some of Phoenix' finest ... and I am positive no one was disappointed.. I got the Betty Boop which consisted of a juicy breast of chicken and a large, butter soaked waffle with hints of cinnamon.. when I say butter soaked, I am not even exaggerating. Delicious! Being the fat kid that I am, I also ordered a side of smothered potatoes, ie: roasted taters drenched in their homemade gravy. FYES! FTW! I also got Kool-aid. In a mason jar. Why did I ever stop drinking the stuff? I don't know. Memories of childhood immediately flooded my mind along with a 5 hour long sugar high. I probably gained 5 pounds, but whatever.. This food takes you into instant Utopia, followed by an instant food coma. I think we had about 5 different servers as well, but how can you complain about that? They were on top of their game!Do not come here if you are trying to eat healthy or have issues with cholesterol and/or get annoyed with really loud drunk/hungover people (depending on the time of day you come, sometimes they're open till 3am). Oh, and don't even worry about the location, safe no, sketch yes, worth it, absolutely. AmazingaZING!I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has "Chicken & Waffles" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.Damn.I've had fried chicken.I've had waffles.Who knew that they were really meant to be Together, on the Same Plate!?  Not me, at least until I was introduced to Lo-Lo's.  The Pilgrimage to this wee building on a small side street in downtown PHX was made on a cold, rainy Sunday - perfect weather for comfort food! After strategic review of the menu consisting of a price volume mix analysis to determine the right combination of entrees and side items to reach Pareto Optimality, my friend and I ended up with a table full of goodness:Lo-Lo plate (2 waffles + 3 chicken breasts), 1 additional waffle, home fries and (no surprise here) mac n cheese.  The food arrived quickly (benefit of arriving right at opening time!), and this is where all conversation stopped.  No talking, just eating and lots of it.  I surfaced for air once or twice to mumble random things about how good everything was, but that's about it.  I don't know how the Lo-Lo's Chicken Magicians manage to make fried chicken that is not greasy - it is crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside.  The waffles taste slightly of cinnamon and I am not ashamed that I used the entire portion of butter that was riding on the top.  All of it.  Hard arteries are strong arteries, right?  Halfway through the mac n cheese I noticed the Red Rooster Louisiana Hot Sauce on the table - liquid fire!  Had to douse the remaining portion and feel the burn...  Yeah!!OK Phoenix, I get it.  I know now what I have been missing all this time.  I will be back in about 4 months, when my cholesterol levels return to normal...  :)Fried Chicken, Mac and Cheese, Red Velvet Cake and Kool-Aid!Now that's my kind of breakfast. Lolo's Chicken and Waffles is a small joint located in a not so lovely residential area of Phoenix . Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome! My fiancé and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiancé and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid. The service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too. If you like Soul Food and happen to be in the Phoenix area then you have to check out Lolo's. This place rocks!I lived in LA for 4 years and ate at Roscoe's a lot. Lo-lo's is better by FAR.Why? One word: gravy. The chicken is tender, juicy, and fried to perfection here. Not overly greasy. The waffles? Just perfect waffles with lots of flavor. The grits? Buttery. The Eggs? Tastes like crack when its scrambled with onions. The drinks/kool-aid? Ridiculous size. The gravy?RIDICULOUS. Getting the gravy on the side is the best decision you'll ever make. Unlike Roscoe's, which pairs regular brown gravy, Lo-lo's pairs some sort of spiced and onioned concoction that reminds me of the drippings gravy you make on Turkey Day. I literally dipped my entire meal (waffles, grits, eggs) in this gravy and still couldn't get enough.My only grip is that the Lo-lo's in Scottsdale takes amex, but this one doesn't. =(.But seriously, Lo-lo's....could eat it every day. IN fact, we we're here for one week, and at Lo-lo's twice.Oh yeah, the Red Velvet cake is RIDICULOUS.During a recent road trip, a chef friend sent me a link to www.roadfood.com so I could try some interesting eateries along the drive from Green Valley to Goodyear. The site suggested Lo-Lo's, and Yelpers agreed. We didn't have to make a major detour off the freeway.We parked on the street and entered a modest restaurant with bars on the window. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=KUUUNkwR7yzcX2o38AYTQQ No biggie. We received a warm welcome and got friendly service.We ordered:* 2 waffles with 3 pieces of chicken - I liked the waffles a lot. I still am not sure I "get" chicken with waffles, but I'm testing it out. I liked the chicken, but wasn't completely blown away by it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=3fY_2vL-zR4xXiKuhDjRgA* 1 plain waffle for our 5-year-old - Thumbs up from the kid.* Grits - Lumpy and plain, but still nice in a simple carb sort of way. As a California girl, I know almost nothing about grits.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=UP5-xhOoSN3C3JLURcrXJA* Chili and corn muffin - The chili was made with beans and beef, and was delicious. The corn muffin seemed pretty dry - waffles are way better here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=PojMqwuCAdilemZILlH1AA* Mac n' cheese - Creamy and satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=apV6OcH9iItBhrm8An33nw* Collard greens - Spicy, the flavor seemed a bit muddled, but it was a-okay. * Red velvet cake - This was one of the best RV cakes I've tried. Incredibly moist (how did they do it?), very sweet, with fresh pecans on the frosting. I recommend ordering a slice to go, since you'll likely be to full to enjoy it after eating all this heavy food. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=l12Isv2RMc5q0LRuYmD4wAI was glad to have found this special soul food restaurant. We left feeling totally stuffed and very impressed.Oh, Lo-Lo's how I love thee...  I catered Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles for a surprise Halloween lunch for my staff this week and it was a huge hit.  I just told them I was catering lunch in, I didn't tell who was bringing the food.  After the food was set up and ready to go I emailed the staff and told them the food was ready and that it was Lo-Lo's.  You should have seen the steady stream of employees that started 'prairie dogging' over their cubicle walls and letting each other know what the big, surprise lunch announcement was!  It was hilarious how fast they scooted their normally slow asses to the conference room to be the first in line for Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles!!Lo-Lo himself (Larry) came out and he made piping hot, fresh waffles to order as the employees all dined on the best fried chicken in all of Arizona, and some of the most delicious mac and cheese and read beans and rice I've ever tasted.    Ohmidog, their food is so damn good...I was the office hero for the day and I couldn't have done with without Lo-Lo's.  Thank you, Larry!  You want to be the most popular person in your office?  Cater Lo-Lo's for your staff for lunch.  You will NOT be disappointed in the results.  ;)This review breaks my heart. A few friends and I met up at the down town location, I was excited to see that the newly renovated and expanded LoLo's was now open for business! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! That's about where the love ends with this review sadly. We were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did. When we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI. Next up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh? My food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that? Ive been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves. Not cool Lolo's, not cool at all. I think its rad that you expanded, but if you cant handle the customer load then whats the point?BLUFGot it to go and glad I did. The chicken was OK but only for the first couple of bites.  The red velvet cake was aweful. BackgroundYelpers let me down on this one.  I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake.  Let me say I didn't have to watch the scale worried of well earned weight gain from this meal.  The chicken was an initial hit but was short lived.  I didn't finish it nor did I want to.  The waffle did not travel well either, it was soggy by arrival (10 mins to the hotel - arrgh!)  nor was it flavored in any manor. I would liken it to the generic bread slices used at other joints for sopping up the grease.  The red velvet was a crime.  It too lacked flavor, was heavy beyond understanding and it hurts me to say this - was only deserving of the trash. wa, wa, waaaa.$20+ for soul food that was so bad.This review should be read aloud in the voice of my dad, which means a combination of Foghorn Leghorn and Tommy Lee Jones.Q: do you like fried chicken? If you answered "yes" proceed to Lo-Lo's. If you answered "no",  then what in the hell is wrong with you? Seriously, go get a chicken leg from anywhere else that sells chicken legs. Go on. I'll wait.Now, look at the chicken leg that you just brought over here to me and compare it to...THIS BIG-ASS MONSTROUS LEG FROM A REAL CHICKEN THAT THEY ARE GONNA SERVE YOU AT LO-LO's!Not only is this leg three times bigger than that lil ole scrawny bantam leg you got, but it's ten times as juicy and tastes like the good Lord done blessed whatever chicken it came from with the most delicious chicken genes he could find! Chicken so good you'll wanna take the bones home with you and suck on 'em later just to reminisce about how good that chicken was.Don't let the rating fool you, the food is great. I have only eaten at the Scottsdale location but my comment is for the Central location.My mom and I went in there this evening after having lunch at the Scottsdale location. We stopped in because the Scottsdale location had run out of banana pudding and i was craving it. I called ahead to make sure the Central location had not run out as well. I told the hostess on the phone that I was heading in to get some "To Go". Upon arrival we walked in and advised the hostess that we wished to place a dessert order to go. She promptly replied that they are NOT DOING ANY TO GO ORDERS!! HUH??? I advised the hostess that my mom and I only wanted banana pudding and a slice of red velvet cake, plus had called just 10 minutes prior. Again she reminded me that they had been advised by management that there would be no to go orders because they "Backed up" the kitchen and delayed orders. Even for dessert that takes 2 minutes???? It would seem to me that if you do not have enough staff to fully run your business then you should probably look into hiring another cook!!! But I must have mistaken the establishment for a restaurant, silly me! After checking with management the hostess returned and reluctantly took my order. I asked my mom if she wanted the Red Velvet cake or the Soc it to me cake. The hostess interrupted to advise me that they didnt have that there. I reminded her that the sign outside stated that it was one of the specials today!! It took longer for the hostess to take my money and give receipt than it took to get my order packaged to go.I love Lo-Lo's. My family and I eat at the Scottsdale location 3 times a month. We get the best service there. I have been to the location on Central twice and twice they have failed to provide any service even close to the service in Scottsdale. I am uncertain if it is the location and blatant disregard for customers or a Management issue. Either way, I will not be returning to the Central location. I live in Central Phoenix and would still rather drive to Scottsdale where my money and patronage are appreciated.This was the second place I requested to go on our trip to Arizona. My boyfriend isn't as into Soul Food as I am, but he ended up loving it as much as I did! We arrived around 11:45 on Saturday morning and there was a short wait to be seated.Once seated everything happened very fast. Everybody who works here is very friendly and we were constantly checked on. We both ordered a "jar of drank," Sweet Tea. It was really good. I could taste lots of honey in it. Yum! They also offer to go cups so I was able to take it with me when we left.My boyfriend ordered Nay Nay's breakfast, two waffles, two eggs, and a bowl of grits. His waffles were delicious, loaded with cinnamon. Loved those. I usually don't like grits, but they were good here. There was so much butter on them, I don't know how somebody couldn't like them!I went with the Lolo's Famous Soul Food Platter, and I chose three pieces of fried chicken, mac & cheese, and smothered potatoes. This platter is also served with a piece of cornbread. I knew it would be way too much food, but I wanted to try it all. Everything was perfect! The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great, chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions. And the cornbread was great too, very sweet.The restaurant is bright and airy and they played awesome music the entire time we were here. The bathroom was very clean. The outdoor patio area was really cute. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! We were both really glad we stopped by here for lunch, we left full and happy. I am sure we will come here again whenever we visit Arizona.By far the best place for some chicken and waffles with a nice tall mason jar full of red Kool-Aid!While some may say the location isn't the best [okay, it can seem pretty sketchy after dusk], the food is amazing!  I usually get the Betty's Boob[a waffle and a breast] and some mac & cheese if I'm feeling extra hungry.  The waffle is always crisp and delicious and the fried chicken is delicious.  Gotta love that savory-sweet combo of a syrup-y bite of waffle with a juicy bite of chicken.  *shivers*The service is always friendly and this place is usually packed. Lo-Lo's definitely lives up to all their hype [don't go to the Scottsdale location though.  Totes not the same.]~!4.5 stars! To borrow a phrase from George Takei, oh my! We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  Our waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. The fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.The main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.The chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  Throughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.To finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.My hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory. I'm fairly certain I ate the equivalent of two days caloric intake. with a smile on my face, I thought dreamily of the Tums sitting on my nightstand at home.Ok.. So I had to call one of my African American friends and ask him "What the HELL is so goddam special about Lo-Los?!!" To which he Literally laughed out loud and said "NOTHING!!"I knew he would have been and have some type of input. He had, and he did. No! I am not racist or stereotyping anyone! I know he loves Fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion.  He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me "you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation." This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.  Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets. The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry. It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it. This place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING. I recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices.For the longest time I put off eating Lo-Lo's because I'm a faithful one to Roscoe's, however sometimes the smell of fried chicken and freshly made waffles are too hard to resist. Just know ahead of time that Lo-Lo's is definitely going to put you to sleep- literally and figuratively!I had to do it the right way and get the obligatory Chicken & Waffles- "Tre-tre" which is two drumsticks and a waffle ... and a sweet tea to drink. Amazingly fried chicken with hot sauce is pure gluttonous heaven, followed with the sweet and crisp waffle. The sweet tea is so, so good it's refreshing and sweet! Also you get it in a large mouth mason jar that is enough for two people!Service is a bit slow, but reasonable for the amount of people dining in and parking may be a bit problematic. Once you step out of your car the smell of waffles wafting in the air will resolve some of that stress- trust.I'm going to say what I tell everyone about having chicken & waffles ... it is one glorious meal, then you feel like garbage afterwards- but it's totally worth it! Speaking of which, chicken and waffles sound really good about now.O:^)Very cute spot customer service is awesome the sweet tea is good we got the catfish  and chicken and waffles. Get of the freeway 10 west 7th Street  lots of parking  and they have take outFor our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some Southern cooking and comfort food so we decided to give this place a try.  We came hungry and left happy!Location & Aesthetics - located on S Central Ave in Phoenix.  It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.  The parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.The restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on.The restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.  Noise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars.My suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left.There's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.  If you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.Menus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated.When you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).  Service - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.  The waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.Food - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans.The wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through.For my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.  The rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it.The chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily/greasy It was truly Southern styled, comfort food!Definitely would love to come back to try those oversized Belgium waffles I was seeing on other folks plates!  You truly won't regret your visit here!

This place is straight up hood.I turned down the street and a dog was just running around. my heart broke for that dog for the rest of the night :( I wanted to take him home, clean him up and give him to someone for christmas. I see this graffiti covered building. only, not really a building because there wasn't a door. just a tiny window. not just any window, but a bullet proof one. with prison bars on the outside? ummmm.......the back doubled as a junk yard. vacuum? check. gnome? check. stray dog? random couch? check. check.my friend shouts- this is it!!!! here it is!!! I'm so excited!!! uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh there were a lot of people hanging by this 'window', they were perhaps homeless?? convicts? i don't know.but this place works like this: walk up to the window, place your order, and wait. my friend was like 'im not bringing my whole purse up there, i don't want to get pick pocketed.' so I said, 'ok, i'll bring mine. it doubles as a weapon'. and we made our way up to the window.the food was dirt cheap- we got two eggrolls, chicken fried rice, spicy chicken dinner, and 12 wontons and diet coke. we spent a total of $16.The food was A-OK and while we waited even more people came to the window. this place was hoppin.  the fried rice was the best- it was super buttery and i loooovvveee butter. the chicken was plain old breaded and fried w a glossy 'spciy' (not really at all) sauce. the fried wontons were just decent, and the eggrolls were delish. but this is not a place i would come back to. for fear of being robbed. call me angel princess, but i couldn't get over the 'ambiance' to chow down and not think twice about what type of quality meat i was eating at such cheap prices...try it if you're brave because it was definitely tasty for the price....i think....

Restaurant name  Steep & Brew
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Of all the coffee shops downtown, Steep & Brew is justifiably one of the most loved. From the subtle scent of coffee grounds, to the soft lighting, spacious tables, and cozy couches, it makes sense that snagging a spot here on a Sunday afternoon can be quite a struggle. However once you are able to settle in, you won't want to leave and there's no need to. With a menu offering customized waffles and oatmeal, and a bakery case displaying oodles of sweet and savory goodness, you can easily make Steep & Brew your home for the day. While the atmosphere and food options are an added bonus, it's the drinks that will have you coming back for more. Don't let the cost of coffee shop bevies scare you away. In addition to their almost perpetual deals on the Hooked app, Steep & Brew offers a frequent buyer punch card that'll set you on your way to a free cup in no time. As far as these drinks go, they've got the best ginger tea in town. Bold statement, I realize, considering I'm a ginger tea connoisseur these days. But Steep & Brew's version is the most ginger packed and spicy and oh so good. Tons of dried ginger goes into the making of this tea and they aren't skimpy.Steep & Brew is also home of my current favorite chai tea latte. Yep, this fragrant concoction is a staple on coffee shop menus, yet few do it right. The evolving variety of chai blends makes for an ever unique flavor trip, and it's our innate curiosity that leads us to try it at many different shops. Crafting the ideal chai, however, is a veritable art form. There is indeed a fine line between excessive sweetness and subtle sugar undertones, an unwelcome abundance of milk and a perfect level of creaminess. If there is one coffee shop that masters this balancing act, it is Steep & Brew. While chai is a black tea and already contains caffeine, if you're in the mood for an extra dose then check out their Dirty Chai. It combines the loveliness of the aforementioned chai with a robust shot of espresso to create a drink that it slightly less sweet and certainly generates an added jolt. Whether you decide to go dirty or not, the chai is a must try.*Expert tip: ask for an added Cuban shot in your chai tea latte, or any other coffee beverage for that matter, and prepare for greatness. This 'Cuban pull' refers to an espresso shot that's been sweetened with sugar during the brewing process, which allows for a nice caramelized sweetness that supplements many of Steep & Brew's drinks quite nicely. Impress your friends and order this guy with your usual cuppa.This might be my favorite on State. It's just a super chill place. I love the upstairs thing they got going on (for the most part...the back part is kind of ugly tbh), it's usually pretty low traffic, the staff are friendly, and the coffee is good. Why 4 stars?I HATE the pastry display. This might seem to be the dumbest reason to dock a star. But I'm hoping that management sees this, because I've talked to baristas about it, and they agree, and have been pushing for this to be changed themselves for a while from what they said. What's the problem with it? There's no door on the back. Why is this a problem? Fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. I would LOVE to buy a blueberry cream cheese Danish...but I can't, EVER, because flies are ALWAYS in there. YES this REQUIRES ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE. It's such a major issue, because it's not just a couple, and it's not just a couple days a week. I legitimately think there is just a colony of them living in that case. Please, someone, put a scrap of cloth over the back. Get one out of the trash and throw it in the wash and put it up - I don't care. Anything is better than nothing at all.... And then I can buy your delicious-looking pastries. :)

Review Text :
So as a native Phoenician, I grew up eating fry bread. But here's the deal... the only place you could get it was at the Arizona State Fair (And believe me, my folks would actually plan ASF trips for that very purpose!) or if the Heard had some special event.What can be said of puffy little pockets of air and chewy goodness fried up in some hideously unhealthy concoction, thereby creating a crispy yum yum shell which you can top to your liking? Holy Mother of God my mouth is watering just thinking about it!The people are friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the sauce should be nominated as a sixth food group in itself... foodies unite and to hell with diets!!! The only downside to this place is that parking can be a nightmare (my sister went once and almost drove over someone napping on a parking block!) But seriously I wouldn't let that detain you from the food inside. : )Whether you are looking for something veggie to carnivore or sweet and sticky the servings are generous. So put on your big girl pants, head on over to The Fry Bread House and pull up a chair.love Love LOVE "The Fry Bread House"Ahhhh Feast Day.... They're awesome. I wish I could bring all you yelpers to my village's feast day.... it's like... christmas in the early fall except the only presants aren't left under the tree but instead are scooped by 60 year old O'odham grandmothers who have been cooking since childhood and only know unwritten recipes that lack measurement, volumetric or otherwise. I could describe to you the food we eat on San Juan's Day (in my village) or Saint Frances Day (Ak-Chin & Salt River)... but if you want a taste of what it's like to line up and part take in the ceremonial meal... head on down to the Fry Bread House.The BEST way to experience this would be to go and order a bowl red chili stew with side order of frybread and if you're interested a lil baby bowl of beans. and then just wait. Dip and scoop the bread in the stew and enjoy. There's NOTHING better than moistening the light and crispy bread into the broth of the stew. It's heaven!ok..so i had a really good friend who took me here a few times...well not here..actually when it was on Indian School and 7th st. it looks so much more inviting now. i just need to bring myself to want to gorge nom nom nom on some fry bread. it's like a big pile of fried crack. you seriously get hooked on the decadent fried morsals. topped with hot and saveries these are just to kill for. maybe even worth dying for. a sweet one is excelent..nom nom nom. ok i think i need to end this post before i eat my keyboard.I had the pleasure of visiting FBH with my fave Foodie Bear and Robert a while back. (Yeah I'm behind on reviews). All I can say is WOW. I have become a fan of FBH. We walked in to a small, clean space. You order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table! My advice, grab a table then go order. For my yummy meal I had the fry bread with beans and green chile. I was delighted to see that I could wash my guilt-ridden meal down with Big Red Cream soda...mmm.. When I bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle. It was so good. I wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce, but it still did the job. We also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread. It was so-so in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on FBH! I will certainly visit FBH again maybe after I do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days... it's just too good to eat on a regular basis!My buddy Kevin N. back in San Jose told me about the Fry Bread House. He said I had to find it and try it when i got to Phoenix.  It sounded like a place I would LOVE.  So when I got here I started looking to see if I could find it.  I drove down Indian School on several occasions, turned down 7th St.....nothin.  After several attempts and a post to Yelpers I realized that I was looking for 7th AVE and not 7th ST.  Doh!!  With that issue out of the way, I made a trip over last week and found it!!  The parking lot of pretty full.....good sign in my book, and it looked like a little house on the outside.  We walked in and picked up a menu.  I wanted to try it all but I finally narrowed it down and ordered the Hominy Stew.  My daughter had some fry bread with cheese.  We were greated warmly, ordered, got our drinks and sat down to wait.  We did not wait long for our food and out came the fry bread and the stew.  My daughter LOVED her fry bread with cheese.  That is her kind of thing.  The hominy stew was perfection!!  I love hominy and there were chunks of tender beef in a nice broth.  And a giant piece of fry bread to go with it.  I was so full when I left.  I totallly loved it.  This is a great place!!  A nice little hole in the wall that serves up big portions for small prices.  You can see the ladies in the back cooking up  a storm!  This is such a little gem of a place.  I only wish that they could take all the calories and bad things out of the fry bread....but then it wouldn't be fry bread and it wouldn't be nearly as good.  *sigh*  I can't wait to go back and try the tacos, the green and red chile, or any of the other amazing sounding things they have on the menu!!  Seriously, get to the Fry Bread house now and enjoy!!  Special thanks to Kevin N. for telling me about this wonderful little gem!!Miss you Kevin!!Hmm... I'm not sure what I was expecting from my first taste of Native American food but, my Navajo Taco from The Fry Bread House was did not live up to any ideas I had.  The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-/When I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food. So, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... I'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.  Prolly won't see ya there.I've been hearing about fry bread house for awhile now. So when I moved into my new home and found it right next door to my neighborhood dive bar, which does not serve food, I was understandably excited.  You know what you need whilst drinking cheap beer? greasy food.  This isn't greasy bad, like dripping and wet, this is good.  This is fluffy warm fry bread, with delicious spicy chorrizo, and all the fixings.The prices are good, the staff was friendly and quick, and the food? oh yes, I  will be back.Also, the leftovers with a fried egg cracked on top, a great breakfast the next morning.  really.

Review Text :
After having eaten at Golden Buddha, China King, C-Fu, and China Chan, I have to say that Great Wall is probably the best place to get dimsum in the Valley.   China Chan comes a close second with better har gau and egg tarts.The Chinese New Year special dimsum - pig trotters with black moss - was delicious.  Apparently it's super labor intensive so is only offered for a limited time.  The shiu mai, steamed tripe and spare ribs were cooked and seasoned just right.  The taro puff had great taro flavor and tasty filling with only a hint of oil.The har gau skin unfortunately fell apart and the egg tart crust was not as flaky as China Chan's.  Overall, the flavors were good, fresh and a nice variety to choose from.Ever since I started getting daily e-mails from my bureaucratic overlords reminding me of the impending layoffs, unpaid furloughs and "department consolidations" I have to look forward to, I've been cutting back on going out and actually enjoying myself. Mostly because they cut all my hours and I still need to find a way to pay my therapist.So for the last week or so it's (haha, proper use of the apostrophe, bitches) been ramen noodles, rice, ramen noodles, peanut butter, and ramen noodles. I've been trying to make the most of it. I look up ramen recipes on the internet. I make aesthetically pleasing bentos out of them. I even put pictures of my lunch on my livejournal, perhaps to maintain the illusion that I'm "challenging myself" rather than desperately clinging to the edge of poverty.Alas, no how I try to psyche myself, there is no pick me up for the buzz kill one experiences when eating 15 cent noodles in front of your computer when your stomach and smug sense of culture are screaming for something...more...Like dim sum. Like Great Wall's dim sum.This morning I was stewing another batch of "failure food" when the insane craving for dim sum hit me like homosexual tendencies striking a fundamentalist preacher giving a sermon on how G*d hates Rastafarians.On the outside, Great Wall looks like another two-bit strip mall attraction. You know, like all the stores next to it. But inside it's like the dining room of Hotel Awesome, where somewhat discontent-looking servers push around carts of delicious and deliver plates of FUCK YEAH to your table where you and your party can divvy them up/fight over them. Whatever fits your interpretation of Darwinism.To be honest I'm surprised more people don't fight over the food.For a mound of their delicious lo mein I would probably break a chair over someone's face. For a plate of their pork buns I would falcon punch someone in front of their kids.This may seem a little aggressive...but it can be a fucking battle royale in there.Especially when you don't have anyone in your party who speaks the language."Uh, yes, I'll take some of that, no, that, yes the thing with the shrimp in it. Oh, and some of that, too. No. To the right. Yes. Oh shit, where'd our ticket go?"I remember watching a Muppet Babies episode once where the children were eating gruel or something and they suggested trying to imagine it as something tastier.I tried that. It's a lot harder than it looks.You swirl those nickel-and-dime noodles around on your fork and you try to imagine crab puffs or plates of peppered shrimp or mango pudding.You try to imagine being surrounded by all your friends, plus some people you've just met, plus a whole restaurant of people speaking in their cafeteria voices (i.e. screaming at the top of their lungs).And then you open your eyes and take a bite.And you realize that you're alone in front of your computer screen with a mouth full of chopstick because in your daydreaming you drop your ramen all over yourself. Fuck.I would crash a mini-motorcycle into someone's groin right now for a plate of their lumpia or shrimp dumplings.Dammit.Does anyone need someone to paint their nails and take them out shopping? I can't keep living like this.Best advice I can give you about Great Wall is to BYOA. Yep.I said it. Bring your own Asian. Thankfully our group of 10 had two. It was critical in navigating the ENORMOUS amounts of food and certainly critical in deciding which things the gringos could handle.Thumbs up to postickers, egg rolls, chow mein noodles, shui mai and other various dumplings. And a big phew for a tutorial on how to eat fresh shrimp. "Peel off the shell, suck out the brains and then eat the rest."Yep. This is where I swig down a cold Tsing TaoAnd the chickens feet. Oh for the love. The freakin' chicken feet. "Just suck off the skin and throw the foot back on the plate."Yep.BYOA! I'm telling ya.I had a BLAST. Carts were everywhere. Service was friendly and swift. Ten of us ate and ate and ate for $200 including tip. Oh. Also one of my Asian American diners informed me that the one man pushing the "porridge" cart only stops at the white people tables because the "porridge" is absolutely frightening to see. Sure enough. He stopped by our tables and scooted quickly by those tables full of Asians. I love a place with a sense of humor. Great food. Great fun. Great Wall.Who knew in midst all of the Mexican restaurants, you'd find a diamond in the rough for Chinese food.  Arizona doesn't have many Chinese restaurants to begin with, however this place rivals the places in CA.  It's not the place for ambience or mood, but the food is the most important for the Chinese and this place is great for dinner or dim sum.   Notes for ordering dishes:I loved the garlic pea sprouts/shoots.  Not all Chinese restaurants this vegetable, but this place makes have it fresh and crunchy and just enough garlic flavor to give it that extra pizzazz.  What I noticed is that this place serves unique fried noodles.  Perfect for vegetarians, this place actually cooked crispy fried noodles unlike most other Chinese restaurant that just comes out with soggy noodles.  Another dish I recommend is their spiced salt tofu. (jiao yan tofu).  Well anything with the spiced salt (jiao yan).  They deep fry the small pieces of tofu or whatever other "jiao yan" producing a crunchy crust and mix it with a salty seasoning and jalapenos.  Great for an appetizer!  My family and I also had their steamed whole fish.  Light flavor and prepared beautifully with the entire moist fish out on the table.  Just the sauce and rice alone tastes just as good.  Be sure to try their walnut shrimp.  Be sure you have a big mouth to fit one of these jumbo shrimp in one bite.  The sauce covering the shrimp has just the right amount of tanginess and sweetness that I'm looking for without being too thick.  And the sweet crunchy walnut complements the dish as well.Ordering the right dishes can make or break your experiences.  For this restaurant, be sure to pick seafood, their specialty.  They have live fish, crabs, etc in clear tanks so you can pick out your dinner victim.  And of course pick fried anything, especially with their spiced salt (jiao yan).Notes for dim sum:Great Wall actually has a unique set of dim sum choices that you can't find anywhere in the valley (at least the Chinese dim sum places I've been to).  Although it's a bit more expensive than the other places in the valley I've been to, but it does taste better overall.  Even the basic dim sum dishes like shrimp dumplings, shumai, and chicken feet simply taste better and I would even say taste better than some CA restaurant.  Who'd thought?  Because the dishes are small, you can try many of them and of course I would go for the fried stuff.  :-) However be careful.  Keep your eye out for the moving carts, if what you want has been sitting there for a while, wait for a new batch.  Cold Chinese food just doesn't taste as well.  Only the tin dishes that are covered are fine, because their still hot after the servers make their rounds.  Go on the weekend for a wider selection and be prepared to have a wait.  But the wait isn't that bad compared to some places I've been to in CA.  Great to go with a medium sized party so you can taste more variety, but not have to wait a long time for a table.Overall, this is a great place to get great Chinese food if you live in the valley and don't want to make a 6hr journey to LA just for good Chinese food (which I have done before).Dim Sum fans look no further! (unless you live on the other side of town, like me).My office used to love the Golden Buddha at the COFCO Center. When it closed, our monthly cravings for Dim Sum went unsatisfied until we heard about this spot. The parking lot is worn down and the location is not close to us. Upon entry, we noticed the clientele matched the cuisine - always a good sign! The seating is much like an adapted ballroom. It looks like they may hold wedding receptions or small events there. The Dim Sum cart came around, and to our joyous surprise, the waitress was one of our old friends from the Golden Buddha!! And, the Dim Sum must have come with her. The pork and shrimp dumplings were very tender and tasty. Careful, though, they're piping hot. The seasame and meat-balls were also good along with the shrimp egg rolls (come in sets of 3). Wash it all down with some hot tea and you're in for an excellent, authentic tasting Chinese lunch.This place has been here for years. For years! I have been coming for years. For years! I still think this place has the best combination of quality dim sum, decor and other menu items. The variety here is just awesome. Golden Buddha, China King, Mekong Plaza, they were decent. Those places were good because you don't really want to travel that far for dim sum and those places were in their respective areas. Except Golden Buddha closed. But for a complete experience, go to Great Wall. You should go on Sundays around 10:30am. That's when their menu is at it's fullest. Asian people go out Sunday mornings haha. There might be a wait but carts will come by more often, more items and you get to see a lot of Asian people. There are also items that are not on carts. Like giant noodle dishes. Don't miss out on them!My wife and I arrived here around 11:00 there was an extremely  Long line, but it moved fast. Inside the place was packed. There wasn't any additional seats, they were booked to capacity. When we checked in with the hostess we were asked if we would be willing to be seated with other people. We said no problem but when our name was called we ended up with just the two of us at the table.The dim sum experience is not for everyone.  Those not accustomed to the noise and crowds should stay away. The place was Jam packed with Chinese families which was a good indication of how the food would be.  All the carts came around frequently. Service was standard for a Dim Sum restaurant. Nothing much to complain about or compliment.  This place was really crowded. It was a bit uncomfortable because the tables are really close to each other, and the aisle aren't hat wide. With the carts going around the place it can get super cramped and uncomfortable. Oh, it was also super noisy, but that shouldn't be a surprise for such a crowded establishment. The servers pushing the carts around were hard to understand so I have no idea what we had or what was in the food but I can tell you we enjoyed all the dishes we picked.None of the dishes really stand out. The food was good, not spectacular, but Just your standard dim sum fare. With the exception of drink refills because no one came around to refill our beverages.FOOD: The menu is standard Dim Sum. PRICE: Expensive -This accounts for why I rated the place only a three. My wife and I spent $30.00 on lunch and didn't really have that much food. I can't imagine what families must spend here on a big meal.   ABIANCE: Nothing fancy but you don't come here for the ambiance you come here or the food. SERVICE: . CONCLUSION:  The food was decent and the price was high for what you get. The décor was non existent and all tables/chairs were all covered and not the most comfortable. However the Great Wall managed to satisfy that dim sum craving but was not even close to the best I've ever had. The search continues. RETURN  FACTOR: 90- 95%************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENTI've been to Great Wall many if times but this is the first with the new owner. I knew him from another restaurant he used to own. Anyways, I went her for dinner. It wasn't for any old dinner but for a Chinese New Year Banquet. This was a celebration with a 10 course meal. So it was supposed to be special. We started out with the Assorted Cold Appetizer Platter which included jelly fish, long thin strips of tofu, thinly cut slices of beef and seaweed salad. It was very different but good. You really never get this dish but at banquets. After this, we had Hangzhou's West Lake Minced Beef soup. It had tiny pieces of grounded beef, tofu, and egg (I think). Very good soup. Then we had Shrimp with Glazed Walnuts that had some shredded carrots on the side. What can I say. Very good. Shrimp, walnuts, and carrots were great. What I really enjoyed was the Fish Fillet with Sugar Peas. The fish was so tender and seasoned perfectly. Wow. We also had Cantonese-style Deep Fried Crispy Chicken, Cantonese-style Roasted Duck, "Lohan" (monk-style) Sautéed Assorted Vegetables, Baby Bok Choy with Mushrooms (huge mushrooms), Yangzhou-style Fried Rice. The chicken and duck were amazing. It was a whole chicken and duck. Very tasty and very moist. The Lohan had all sort of Chinese vegetables I've never heard of but really good. Really different. The Bok Choy and mushrooms were really good. To top our meal off, we had Sesame Seed Sweet Rice Balls. You can usually get this at dim sum places. It's a small tiny ball with sesame seeds on it with some black beans inside. Sweet and chewy. Really good. So this was a banquet with lots of tables which meant the servers were just bringing out dish after dish. You eat a little of each dish and then boom your really full with some really good Chinese food. So if you ever have a chance to go to a Chinese New Years Banquet give it a try cause the food is always outstanding.Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple.  I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart.  From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music.  Cheers!Much different experience the second time around. The second time reveals a disturbing issue. Well this is absolutely disappointing to write. Especially after writing a favorable review of Great Wall the first time around. But our experience here was not good during our last visit.First, we were not acknowledged when we came in the door. We had to pardon an employee (who appeared to be doing nothing) to take us in. He then proceeded to take us to a booth after we requested a table and chairs. We asked again to be seated at a table and chairs and he finally obliged. We were given menus and that's when the real trouble began in terms of service. First, we ordered a lot of food. 2 main dishes, 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an extra side dish to split. It was my last night in Phoenix so I wanted to go all out and sample some different things. Besides, we have the money so who cares right? Well, the drinks came and when we ordered the server let us know there were no BBQ pork ribs, but didn't offer an alternative. When I picked something else, he rolled his eyes and said "So you really want pork?". Yes. I do. So we waited for our appetizers, only one of which came out before the main dishes. The others came out with the dinners. Now the food was good, I have no complaints there. But when the person bringing us the food came out, she would't even look at us. The feeling I was getting was that they were either disgusted with our presence or just didn't care to talk to their non-Asian customers. I say that because the servers were "chatting up" the Chinese folks at their tables (it wasn't a busy night only a few small families), but they were literally ignoring us and a hispanic family sitting adjacent to us. I wouldn't normally write about that but it was so egregious I have to say how it appeared to look. I wish I could say it had something to do with language barriers and being comfortable with your native tongue maybe, but they spoke English fine from what I saw and it just didn't feel good to be ignored. Anyway, no refills on tea, water, or our main drinks were given. When we were done, we were ignored for 20 minutes until I glared at another server who was having banter with an Asian couple near us. I guess he told our server to bring us a check. So we pull out the Amex and what do you know? For the first time all night our server immediately comes over and says in perfect English "we don't take American Express" (even though the tray the bill was on says "Amex Preferred", but that's neither here nor there.Wow. Once it was time to pay, he's on my shoulder like a parrot. Prior to that, he wanted nothing to do with us. Finally, the woman who came out to put the food in 'to-go' bags literally ignored us even after I smiled and tried to talk to her. She turned her head away when my date tried to thank her for putting everything in bags for us. And our sending off? Waiting another 10 minutes for someone to come take the card before giving up and walking to front and giving the bill to someone who appeared to be a manager. No tip given. You've got to be kidding me. In the end this experience wrecked what was supposed to be my new Chinese food place. The service ruined what was great food. The feeling I got while there was that they didn't particularly care if we (non-Chinese customers) were there. And that is really sad. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.

Review Text :
I am guilty of eating at this location from time to time as it is close to my home. I have to say I normally like Dairy Queen! It takes me back to the 80's when life was easy breezy! Mmmmm Heath bar blizzard, such a treat! Cherry dilly bar, mmmmm yummy! My issue and complaint is THIS location only! I finally decided to write my review to help others avoid this train wreck of an operation! If I can save one person from eating at this location then I have done my duty! Food is never made or cooked properly! Corn dogs are still frozen in the middle. Blizzards have very little mix ins! Always skimpy! If I order a snickers or heath bar blizzard, come on and put some in it! Cheeseburger tasted fowl and I can't describe the taste and odor other than the memory of tossing it into a bin labeled TRASH. Prices are high for the amount and quality of food you get. The wait for food is ridiculous, after visiting a few times and waiting 20 minutes regardless of what I ordered I knew this place had issues. I should have never returned after my first visit however I was open at the time to give them another shot. Always a long wait and disappointment in what I ordered. This store is clearly a franchise, they are not playing by the rules that is for sure. They cut corners beyond reason and it shows in their service and quality. The staff at this location leaves a lot to be desired. I have cut this location out as an option, it no longer exist to me. The drive thru set up is ridiculous. Try driving in an inside circle and talking through a cup and string speaker system. Stay away from this location! They are only consistent in BAD.This location has been written off of my list for good!Yes Dairy Queen ,an American Favorite. Everyone loves DQ! Though over the years the lce Cream has changed, but what has not.It is a cheap place to go , to get some old time fav's!The Dilly bars and Buster Bars are still around and still pretty good.Though I would like a little more fudge on it.The place is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful.So very much worth a stop in.

Restaurant name  Farm Basket
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Farm Basket is probably not the cleanest place in the world to eat. In fact, a few insects from inside the restaurant attached themselves to my wife as we were leaving. This place is a grimy and greasy!  My son's head smelled like fried chicken for the rest of the day.  That being said, I didn't want to wash his hair- because I liked it!No joke, this place is great!   For lunch, I chose the 2 piece fried chicken meal (white meat) with mashed potatoes, gravy, and a delicious roll. The chicken was so juicy and seasoned perfectly. Translation - no salt or pepper needed, which is usually the first thing I do to fried chicken. I usually don't like using my hands to eat food, but I had no choice with this chicken. I felt like a fork and knife would have slowed down my eating process.  Instead, I shoved that chicken in my face and made all kinds of embarrassing animal noises until there was no meat left on 'dem bones. My wife opted for the cluck-e-tos, which were chicken taquitos with lettuce, cheese, and salsa. I was able to sneak a bit of these crunchy delights while keeping an eye on my chicken to make it wasn't going anywhere.  I have always associated taquitos with those frozen things that come in a 96-pack at Costco. This experience has made me a believer in this Americanized appetizer. The only thing that would make these better would be guacamole. (I'll trade the lettuce in for guacamole any day)My kids tried the chicken fingers which I rank third on the list of menu items. The chicken wasn't nearly as tender as the fried chicken, and was not anything special to yelp about.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention those incredible French fries. These thin cut fries were cooked perfectly, and had just the right amount of seasoning. In fact, next time I will sub out the mashed potatoes for the fries instead. The staff was super friendly, and the food came out really fast. However, the dining area is small, and is not wheelchair accessible. All 6 of us were crammed into the back corner trying our best to not kick each other under the table.  But, with food this good - I can put up with it.  I won't go anywhere else for chicken--EVER!I do not have nostalgic memories to inflate my rating of this business, being that I neither 'grew up' on Farm Basket (I imagine I would not be as strong and healthy if I had) nor even ever heard of them in any way before stepping in to the lone remaining area establishment on account of needing calories FAST. PRO: The calories are indeed delivered to you fast. Seriously no more than two minutes after stepping through the open doorway I had my food in a tiny white bag -- seeping grease from it in various spots -- in my hand and on my way. CON: The food provided was grossly over*priced as well as fairly unimpressive. If you are going to charge Chick-Fil-A or Raising Cane's prices, I expect it to be close to the same quality (minus the unabashed homophobia and Jesus music playing in the case of CFA).PRO: They are a non-chain business (?) in a world of chains galore. CON: They won't be an any-type of business if they keep salting their fries so heavily that they will single-handedly kill all of their loyal clientele. My blood pressure might have tripled succeeding eating my small fries, which had more salt on them than I have had in months, combined.Conclusion: Their tagline is "We're Carried Away With Quality"; the truth is that they are carried away with their use of salt. Do not recommend unless you are suffering from dilutional hyponatremia. - ESo these guys have been here forever I heard. After coming here, WHY is my question.First of all, I was looking for a chicken combo meal. You know, a couple pieces of chicken, fries, and a drink. Let's see.......you can have a sandwich combo, a chicken finger combo, and a clucketo combo. They have a chicken combo but it does not come with a drink. That's not really a combo dude! So after looking around the place, I noticed everybody that was eating didn't have any actual chicken on their plates. All I saw were chicken fingers, sandwiches, and clucketos (chicken taquitos). As if that wasn't enough of  a clue that the chicken wasn't good. So I opted for the Gobbler Combo, which is a turkey sandwich. The turkey itself is a breaded patty and deep fried. They give you a small package of mayo to flavor it, which I thought sorely needed it. The fries it came with were dry and covered with a lot of salt. Sadly, it could not save those poor potato sticks. After forcing myself to eat the turkey sandwich, against my better judgement, I actually wanted to try their chicken so I got a leg and a wing. Might as well have been a piece of rubber and styrofoam. Service was mysteriously fast. After further observation, it looks like they cook everything in advance and put it under warmers. I know this because not one second has passed since I hand over my debit card, they have one of the cooks handing me the two pieces of cardboard......err I mean chicken in a bag. I literally saw him pulling the chicken out of the warmer. So after taking a bite which should have been a nibble, I was afraid it was gonna bite me back. I would not give this stuff to a starving homeless person. That would be considered an insult. So to the reader, please, PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE. To the owner, since you have been there forever, I assume you got nothing to worry about since you got some people to actually come back and eat here.In the words of Drake, the Farm Fries here "be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there." In theory, anyway. Fries plus chicken gravy (with pieces of fried chicken) and shredded cheese, in a giant portion, for $4.  Except the gravy could be better, and the cheese is cheap and rendered almost tasteless. But if you can overlook the fact that the product could be better, it's excellent for drowning your sorrows in on a bad day.That being said, the chicken is largely regarded as mediocre and I ordered the clucketos and was underwhelmed as well- crispy, topped with lettuce and cheese, served with a side of salsa, but stuffed with chicken ground so finely as to make me suspicious of it's quality. And "The Gobbler" is basically a dry-as-ashes fried piece of poultry (you can't even taste that it's turkey), about on par in size and appearance with the "Chicken Littles" or "Snackers" at KFC, served with packets of cranberry and Miracle Whip. Not only is the sandwich sad, small, and disgusting, but it's not worth more than a buck or two.And whoever created Miracle Whip should be burned at the stake.As others have said, order was ready in a flat two minutes- which is remarkable. Frankly I'm surprised the clucketos were so crisp because I can't figure out how they cooked them so fast. But those fries, man... it's actually kind of a blessing they're not better. I mean unless your life goal is to weigh four hundred pounds.I love this chicken joint!  The only disappointment in this place is its so far from where we live and it's the only one in town. The chicken, mayonnaise and cranberry is the bomb!  The drive thru is a tight squeeze coming in and out but when the food hrs my taste buds I forget about the drive and the drive thru.  That's all I have to say about that.

Eat N Park is not my favorite local chain.  The food and service is constantly hit or miss across the chain.  This Eat N Park, however, is one of the few non-smoking, late-night options in Squirrel Hill, which takes it up a notch.I usually order the American Scrambler, which is just a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich with a fruit cup and potatoes.  It is reasonably priced and enough food to fill me.  Stick to simple things when you order here for the best results.The service is usually friendly, and I like the remodel a lot.  It's not always fast, but it is the best late night option for me!

Review Text :
John Mull's Meats also does BBQ catering under Road KIll Grill. 2008 Taste & Sounds of Soul Winner.I ventured downtown to the Taste & Sounds of Soul Friday & Saturday to indulge in some good bbq and soul food.Friday night was a packed house with long lines and a huge crowd enjoying the entertainment on the main stage at Fitzgerald's.I walked up & down the tent area of vendors and there was about 8-10 food vendors serving bbw,asian,seafood gumbo,turkey legs,giant cajun shrimp,fried catfish,shrimp and hushpuppies,funnel cakes and lots of pies and cakes.The lines were outrageous. H&H Bar-B-Q with a big red smoker trailer had a line of 50+ people about 75 yards long the longest by far.Phat Katz BBQ had 30-40 people waiting. Usually long lines and full parking lots are a sign of excellent food, service,etc.This would not be the case here.Road Kill Grill was the 1st stand in the food court and the line was short because it moved rapidly.I had the 5-bonz/w tips rib dinner w/2 sides for $10-I had mac n cheese and macaroni salad. I also ordered 2 sandwiches-a pulled pork and a beef brisket. SOdas were $1.The ribs were rub no sauce. Nice smoky taste very tender and very meaty. the tips were the best. juicy and oh so yummy.The mac n cheese was better than I've found at any storefront BBq and the macaroni salad was great too.The pork sandwich was great, sauce had a little zip and the bread was very fresh and quite remarkable.The beef brisket was some of the best I've had could've used a little crust & rub but very juicy & tender. Sauce on the side.I wish they had a stand at Lowe's or Home Depot or something because this guy knows his BBQ.Fantastic Barbecue!!!! I've waited an entire year to come back to this event and eat at this bbq stand!!! Some of the BEST BBQ anywhere!!!I of course opted for the 3 meat & 3 side meal getting Ribs,Pulled Pork,Brisket plus baked macaroni and cheese and macaroni & potato salads. 3+3=$16 well worth it.Bottled water & Canned Soda were only $1 too!!! The food is ordered at one end and served at another to keep it moving-other vendors have 30+ minute wait because of their disorganized service.Immediately upon opening my order I noticed I had been given a leg & thigh of bbq chicken and NO pulled pork or Macaroni and Cheese. When I went back to explain they graciously provided me the missing items. and I ended up with an extra piece of chicken. Fair enough for the inconvenience;)The food was really good. Perfectly cooked barbecue. The ribs falling of the bone tender and moist with a great bbq sauce on the side. The brisket -some of BEST ever!! Tender melt in your mouth sliced paper thin!! The chicken was smoked through but moist and tender plus it had a little kick to it. The Pulled pork was great but was already sauced(personally I prefer adding my own) The macaroni & potato salads were homemade and pretty good but the baked macaroni and cheese was a little overdone and mushy with no crunchy topping to indicate it being BAKED mac n chz and no real cheese flavor.John Mulls Meats operates a butcher shop in NW Las Vegas and does event catering but this event is the ONLY time they come out during the year so get down to FREMONT and check them out before it's too late. Taste & Sounds of Soul goes on through February 21st!!!I love butchers.  I especially love a butcher shop run by a family who knows their meats, and John Mull's is it.  I've been to a few others around town, but this place is spotless, the entire building is like a walk in freezer (meaning fresh meat out of the back and stays fresh while cutting and bagging) and it's a simple set up.  You have the cash counter up front where you grab a paper that has this 2 page list of all the cuts you can get, and then the old man behind the counter -- who is totally awesome and very sweet -- helps you with thickness and cooking tips.I cannot believe how many varieties of meats they have available, and what made me even more intrigued was their smoked bacon slabs, done right in the smoke house on site.  Oh yeah, baby.  Sweet lovin' bacon slabs, cut to order.  I grabbed 1.5 lbs of their smoked bacon (without rind cause they suggested it that way), two 1" ribeye steaks cut FRESH from the slab, and 4 pork chops cut thick enough for pan frying cut fresh off the slab.  It was fun to watch, fun to order, and a shocker at the register.All that meat, ALL that meat was 25 bucks.  WOW.  I freaked out.  I know that the pork was at least 6 pounds and the ribeyes were 18oz each, and then the bacon...all for 25 bucks?  I was happy as can be walking out of there.Screw the supermarkets.  I'm buying my meats from John Mull's from now on.  They have all I need when I need it.  If you're looking for a butcher up in the northwest area, head to this place.  It's worth the drive, and was a well kept secret of the neighborhood until now.  PS: They cater, so if you want great bbq just ask when you get there.  You can also call and order things in advance.Show me the meat! This is where you need to go in Vegas to get all of your carnivorous cravings satisfied. Yeah, it's a little off the beaten path, but follow Google Maps and you should be A-OK. Don't let the exterior fool you, either, 'cause this place is legit.Walk inside and you'll be handed a menu and will most likely have to wait in a short line to give your order. Or call ahead and they'll have packaged and ready to go for you. It's basically a giant meat locker with a friendly staff behind a counter ready to chop, grind or whatever else you need them to do to your meat. So many choices, too! We got several things, but what sticks out in my mind was the sweet sausage. Yeah, I said it: sweet sausage. Make all the jokes you want, 'cause I don't care. It was tasty.I'm all about supporting small local businesses but I was lied to by John Mull employees about something I consider important.I called once and asked if they carried grass fed, pasture raised beef. The woman who answered the phone said yes so I went down and purchased two steaks. I verified one more time before purchasing that the beef was grass fed and again I was told yes. The steaks tasted great, but grass fed beef has a particular taste.Feeling skeptical, I called again today to see if they had any more in stock and to get the name of their supplier. The woman who answered the phone consulted with someone else and told me they don't carry grass fed beef, nor have they ever.ANYBODY CRAVING SPOTTED DICK?!!If you've seen King Ralph with John Goodman, you know what I'm talking about.I stopped by this afternoon to use my $40 groupon. If you haven't heard of this place, you probably would never have found it. It's a hidden gem in a residential area.I picked up 3 Ribeye ($11.99/lb) and 2 lbs of Korean Style Ribs ($5.49/lb). You can have the steaks cut to the thickness of your liking. I had the Ribeye for dinner tonight and it was so much better than the Ribeye that Wal-mart sells for the same price.Both ladies at the counter were very friendly. I will mos def come back to try some of the other meats.After seeing this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, I decided to give it a try.  Guy F. was raving about the place.   Ask any BBQ pro about boiling ribs and they will look at you like you just stole their elderly mother's life savings.  John Mull's boils their ribs before finishing on the grill but Guy stated "this is competition meat".So I make the trip there, really strange looking neighborhood and place.  Tiny on the inside, luckily it was not crowded.  I ordered a 2 meat combo.  Ribs and links, I told the young man preparing my plate that I wanted my sauce on the side, he said they don't put sauce on the meat, sauce is over on the counter.  Good sign.   I looked around as he was preparing my plate then went over to put some sauce in the little containers.   All set, got my food and headed out the door.  Not really any place to eat there except for some picnic benches outside but it was far too hot to be outside so I decided to head to the nearest covered lot and eat in my car.    Finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast!Opened my tray and found that this idiot kid covered my ribs with the links that were swimming in sauce!!!!  I literally wanted to scream!  I told the idiot I didn't want sauce on my ribs yet he proceeded to put the cut links and sauce on top of my ribs.Anyway, started on the ribs and they were not very good at all, tender but no flavor at  and the sauce sucked!   The links tasted like hot dogs.   Overall not good Q.Thanks Guy!!!   I was at another restaurant and the owner claimed that Triple D requests a fee for them to visit your restaurant.   I believe that.  Have you ever seen Guy say "that place was just OK'??I am not a big BBQ eater when I go out to eat.  All of the chains I've been to just don't live up to a good home BBQ'ed meal.  I am pretty sure their motto is "skimp on the meat because they can't taste it through our 'award winning' BBQ sauce!"  John Mull's puts these chains to shame and lives up to any claims about being as good as home BBQ!The place itself resides on a small ranch and has that Old Nevada feel to it.  As a native to this state, I love that about the location.  A dirt parking lot and old wooden fences/structures make me feel like I am on a Nevada road trip.  There is a small out door seating area, but I prefer to take my food over to the Tenaya Creek brewery and have a nice IPA with my BBQ... SO GOOD!So far I have had the brisket, the ribs, a little bit of pulled pork and chicken.  This place has the best brisket I have ever had!  The stuff sits in it's own juices all day, and is incredibly tender and juicy.  "Wow" is all I can say about the brisket after hating this cut from other places.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  Just amazing stuff.  Same goes for the pulled pork and chicken, although the pulled pork is a bit on the salty side.  The BBQ sauce has a thick, lightly sweet quality to it.  I prefer the spicy one (it's not that spicy).  But you really don't need BBQ sauce at all.  That is how good the meat is.  The dry rub kicks the crap out of every place I've been to.  All of the sides are amazing as well.  The only thing I am not a big fan of are the desserts, but that doesn't matter to me because the "dinner" portions are so huge that you won't have room for dessert anyway.  Really the dinners are enough for two maybe even three people with that brisket.Folks, seek this one out.  Take it from a guy that doesn't do Generic Dave's Memphis Subpar BBQ, The BBQ is outstanding here.I went here with three of my friends for the first time. They are like in the middle of nowhere, and we thought we were lost. The place itself looks like a ranch! (wait maybe it is a ranch lol) because they butcher their own meat. So you can count on the meat being extremely fresh! Now be forewarned, this isn't a place to come to with a large group of people to actually eat here. You are supposed to order your food and take it home as they really don't have much seating area.As for the food, wow, I ordered just the hot links sandwich, and the sauced version of the hot links blew me away. The portions are large and the price is fair.If you are tired of going to Lucilles, Famous Daves, Tony Romas ribs, and other chains, then come here and try this place out! True southern-like BBQ house.Oh and this place was featured on the "Food" Network for top BBQ houses in the country by the way!If you are looking for good ole' southern eats, look no further. Seriously. Stop. This is the real deal.I have been lucky enough to eat at John Mull's throughout the years. My most recent was when we had them cater for our company lunch. Best decision we had made in a very long time.They set up in our parking lot and you could just smell the good food cooking away.We had ribs, chicken, brisket, sausage, mac & cheese, baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad, peach cobbler, rolls and assorted BBQ sauces.The mac & cheese is simply some of the best I have ever had. It was cheesy but not greasy. It was ooey and gooey and the perfect balance of flavors.The baked beans! HOLY MOLY! I am not a big baked bean person but these beans were delicious. They were mixed with ground beef and a concoction of seasonings that just kept me wanting more. Out of the meats, the spareribs were my favorite. They were tender and just delicious. The brisket was good too - juicy and smokey. The chicken was actually pretty good too. Not dry at all. The sausages, well who doesn't like a good old sausage.There is never a reason to pass up on something this good. I promise. Good food, Great portions, Reasonable prices.This review is for the Road Kill Grill section.Looking for this place off of Thom Blvd, you can easily miss it if you are not looking hard enough. What's funny is that they have two decent sized signs and I still almost ended up passing them. You are actually in the middle of a neighborhood and all of a sudden you see several small ranch style buildings. It kind of looks like a western setting for an old cowboy movie.Once you find the dirt/gravel parking lot, make your way to the building that says John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill. When you come in, the bulk meat ordering section is to your right while the hot food section is to your left. You tell the attendant behind the hot food counter what you want and they will put it in a to go container for you coming from pans that are already prepared. What I ordered was the 2 meat combo for 14 dollars. The 3 meat was only 2 dollars more but damn, I know for sure I am not gonna finish the 2 meat. Meat choices were Hot Links, Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, 1/4 Chicken, Rib Tips, and Tri Tip on Tues and Thursday only. I chose the Brisket and Pulled Pork. Comes with your choice of 2 sides which were Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, Baked Beans, Green Beans, Cole Slaw, and Mac n Cheese. I opted for the Potato Salad and Mac n Cheese. If you refer to my picture, its a lot of food!So when you pay towards the end of the counter, you have a choice of regular or spicy barbeque sauce in a little to go cup. I sampled both and the spicy was better than the original. Not make you sweat spicy, but just that little flavor kick to get you going. What's pretty cool is that they have the sauces in warmers so you get it heated.Once you pay, you have the option of going home, staying in your car, or look for one of several tables outside to sit down and eat. Remember, the building you came from only houses the butcher meats and hot foods only.Service is decent. From my assumption if the place is packed you will definitely have to wait a while. Of course you can call ahead and pick up also.Some random info. Their bathroom is literally in the back where all their pits and smokers are so if you need to go you can probably catch the cooks in action. I suggest getting the 3 meat combo to share cuz its a lot of food and you can save money! The roads leading up to their place is all 25 miles per hour. On certain days, cops like to meet their quota by hanging out around this area so watch your speed!So overall, they have some decent barbeque here. I just wouldn't make an extra special trip just to eat here though.Some decent 'Que on my side of town!I'll admit, I had to check out this place after it was featured on "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" on the Food Network.  But without this tidbit, I might have never knew the place existed!Funniest thing about John Mull's is that it is basically located in the middle of residential homes.  Yes!  When you GPS the address you might think you're being led to the wrong place.  But keep truckin' because the BBQ joint is on property of what looks to be a ranch house.  John Mull's eating area shares the common space with what is essentially a butcher block.  Get a whole cow, some eggs, and then a meal of BBQ afterwards?  I don't see why not.While the market has been around for some time, my review basically goes over the BBQ station.  It used to be just a shack when they first started, lately I hear they have a small food truck type deal to serve folks as well.  They need the help, John Mull's can get busy for lunch!  Typically it's take-out, but they do have a small seating area with about a dozen bench tables or so.  If it's full, eat it out of your truck tailgate like most folks do!I am not an expert on BBQ by any means, but good food I can do.  Sure, you have your naysayers that go on and on and on about how their BBQ sauce is from a bottle (I can confirm I think it is), but really I don't care.  The meat itself is not artificially processed.  Trimmed in-house, and smoked in-house!  Flavor of the BBQ is what is necessary!  John Mull's makes some mighty decent 'Que.  Easiest thing on the menu to try if you're a noob to this place is just to go with a combo meal.  A 2 Meat Combo will run you about $14, and a 3 Meat Combo will run about $16.  When it's the wifey and I we usually opt for the 3 Meat Combo and share.  Be careful, it's a lot of food!  The 3 Meat Combo will easily feed a third person.  Combos come with your choice of meats and sides.  Meats include:-Hot Link-Brisket-Ribs-Pulled Pork-Pulled Chicken-1/4 ChickenTheir strength lies in their ribs and brisket I think.  I like their pulled pork, but if I'm having their ribs (which I always do) I compliment it with the brisket.  The ribs are cooked just right, requisite pink ring around the outside, meat pulls off the bone (but not too easily), super moist and tender, finished on the grill with a slathering of BBQ sauce right before serving.  The brisket is flavorful, and just plain juicy, thanks to the lovely fat cap that surrounds each one before smoking.  OK, if you just say 'brisket' when you order your meat, you will most likely just get the lean end of the brisket.  Which is not dry, but not as near darn tasty as the fatty end.  So be specific on which part of brisket you want, lean or fat.  I will usually ask for a 1/2 portion of both.  For sides, Road Kill Grill has some options too:-Potato or Macaroni Salad-Coleslaw-Baked Beans-Mac & Cheese-Green BeansUnfortunately, no collard greens or black eyed peas!  But you can't have everything.  I will mention that the green beans are just mainly reheated from the can, so I mainly skip that.  The baked beans are very good, and their mac & cheese is actually pretty stellar.  I also enjoy their potato salad.Combos and meals come with slices of white bread if you request, but don't forget to ask!  It won't always come with it included.  Also, get some extra BBQ sauce!  I know the sauce may be bottled, but they let it simmer on the side most of the day, so the flavor does concentrate nicely.  The hot BBQ sauce has a nice kick so watch out.  Kaboom!  It's overall great eats, just don't forget extra napkins and extra wet wipes!  It will get messy.  Which one of you city people eat BBQ with a knife and fork?  That's what the white bread is for!Another item I usually order when we eat at Road Kill Grill is a sandwich.  They load these suckers nicely so you get a nice portion of meat and sauce to bread.  Basically a meal in itself!  I enjoy the hot links sandwich in particular.  This with extra hot BBQ sauce on top, and a side of coleslaw?  Classic.  BBQ can be a very picky topic, so you will see tons of varying reviews on John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill.  This is because depending on what side of the country you are from, you have a different taste of what BBQ should be.  Some like tomato based, some like vinegar based, some like mustard based, and so forth and so forth.  Some folks like more smoke, some folks like less smoke, Hell, some folks like their BBQ baked in an oven instead.  But no matter what, we all like good food.  And I think Road Kill Grill overall has good food.Give them a try for yourself.  You might like, but then again you might NOT like.  Many reviews for this place are in the 3 or 4-star range, I tracked over to the 4-star area because I like it here.  In a place like Las Vegas it's difficult to find good 'Que that's not from a place like Famous Dave's or Memphis Championship BBQ.  Nuff' said.Would you look at that?  If you drive to the Northwest and take a few lefthand turns, you end up in a stockyard in Kentucky!  Almost.  From the minute you get out of your car and see the line wrapping around the shed, you know you are in for a unique experience.  Get in line on the left for an awesome lunch or turn to the right to go into the deli and order fresh meat.  We chose lunch.  John Mull's is good.  Really good.  I can't go so far as to say it's better than Rollin Smoke, but I will say they are totally different animals, offering totally different experiences.  There's just something about ordering at a food cart and eating outside that adds magic to BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and stole a rib from my boyfriend.  The ribs!  So tender.  And the potato salad and mac n cheese were both incredibly good sides.  Apparently, they are only open til 6 p.m. so go early and go hungry.  Portions are huge!Whenever I'm making a special recipe, I come here for the meat. LOVE the short ribs!Call ahead and order for pick-up so you don't have to wait. It gets pretty busy in there. Right now, I'm looking at a line outside for their barbecue. I've brought friends here to eat and they've enjoyed the food. I still haven't found the best barbecue, you know, the kind you crave and drive many miles for? But, for the meantime I'm good with John.This has definitely been on my Vegas Eats bucketlist for quite some time. The reviews have always been great, but it's a long ways from my Henderson digs, so I hadn't had a chance to test out some Road Kill Grill. Good grief was it worth the wait. Rather than enjoy the best BBQ in Vegas alone I decided to bring an entourage. It was just before the Christmas holiday so I grabbed all of my closest co-workers to enjoy a fun holiday lunch with one another. I'm pretty sure between the entire group of 6 we ordered the entire menu. Personally, I went with a 3 meat combo that included ribs, chicken, and pulled pork. For my sides I went with a double load of mac n' cheese. That was an excellent choice as their M&C was off the hook. The ribs had fantastic flavor. I do like them to fall off the bone a little more, but they weren't tough at all. The pulled pork was the best I've ever had and they give you a mountain sized portion. The chicken was my least favorite as it had a little bit of a gassy flavor. I think it might have been a bit of smoke overload, though it was incredibly tender. Next time I would probably drop the chicken and go with the brisket or a hot link since those looked so good. The icing on the cake was the corn bread you got with it. Sweet and the perfect complement to a great meal. The 3 meat combo was literally enough food to feed 3 people, so be advised that you will likely have leftovers if you go this route.The seating area is very informal. Picnic style which is great for a large group. Only warning I would give is that it's all outdoor seating, so weather could be a factor. They do have heaters that keep it relatively warm on a cold day. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill. Next time I'm definitely planning on visiting the butcher shop to load up my freezer. Great stuff!I love me some bbq!! Mmm mmm....when I smell that smoke and see the beautiful site of ribs, sausage and brisket on the grill I truly get excited. This place came highly recommended on Triple D, thus we took a venture to see what all the hype was about. Let's talk about the location. It's located in the middle of a neighborhood which kind of caught me off guard at first. You see all these houses, and then WHAM....there is this house that has a huge grilling operation going on behind it. The people that work here are very friendly. Laughing, smiling and helping you make a good choice for what to eat. I ordered their 3 meat combo which came with brisket, pulled pork and ribs (disclaimer: they don't offer burnt tips! That's a bbq no no in my book). For my sides I had greens and yams. The cashier kind of twisted my arm to get their banana pudding for a dessert.After we sat down to eat, I first dove into the yams which was delicious. Good texture and nice and sweet. The greens were also really yummy as well. They also give you a cornbread muffin which was good, not the best I've ever had....but good. Not really sweet like I like my cornbread. Now the meat. I saw no smoke ring on any of the meat I ordered, so I was concerned about how this was going to taste. I first bit into the brisket which was a little disappointing. I don't think the smoke got into it at all, and the flavor was just ok. The ribs were really good. Not very much smoke, but they have a great dry rub that packs in some good flavor. The rib meat was also a little tougher than what I would like, but it was still good. The pulled pork was really the savior. Great texture and huge flavor!Now it was time for the banana pudding. This thing was amazing! Nice and thick pudding with big time flavor. The Nilla wafers were nice and crunchy, and the bananas weren't brown. I will say this is top 2 best banana puddings I've ever had.....next to my moms of course ;-)Overall, I liked my experience here. Good atmosphere and good food. If you've read my other reviews about Texas bbq, then you know I'm a fan of how they do it in the south. This place is not as good as good as Texas bbq. Not enough smoke, and the meat texture needed a little bit of help. If I had to break it down, I would give this place a solid 3 star on the bbq and a 5 star for the dessert and customer service.Can anyone outside of Texas beat them in bbq? I'm still on the hunt!Cheers!Worthy of the hype. Wait for Saturday lunch wasn't too bad just after noon, line itself isn't that long but goes a bit slow. Employees are working hard with smiles on their faces, though.But you come here for the food! The three meat plate is the best value, and the portions are huge- this is easily split between a couple, add on a dessert if you dare. The HOTLINK is "easily one of the best I've had," says the BF. We both thought the RIB TIPS were amazing, and were both a little pickier than necessary about the BRISKET- blame our time in Texas for that, but it's still lightyears better than most other versions here in Vegas.The sides are pretty solid, too: the COLLARD GREENS are seasoned well with meat and onions mixed in, but the MAC AND CHEESE wins all the awards here- it's one of the best versions I've had outside of someone's home. The CORNBREAD and PEACH COBBLER also were really good, and clearly homemade.Menu is small, but everything we tried was really well executed. Location has some limitations, but I like the down home style. I'll definitely be keeping it in mind the next time a barbecue craving hits.I decided to take a little adventure to North Las Vegas. Since I'm never in the area it made sense to try to hit as many of my bookmarks as possible. John Mull's was one of these locations. Located in a more residential part of the of town, I was surprised when we arrived at the restaurant. It has a rural BBQ restaurant feel, which I really liked. We stood in line and I decided to order the three meat combination with rib tips, ribs and pulled pork with a side mac & cheese and baked beans. I paid at the counter and they they give you a receipt to hand to the guys in the trailer. It was a little disorganized it the guys made sure to take all the customers in the proper order. They informed me that they were out of rib tips and I opted for the hot links instead. I don't usually like sausage but this ended up being my favorite part of the meal. The ribs and pulled pork were also good but the standouts were the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was so cheese and delicious. It was some of the best I've had in town.The service was really nice and friendly. I was especially impressed by the guys serving up the food. They ran out of cornbread and when I asked about white bread the guy went out of his way looking for some for me and was so apologetic when he couldn't locate any. I'm not a huge BBQ fan typically but I can't wait to try this place when I find myself in North Las Vegas again.I hadn't been by John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill in over a year and was craving some chicken, so I decoded to brave the lunch crowd for a cure. This place is in a residential neighborhood which surprises some, but I'm used to it from growing up in the neighborhood. I came here long before the Road Kill Grill opened when we would bring the deer my dad brought back from hunting each year here for processing. There is a decent sized dirt lot for parking, but just know that depending on the time of day you stop by might depend on you getting a spot or not. When I pulled into the lot this last visit, I was the only car and literally every single car that was behind me pulled in and there was no parking spots just that fast. That meant the line inside was going to get long fast, so I picked up my pace and headed in. I was greeted with a welcoming "hello" and then a girl came over and wrote down what I wanted. The guy behind the counter packed up my order and asked if I wanted any extra BBQ sauce. They have picnic tables in a couple areas outside if you want to eat out there or you can get your order to-go. 2 Meat Combo ($14.65) - I chose chicken and sliced hot links for the meats. All combos come with two sides and I chose baked beans and macaroni and cheese. For an additional $2.75 I also added a side of green beans. The chicken fell off the bone and had such a great taste! The chicken is worth coming here for alone and tasted just like I remembered. Chicken craving cured! I liked the sliced hot links, yum! I did like the BBQ sauce and liked that it was a sauce with actual flavor instead of just being overpowered by nasty vinegar. The macaroni and cheese here is hit or miss from what I have experienced and it's all about the texture that's different. There might be a time when the macaroni and cheese is creamy and oh so good and then there are times like my last visit where it's pasty and not so great. I enjoyed the baked beans however can do without whatever meat is in them. Bacon in the beans would be more what I'd prefer, but I have family and friends that love the baked beans just the way they are here. We all have our own tastes! The green beans were good and I liked the random pieces of pork mixed in. Oh yeah, you get to pick either a roll or corn bread to go with your meal. It's a lot of food and depending on your appetite it could easily be shared with someone. Just come by and try the chicken and thank me later :)

Attention folks! Do you like hard, flavorless, uncooked boxed brown rice that taste like it was made weeks prior? Do you like ordering a chicken dish and it is mostly vegetables? Yeah! Awesome, then you will love this place then if you answered yes to the following questions! If half of your taste buds are in operation then please AVOID this atrocity at ALL cost! The only thing that are ok is their crab Rangoon's, other than that go take a big chunky dump in a bag and dig in, you would love that more than any entree from this place! Waste of money! Bad Bad Bad food! I feel ripped off! $13 bucks down the drain on garbage!Don't do it! Please...don't don't do it!

I ate here a few Saturday nights ago with my girlfriend for dinner.  I have been coming here for the past five years or so, more often than not for their bubble tea and have only ever eaten here once before.  The inside of the restaurant is fairly small but not overly crowded which is nice.  On one side of the restaurant is an enclosed counter where you can order food to go or watch them make the bubble tea and the rest of the restaurant is made up of tables and chairs.For my dinner entrée I decided to have something a little different than my normal selections and went with the chicken and broccoli in a black pepper sauce.  Whenever the dish came out it looked exactly as I would have expected with some broccoli and chicken in a dark brown sauce that had visible pepper in it and side of rice.  The sauce was good but not nearly as spicy as I was expecting based upon the little chili pepper that was next to it on the menu.  It paired well with the chicken and broccoli and I ended up thoroughly enjoying my meal.  I especially enjoyed that my broccoli was cooked just right and was crispy instead of being overcooked and mushy.  My girlfriend also enjoyed her meal which was the eggplant in garlic sauce.  Her eggplant was also cooked nicely and the sauce was very similar to the one that I had except instead of the pepper it seemed to have a nice garlic flavor.  Before we left I also ordered a Large Green Lemon Bubble tea which I enjoyed on the way home.  They always seem to make it perfectly with a not too sweet flavor that goes well with the citrus and ample amounts of tapioca pearls at the bottom which get you through the entire drink.The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future.  With how good my food tasted I can see myself coming here more often and not just because I love the bubble tea.I've been to Rose Tea several times in the last three years, tried a variety of the food on the menu, but I've never been a huge fan. Came back here again last night because the boyfriend sprained his toe so we are eating whatever he wants to eat. After giving Rose Tea another chance, I'll admit I'm glad I did. It's a small, busy Taiwanese restaurant. We went for dinner on a Sunday night at 6:30pm and had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. Ordered the deep fried salt & pepper squid (a bit too salty, but still good that we ate most of it) and the short ribs w eggplant (very good, although I didn't try the eggplant). He got the lychee green tea (which he loved but I thought was too sweet) and I got the black milk tea w wheat germ (which I loved but he thought was just good, not great). Portions are great; these two dishes were more than enough for two people. The lady who took our order was friendly and adorable. She tried to squeeze behind me a couple times during the meal and joked in Mandarin that she needed to lose weight (she doesn't!). This was probably my best experience here in terms of food. Their bubble teas have always been good. Given my precious experiences here, I'm not sure if I would give it an overall rating of 3 or 4; 3.5 seems about right. This experience alone though was probably a 4. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 3.5OVERALL | 3.5

I am not really a big fan of pizza, even less so of mediocre ones. Right now my stomach is unhappy with me over my impulse choice for lunch.  The peperoni pizza I got was lukewarm, greasy and chewy.  Flavor wasn't too bad.There is no inside seating, the one time one of my employees went over to get lunch for the crew she had to wait outside.  So it is take out or delivery only.  They (crew) did say they thought the subs were better than the pizza and both of them like pizza.So how did I end up consuming a 12" pizza for lunch?  Every so often in the late morning one of their drivers comes through the complex offering pizzas for $6.00 (used to be $5).  That really is a pretty good price for a delivered one topping pizza.  Selling door to door like that I didn't even think about a tip and after eating the pizza I didn't feel bad about it.  You do have to admit it is a pretty good marketing scheme to hit up industrial areas just before lunch.  I think he only starts with 10-12 pies so they cannot get too cold before he is done.  I usually pass and will for quite a while yet now.

We always drove by this place and noticed it's filled with a decent amount of people. We decided to come check them out since most places were closed on Thanksgiving, but bars will be open even if the effing Rapture comes.So I was feeling a beer, but there wasn't much selection (at least for a craft person like me). Grabbed ice teas and we shared a "tall" (24oz, $5) of NewCastle. This place has some really cheap pitchers (I believe they range from $5-9 bucks during game times/happy hour)  so it's a good spot if you like whats on draft (Bud, Bud Light, Miler, Coors, Newcastle, Fat Tire, Pyramid Hefe). We got some appetizers:Fried Mushrooms ($6.99)- these were quite nice. The batter was nicely seasoned and stayed very crunchy despite it holding a watery vegetable. I really like fried mushrooms but most places don't have a batter that holds up. Artichoke&Spinach dip ($6.99)- pretty standard, but done right. Melty, creamy goodness. I appreciate that the chips were warm. Dinners:I grabbed the Red Rock chicken sandwich (grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce and melted swiss cheese- $8.49) and got it with a side of potato salad. The sandwich was juicy and had a good crispy char. It was rather tall once the lettuce, onions, pickles and top bun come into play so it's a fork and knife kinda situation. The potato salad is the usual mustard mayo base and what I would describe best as a "family picnic style" w/ some shredded carrot, black olive, hardboiled egg, and a bit of macaroni. The BF got a turkey club ($7.99) with spicy fries. The key with a club is crispy grilled bread (both sides), crispy bacon, quality turkey slices and fresh veggies in a proper ratio and you're golden. The spicy fries are not spicy, but more "spice-y" with a good layer of seasoning. Yeah, we had a bit of room for dessert and grabbed a Xango (Deep fried banana caramel cheesecake wrapped in a pastry crust rolled in cinnamon sugar, topped with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar and whipped cream, $4.29) This was okay. Posed a bit of problem with the filling gushing out, but the flavors were decent. FYI- I posted pics and prices to help out, there is a usmenuguide for this place, but it is outdated. Originally we dropped by a few days ago and while we were perusing the menu, the GM said they can't serve food because of a grease fire occurred a few hours earlier and it'll be a while. He apologized since he blanked out on it, gave us his card and invited us back to give them a try. He was so nice so we definitely made it a point to come back in. He did give us a discount for our meal, but definitely it was some solid bar food. I'm slowly starting to appreciate American food...haven't before and it's little quiet bars that are changing my mind about it. The only place for me that it lacks on is beer selection. I go to Big Dogs down the street if I'm feeling beer, but their menu at night is stripped down. If I feel bar food variety- I will head here.

After an unsuccessful Yelper excursion attempt to Pike's for late night desserts, I decided to stop by for lunch today instead. The atmosphere is interesting. It's casual and quaint, but set in a somewhat industrial styled brick building. Picture old wooden booths with coat hooks and large gilded mirrors set against a ceiling of exposed air ducts and dropped track lighting. We were greeted warmly at the door, guided to our table quickly and our orders were taken promptly. Their menu selection features traditional American favorites, some with Southern twists. Choose your own fixin's style burgers, meatloaf sandwiches, chicken tenders are just some of the selections. Their "made from scratch" soups caught my eye, but today's selection was potato bacon and sounded a little too heavy for my tastes. Our food was delivered within a reasonable time frame. My cheeseburger was good, somewhere between the mark of Five Guys and Penguin's. Fries were crisp, without the taste of old frying oil (my pet peeve). My husband's turkey burger was pretty tasty, seasoned with plenty of flavored seasoning salt. We finished lunch with the Tollhouse Pie, a chocolate chip cookie baked in a pie crust, topped with vanilla ice cream and fudge. It tasted just as I hoped. Warm, chocolaty, rich, but balanced by the ice cream - an American classic. My one criticism would be the restrooms which are in dire need of remodeling. I shudder if the old adage of judging a restaurant by their bathroom is really true. At any rate, the dining room atmosphere, food and dessert were all enjoyable.My family of 3 and I arrived today at Pike's for Sunday Brunch.  Upon arrival the 3 hosts informed us without a smile, eye contact, or any grace at all that the wait would be 15 minutes.  Another family arrived right after us and asked to be seated on the patio which was empty. While we waited beyond 30 minutes, 20 more people arrived all if whom were asked also to wait.  When it began to sprinkle outside I decided to look inside the restaurant. I was dismayed to see 6 open and cleared tables awaiting paying customers.  The wait staff were not working with any urgency at all and the 3 hostesses were certainly not at all interested in service.  My family and I left shortly after another family. Strictly from a business perspective why would Pike's pay 3 hosts to treat customers so poorly?  Alienating customers can easily be achieved by paying 1 host.  When I called and asked to speak to management I was told they were too busy to speak to me.  Pike's food does not warrant enduring such treatment. Pike's is not distinctively better than other choices in Charlotte. There is no reason to return and my family and I will not.Was just told by the manager that "walk-ins" were a higher priority over our reservation for 12 that was called in well in advance and then confirmed the night before.  We went to Big Ben's across the street. They served us immediately.  Going to Pike's to celebrate birthdays was my suggestion. A mistake I won't make again.

Overrated.  No, make that vastly overrated.There, I feel better, I needed to get that off my chest.When Glass Nickel Pizza burst on to the scene in the late '90s, they mopped the floor against weak-ass competition like Domino's, Pizza Pit and Rocky Rococo with their innovative topping combinations and fresh ingredients.  However, as local pizza market has evolved (enter Pizza Brutta, Salvatore's, Café Porta Alba, Grampa's, etc.), GNP was content to rest on their laurels.  Now it's GNP getting their butt handed to them by the new breed of pizzerias.  So word to the wise, ignore those "Best of Madison" accolades, they are based on past reputation and not current performance.The problems with GNP start with the crust - dense and largely flavorless, it overwhelms the other components of the pizza.  It's all chew and no crunch.  It also tends to be soggy in the middle, especially when you order vegetable or soft cheese toppings (yeah Fetalicious, I'm talking about you).  The tomato sauce is OK, not as bright as I would like and at times, a little too sweet.  Their pies could use more sauce to balance out all that bland crust.The quality of the cheese is a step below Madison's top tier pizza joints and a step above the Pizza Huts of the world.  Topping quantity varies from order to order. Sometimes GNP generously applies the toppings, while other times Scrooge McDuck seems to be in charge of the topping dispensing operation.If you handed me a slice of Glass Nickel Pizza, I'd certainly eat it, but it's not a destination for a great slice of pizza anymore.

Shoutout to Lisa L and Eric R for dragging my husband and I to this place (and bringing a killer coupon no less). I had always been scared of this place due to all the vegetarian verbage that gets thrown around. Luckily their meat dishes are outstanding as well! Lisa L's description of the food was spot on. Everthing was quite tasty. Service was pretty spotty, but no major complaints there. Beer was reasonable and varied ($4 for chinese/thai imports, $3.50 for American beers) and overall the dinner was an insane value. With the coupon we spent $12.50 each for our 4 course meal + dessert + drinks. Without the coupon we still would have spent a meager $18.50 (with tax and tip!) each for that feast. Killer. Now for a little comparison amongst Komol and LOS for the die hard foodies who can't decide which to go to (Pin Kao doesn't come close to measuring up to either one!). Got Vegan/Veggie people with you? Definitely Komol, no questionValue oriented? KomolLooking to eat the basics (ie curry, pad see ew, etc): KomolSo why should anyone ever go to LOS? LOS is really for a more sophisticated palate. The food is infinitely more interesting ! The drunken seabass noodles (not found at Komol) and the soft shell prawns (not found at Komol) are my two favorites. Komol was great, but comparing LOS and Komol is kind of ridiculous. It's like comparing Mon Ami Gabi to Joel Robuchon. Both are French, but the food is just so completely different. Honestly it just depends if you're looking to try Thai like you've never had it, or are you looking for the basics done well at a great price. Komol serves the later.In a large yet hidden plaza rests Komol, a quaint Thai eatery with great lunch specials.  The interior is cozy, and covered in very pretty purple fake flowers.  The paintings on the walls and other knick-knacks all show a lot of Thai pride, and are set up quite well as to not clutter your dining experience.I came in with a friend for lunch on a Monday for the lunch specials.  There are many options, and all come with an egg roll, and a soup or salad.  Go with the salad, since the peanut sauce is AMAZING.  Just the right amount of sugar and salt.  The vegetable soup was bland and forgettable.   I ordered the Panang Curry with tofu, my friend got the Indian curry with chicken.  I asked for the Panang extremely spicy, but it came out mild.  The curry was a little chalky, and needed to be cooked a bit longer or needed more water.  The Indian curry was spicy and tasty.  The menu is very large, and I would come back to try a few more items, even though the ones I had were nothing special.  The biggest short coming of this place is the time it takes for your food to get to the table.  It wasn't busy at all, and we still waited a good twenty minutes after our soup/salad arrived.Lotus of Siam has nothing on Komol!!!! There I said it. I love Komol. It's clean and the food here has never let me down. I have been a fan for twenty years now. It is in my top 5 of favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas without a doubt. I've tried most of their chicken and veggie dishes, but the Panang Chicken is my shining star here. The consistency of the curry sauce is excellent. Generally smooth and not watery. The heat level of the sauce is also to my liking along with the balance of the meat to veggie ratio.  My only gripe is the dark meat. Ugh. Although it's more flavorful I try to eat healthier and Komol will not let me order all white meat. What's up with that? The food here is 5 stars without a doubt, but the service is about a 2 star for me. The young boys working seem to be more into internet porn than making sure I get my Thai Tea I ordered fifteen minutes ago. They are friendly when they do decide to shuffle on over to the table, but don't expect them to remove your dirty plates when you are done or get your check in a timely manner. Remember, internet porn comes first, customers second. As far as takeout goes they handle that shit! I highly recommend Komol if you are looking for authentic Thai on the east side of town.I can't stop the accolades that I give Komol. When my family comes into town, the only restaurant everyone wants to go to is Komol. No Michelin stars, no Food Network stars....just Komol. The food here is so dependable and we are all such regulars that the staff is almost like family. Deliciousness here includes:Tom Kha - the coconut milk-based broth is so rich and flavorful. You can customize the veggies/protein you want added. I like it simple with lots of broth, broccoli, cabbage and straw mushrooms. It's comfort in a bowlFried Corn - Corn and batter shaped into patties and served with a sweet sauce. Crispy. smooth and delicious. I can't put the experience of eating this dish into words!Papaya Salad - The papaya salad here is seriously kick-ass. It's got the right balance of sweetness and tartness and it complements the Thai meal beautifullyPad Thai - The Pad Thai here with fried tofu is a tad on the sweet side but I actually like it that way. The noodles are perfectly cooked and mushed together with fresh sprouts, crushed peanuts and the Pad Thai gravy to create an explosion in your mouthGinger Tofu - Slivered ginger, soft tofu (we ask for soft and not fried), vegetables all tossed in a light black sauce served with crispy Jasmine rice. Oh-so-good for you in all ways!Panang Curry - The Panang here has a huge following. The curry is extremely rich with the freshly ground spices spewing out of each spoonful. Eating the gravy with rice is an experience to be hadGarlic/Pineapple Fried Rice - Garlic for the spice and savory lover and Pineapple for the sweeter savory dish lover. Both dishes are excellent and really culminate an Asian meal.Komol is really the place for every lifestyle. With a plant-based menu as well as a meat-based menu you can count on anyone who has a tastebud to be in culinary heaven. Again, Komol is is one of the top 5 reasons for me staying in Las Vegas!This is an ABSOLUTE must go to if you are vegetarian.  It was just the drive from the southwest that prevented me from coming here sooner.  What a menu!  So many great sounding choices.  It was hard to narrow entrees down but it had already been decided pre-arrival that the herbal salad was a must order appetizer.  Thanks Lisa R for the raving about it.  What a tasty, crazy mix of stuff.  The #7 spice was a little over the top as it set my tongue ablaze but was a good burn for the wife.  I don't know what happened to my relationship with spicy food but it has cooled off considerably the last few years.  I guess I'm getting old.  I would've ordered a 10 spice a long time ago. I was worried since we ordered our curries with #7 spice thinking I would need to ask for a fire extinguisher.  I asked the waiter if I could get a 4 or 5 for the Kang-Ped Delight I ordered.  He said "No problem" but the only problem was that the server had our curries right behind him!  Thankfully the coconut milk made it taste like a 5.The Kang-Ped Delight certainly was all that!  The curry had bamboo shoots, tofu, zucchini, baby corn, straw mushrooms, snow peas, carrots and hot peppers, cooked in red curry sauce with coconut milk.  It was probably the best Thai curry I've had in recent memory.  I added soy chicken for $2 and it made this killer.  The best fake chicken I've ever tasted.  How did they do it?  I can't wait to try their soy duck and shrimp on future visits.Komol, you no doubt deserve the bump up to FIVE STARS. I eat you at least once a week and have been coming here since I was 16. I've never been dissatisfied with the food. Not one bad dish in all that time. I cannot say that about any other restaurant. Also, the service has been stepped up a notch too, so thank you for that. Trust me, all the food is excellent here, but these are the dishes I always order:Tom KhaNum TokPanang BeefGarlic Pepper beef/chickenHerbal Salad- I dream about this FYI1. When you go to Komol if you say HOT they will make it HOT for you. Don't try to wear the Daddy pants if you don't have a belt if ya' know what I mean.2.  Even though the service has been much better recently I still recommend letting your server know if you are on a tight time schedule. They will do their best to accommodate you.Thank you Komol for the 20 years of flavorful dishes you have made for me and all of the memories I've made around your dinner tables.Komol has been on my radar for about a year and I finally stopped in Wednesday evening.  I knew from looking at the menu online that I wanted to try a duck dish.  I ordered the duck chili mint - boneless duck stir fried with garlic, hot peppers, and basil.  After reading the Yelp reviews of people I know, I opted for a spiciness level of 6 out of 10.  It turned out to be just about perfect considering the dish was spiced with red chilis and several slices of fresh jalapeño.  Tasty indeed but not overwhelming.For dessert, I ordered the pumpkin in coconut milk.  It was fresh pumpkin cubes in sweetened and warmed coconut milk.  Very good!Service was excellent.  When I asked the server about the size of a cup of soup, he told me it's generally too big for one person--people often split it--and I opted to skip having soup.  It was early and the restaurant was quiet, but everyone who works there was cheerful, greeted me, and had a big smile.Thanks for the tips, Misti, Mamie, Holly, and Paolo!I have to go back and try some more.  It is good!Thank you Yelp for helping me realize there were restaurants not called Lotus of Siam or Namaste in the Sahara Pavilion.   Thank you again for giving me the blueprint to ordering what I ultimately ordered from the giant encyclopedia set that apparently is the menu that they present to you at Komol.  "I don't see the herbal salad"   "Oh, check the Vegetarian section, page 23 on volume 2" We started with the Yelp heralded Herbal salad and got it brought to the table sort of as an appetizer.   One of my favorite new dishes of 2012 by far.  Yes, a dish consisting of fruits, veggies, tofu, cashews is one of the best new things I've eaten in the last 8 months.  This should be the moment I just bow out of the whole Yelping experience altogether.  DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY BEEF AND PORK DISHES I'VE EATEN DURING THIS TIME SPAN?   Okay, settling down.   So yeah, Herbal Salad: freaking amazing.  Next.   Vegetarian Pad Thai (Tofu).   Enjoyed the flavor on this, but it didn't really seem any different than other versions I've had.  Still worth ordering if you're a big fan of Pad Thai I guess, as I usually am not.   Then we had the Chili Mint Chicken, which I liked a lot.  Ground up chicken sauteed with garlic. hot peppers and basil.  Pretty standard fare for a thai restaurant, but done exceptionally well.  Lastly I had to try the much raved about Panang Curry with beef.   I was actually slightly disappointed in this considering due to reviews I was expecting angels to descend through the ceiling and bless my lips and tongue after each bite.  That being said, it was delicious even sans angels.  It had a smokier flavor than I'm used to having from pretty much any curry I've ever had.  I appreciated the large bowl of sticky rice they also provided the table which was great at soaking up the curry and whatever other juices or bits and pieces the other dishes left on the plate.  The only item I didn't enjoy was the non-dairy coconut ice cream I ordered at the end.  I didn't really expect it to be good because let's be honest, non-dairy ice cream just by principle isn't right.   The flavor was okay on it but texture-wise I wasn't a fan.   Little chunks of coconut were present and the overall texture was almost grainy, not smooth.   With so many amazing entree plates preceding it, I didn't really mind this mild disappointment.This hole-in-wall spot gets five stars from me because they're tasty, affordable, and  give you a hefty portion of food for a great price. Mainly, I'm talking about their lunch menu. Not only is your main course gargantuas but you get soup and an egg roll too! Hellz yes!  I'm that easy to be won over but the added bonuses aren't all that I love from this place. Comparing Kohmol's lunch menu to anywhere else, these guys provide you with a wide selection for vegetarians and the normal carnivore eater.  Service is some times slow but always genuine and friendly. I've had the pangang tofu and spicy eggplant dishes. Both were excellent and flavorful. As far as prices, deliciousness, and portions are concerned, this is the place that has me at lunch specials.I recently went on a date where the other person had some dietary restrictions. I was a little worried because I am a human garbage disposal. I eat everything. Sometimes you come across places that are vegetarian and it definitely feels like it is. As a person that enjoys meat, I did not miss it one bit when it came to Komol.The Vegetarian Platter: was a bountiful fest of lightly battered fried spinach, sweet potatoes, eggplant, and tofu. It reaffirms that you can fry anything and it would be amazing.The Chicken Noodle Soup: was just that. Nothing special, but it was welcomed on this cold day. No I am not talking about my experience on the date right now.The Herbal Salad: was everything everyone raves about and more. I loved the crispy fried tofu skins mixed in to give it more texture. The dish does not lack in that department or in flavor.The Vegetarian Delight Curry: was good. The eggplants, green beans, and tofu in a rich broth could have used more of a kick. We ordered it mild in case they actually went Asian hot on us. Instead it was definitely not made for someone who likes a kick.There was just so much food in the end. I am still in shock by the serving size here. The service was minimal, but since I was trying to get to know the person across from me, I was happy they only stopped by to drop my food and refill the waters.Arrived for dinner on a Sunday evening which is unusual for me BC I usually dine here during the week. I was shocked how busy they were - the dinning room was totally filled but I lucked out and secured the last booth before the waiting list began.I heart the vegetarian options Komol offers, although I'm not vegan. I chose a vegan combo dinner which was only $10.95 that included mushroom Tom Kha soup, spring roll and veggie pad Thai. The food was tasty and filling and can understand why Komol is doing so well!Komol will continue to be my go to place for Thai food in Las Vegas.Chili Mint Chicken - medium heat, a side salad with ginger dressing and an egg roll, and if I'm having a stressful day a glass of Chai Tea. While Thai food gives one ample opportunities to try something new, sometimes you just want comfort food. When that's what I need my car finds it's way to Komol for lunch, and for over a year now I get the comfort food I crave. Now once in a while they have an off day and I grumble about it, but a return trip always ends up with things going right again. I quickly realize how lucky I am to know of this wonderful place in the shadow of their overrated and over priced competitor that's right across the parking lot. You can't go wrong eating at Komol. It's family run, they take care of their customers, and the food is consistently great. (I just realized as I was writing this that my first visit to Komol was 6/20/2012...and since that time I've been there at least 30 times. My feet and my debit card keep coming back...really what other endorsement speaks louder than repeat patronage!). Back to 5 Stars. Seriously...they've earned it. (Plus if Jessie B or Jaime W. recommend it, it's always good...this was a Jessie B. recommendation that I'm so glad I listened to!)It is with a heavy heart that I downgrade my beloved Komol.  I loved the place so much that I had been looking past all the slip-ups the last few months, but I finally decided enough was enough.  If I had the same experience the first time I visited, I would have never come back.Since at least December, things have been falling apart.  Many times the food quality just wasn't there; the herbal salad was missing all the flavor it used to have or the tofu was fried into something unrecognizable.  Orders were put in wrong.  And every single time the service was just non-existent.  The servers are still friendly enough, but there were times we waited well over 40 minutes for our food to come out or 15 minutes for a check.  Once we were in the restaurant for two hours just trying to have a simple, quick dinner.And please, let's just put it out there: the place is in need of a good scrubbing.I still love you, Komol, but you need some time to work on you.After hearing so much hype about this place, I eventually made my way to Sahara and Commercial to finally give it a try.  On my first visit we ordered drunken noodles (pad kee mao) with chicken to go. She told us 15 minutes, but it was closer to 30 and the restaurant was empty. The chicken was minced/ground which was a bit unusual from what I am used to. The flavor was fine and the ingredients were quality, but it was not amazing nor did it warrant rushing back there. I decided I would try this place again before I wrote a review. A week or so ago, I went back because I was in the field and was in the nearby area. I met another friend for lunch and we gave their lunch special a try. I had their panang curry lunch special that came with an eggroll, rice and a soup of the day for $7.95. The soup was pretty bland with vegetable and tofu. The curry was fine, but not unlike Panang curry I have tried at plenty of other Thai joints. I had spicy 7/10 and I'd say to me more realistically it was like a 5/10. The service was very spotty and inconsistent. You can tell the wait staff started to get overwhelmed when the lunch rush hour began. But to be fair, they were pretty slow when it was just two tables in the joint.. The restaurant appears clean with interesting traditional Thai decor. The menu's have wooden covers which is a cool touch. I would probably try this place again if in the area and craving Thai, but I wouldn't drive here from home. This is a perfect example of a place being hyped up.WHO: The hungry people craving delicious Thai food!! They are Vegetarian friendly as well, so don't be SKURRED!!WHEN: Monday through Saturday, 11am-10pm; Sunday, 12pm-10pmWHERE: It is located in the Korean plaza on Sahara & Commercial.WHAT: I have been to this restaurant about 3 plus times and they never fail to make me a happy customer. Happy customers = favorites = telling other fellow yelpers = Komol has more favorites to serve! Lol.Whenever I come in, I am always delightfully greeted at the door, and then shown to my seat. One of my favorite things is the WOODEN MENUS. Too cute!... Inside these wooden menus, are delicious foods you may choose from: (the ones I've tried are as follows).1. Herbal Salad: my favorite salad in the entire GALAXY! This salad is definitely out of this world. I do not know what they do to it, but they are definitely DOING IT RIGHT!! This is a must have as soon as you are seated!2. Panang Curry: This dish is one of my favorites at every singly Thai restaurant, but their panang curry has got me hooked! I don't know how else to explain it, but it's just the blending of the spices, plus chicken or tofu = mm mm GREAT!3. Green Curry: As you can tell, I am a sucker for Thai curry! It is just absolutely TASTY! This also will have you asking for a second order!I am definitely going back for more as soon as possible. Get your car keys, hop in that car of yours, and head to Komol now! (Herbal Salad is a must! ;) ) HURRYYYY!!A strong 4 stars!...and the best Thai restaurant in Commercial Center! I met a delightful Yelper here for dinner.  We took Nelson Q's advice on going with the Herbal Salad to start.  This was crisp, fresh and different (the good/refreshing different, not the searching for a modifier different.)  We were fans of the Salad, the lemongrass, fresh herbs and fried tofu.   Spice level was 5/10 and played nice with the acidity of the salad.  My point?...you should order this salad.We also ordered Pork Pad Kee Mao and Veggie Panang Curry--wish I had read Cathy C's review that you can ask for items a little hotter here than you might at other Thai Restaurants.  The curry was a little thicker than usual...nice texture, felt a little love put into it...anytime you feel a little of the love that goes in to something that's good right?...yeah, it is!  The Pad Kee Mao was a little less flavorful than the other items, but this was the only dish we ordered mild...don't be like us...get them all at or near your maximum heat level!...added some chili flake and pepper sauce afterwards and was much better--not just heat wise, but for another level of flavor.  They do a great job here with their Pad Thai as well.The restaurant itself is rather nice inside.  You can easily forget that you are in commercial center.  We also appreciated the signs on restrooms.  A heart of the lades chest (assuming because women love with their hearts) and a heart over the males gentiles (assuming because men love with their...,) nice and direct?...I liked it.I have long since stopped trying to find the best Thai in Vegas.  There is a different favorite for each Thai dish that I typically get.  I would definitely come before I would go to any hyper popular Thai spot in the same center!  Additionally though Komol has earned a spot with me for their Herbal Salad.Inconsistent service seems to be what Komol is serving up lately. At the time I write this I'm currently holding the Duke status on the Yelp app from all my check-ins. And I've been a fan of Komol for almost 2 years now. Service over that time has seen some rough spots but my visit today was a first: I walked out without having been served the main part of my order. A little backstory... While Komol has an extensive menu with great offerings like their curries and vegetarian fare it's the Chili Mint Chicken that's my comfort food of choice. I've ordered it so much that most of the staff knows my order...they don't even have to hand me a menu. So yes I know Komol, and when they are on their game they totally blow away their competition across the parking lot. But then you get days like today where you ask for an extra egg roll and never get it. Or it takes them 35+ minutes to attempt to put out a simple plate of Chili Mint Chicken that can normally be done in under half the time. I understand the place gets busy or they have called in orders. But I've been there when the place was even busier and didn't see the delay I had today. And what makes it even more frustrating is my last visit was perfect in almost every way. But the visit before that was almost as bad as today...and this is all in the past 2 weeks. Thankfully there is a McDonalds down the street so a quick unhealthy Big Mac, fries, and a sweet tea kept me from going back to work hungry. But now that I no longer have an empty stomach I wonder how can I get a message across to the Komol staff that their service needs to improve? The only option I have is to drop some stars...and express my frustration where it will get noticed and hopefully acted upon. Come on Komol....fix this mess. Until they make some changes...yeah, Eek! Me thinks not, one star territory seems appropriate. It's harsh...but then again I didn't feel so hot leaving hungry either.5 stars for the food! 3 stars for everything else.. This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!I had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.When we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously. Food wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that. The spice level that we asked for in each dish was exactly on point, something that has never happened to me except at LoS. That says a lot.Herbal Salad - believe the hype, for it is real. This is a *must order* item! I don't know if this their signature dish, but it should be. It's a very unassuming plate.. but aren't a lot of great dishes the same way? After taking in that first spoon, it was love at first bite. The textures were amazing. Apples, crunchy tofu, lemongrass, and much, much more. I'll leave it to you guys who've never tried it, to experience it for yourselves. You won't regret it.Drunken noodles - they killed it here as well. I was mystified how they were able to add all that flavor into each rice noodle. It's pretty crazy. It was as if the sauce and spices were made into the noodles. A stunner!Mango sticky rice - the mango was perfectly ripe, and tasted how a real mango should taste like. The sticky rice was sticky-icky! It also wasn't cloyingly sweet, and complimented the mango brilliantly. Another winner!The panang curry and tom yum soup were excellent and items that I would highly recommend!But, like in many operations, service kind of destroyed a great meal. Our server was gracious, kind, and helpful. But asking two servers to run a full restaurant, taking orders, running their food, and bussing their tables is just asinine. I know that the business is trying to cut costs, but as the great Chris Carter says "C'mon, man!"Service aside, I would happily come back here because the food is that good. I shall see you on that flip side!Komol used to be one of my personal Best of Las Vegas favorites...and a weekly lunch stop for me. But that changed when I've sat there for lunch and spent 45 minutes waiting for food that never arrived and I ended up walking out more than once. Their Chili Mint Chicken is good, the Panang Curry...is wonderful. And to be honest they totally blow away the overhyped Northern Thai place right across the parking lot with 4x the number of Yelp reviews. But I'm not coming back to Komol for awhile. I hope the ownership of Komol can take some time to work on handling large groups. Yes, having several tables full of Zappos people is good for business. But when you can't find the time to bring one glass of Thai tea, an eggroll, and a plate of Panang Curry out to one of your regulars...you've got some problems. The place could use some spiffing up too, and they've been playing the same piped in music so long I can tell when the music is going to start over again. 1 Star. I don't want special service, just take my order and bring me my food and don't make me late getting back to work. I don't think that's asking too much.

Did somebody say meat? Argentina...the home of Messi and great steaks with chimichurri, how can I resist Rincon De BA?Located along Spring Mountain somewhere in Chinatown, you'll find this unassuming place.  It's in the same complex as Cafe de Japon and Cathay House.  They have a few tables and there was only 1 server when we went here - he did try his best to provide good service to all the diners so I can't fault him for that.We were given a basket of bread with an amazing cup of chimuchurri on the side.  That's it, end of review!  But wait, I still have to share the other fantastic parts of the meal.  We had the empanadas (a beef, a chicken and a spinach) which were yummy.  I liked the chicken empanada the most.  The crust wasn't as crisp as the Spanish empanadas I'm used to but the filling was great.  We also got the parrillada Martin Fierro (short ribs, filet mignon, skirt steak and flap meat) with a side of papas fritas de provenzal (garlic fries).  The meats were so tender, juicy and packed with flavor then dip it in chimichurri?  Oh my goodness!  Intense tastebud experience!  The papas fritas were warm, crisp and garlicky.For dessert I finished a mixto flan by myself.  The syrupy flan kind of looks strange but it's good.  It came with a side of crema chantilli and dulce de leche.  Eating the flan wih the dulce de leche was divine!This Real Madrid fan gives Rincon De Buenos Aires 5 stars (even though Messi's our rival)!I have driven by Rincon countless times and was amused by the name in big letters and below a small sign saying Italian deli.  It didn't seem to go together, but I get it now.  They have more than just Argentinian food but that's the highlight.  It's the corner storefront of this U shaped shopping plaza in Chinatown, hence the name.I came here with a friend for a late morning lunch and we ordered and shared many items from the menu.  We were brought some bread and chimichurri.  The spices in the chimichurri were very good and went well on the bread and some meat we had later on.We started with an order of provoletta--grilled provolone cheese topped with chili and the chimichurri spices.  We took our knives and dug in and pulled up some cheese that hung like melted cheese will.  I put the cheese on my bread.  Vary tasty and great start.  We then got the order of three empanadas--one ham and cheese, one chicken, and one corn and cheese.  All three were good.  I liked the chicken the most.  The crust was flaky and thin.  The amount of filling for the three was perfect.Then came the main course--a Parrillada Argentina, a mixture of grilled meat.  Ours consisted of three sausages, sweet bread, skirt steak, and short ribs.  It was perfect for sharing.  We each had a length of short rib, one white sausage each, we shared the one black sausage (blood sausage or blood pudding are two names for it) and we each had a skirt steak.  We got all the meat cooked medium.  The skirt steak was a little tough but it was tasty.  The chimichurri added to the meat.  The grilled meats were really very good.  My favorite here was the blood sausage.  It's the first time I've had it and it was quite good.Then we ordered four desserts to share--dulce de leche flan, an alfajor, a Mil Hojas, and a pasta frola.  While all four were excellent, I had two favorites here--the mil hojas and the alfajor.  I'd had an alfajor once before and it was good to have this sweet cookie once again and the mil hojas had a great filling of chocolate and the spice, which we couldn't quite place was cardamon our server told us.  The flan was very soft and the pasta frola--quince tart--was also quite good.  Service was great!  Our server was a delightful young woman who answered questions and always had a pleasant smile.  She refilled our water glasses several times.A great meal with a good friend--that's what Saturdays are for--or any other day of the week ending in y.

Review Text :
Exploring the city's German fare, the BF and I headed over to Cafe Heidelberg the past Friday evening.  Upon entering, the waitress looked at us and then the clock.  I asked if they were closing and she said no, but we had five minutes to order.  (I guess the last seating is definitely at 8 pm.)Walking past the small market and into the back, we seated ourselves into a quaint little booth.  A bunch of older folks filled the other tables and you get the feeling that this is definitely a family kind of place.  (Hofbrauhaus and Cafe Heidelberg are in two totally different leagues.)The waitress handed us the menus and a beverage list.  The food menu is very basic, nothing fancy at all.  And the beverage list has a decent variety of beers and wine.  I wanted spatzle, and that's all I cared about.  So I ordered one of the few things that came with spatzle - the Jagerschnitzel ($23), "Pork schnitzel lightly battered and smothered in a mushroom , wine and onion sauce.  Paired with red cabbage and spatzel."The BF was torn between the Mixed Wurst Plate ($23), "Bratwurst, Knackwurst, and Bockwurst.  Served on a bed of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes," and the Oktoberfest Platter ($25), "A classic pork schnitzel and a jumbo Bratwurst paired perfectly with red cabbage and homemade spatzle."  He chose the former since I already had the pork schnitzel and spatzle in my dish.As we waited for our entrees, bread and butter arrived with our beverages.  We also took a little walk through the market to check out their German groceries and deli.  A limited choice of food items, but you'll find your herring, spatzel, and sauerkraut available here for home.My pork schnitzel was covered with dark brown gravy and was quite tender.  Pretty good.  The spatzel was okay, but maybe it's because I prefer it with a creamier sauce instead, like mushroom.  (I think I should have ordered the Kase Spatzle ($16), "House recipe German noodles smothered with melted Swiss cheese.  Garnished with tomatoes," instead.)  The red cabbage was blah, nothing special but the side salad was pretty tasty.  The BF's wurst feast came with a side of mustard sauce for dipping and a huge helping of sauerkraut.  The different wursts were pretty good and the sauerkraut was okay.  (Then again, I think I'm a fan of it on the colder end and crunchy than soggy.)They were both very generous orders and we had leftovers to go.  We never made it to dessert which was "Bavarian Apple Strudel with vanilla sauce" ($7) and "Black Forest Cherry Cake" ($5).  Overall, Cafe Heidelberg may probably be more authentic German fare than Hofbrauhaus.  They were recently voted "Best of Las Vegas" for "Other Ethnic Restaurant" again.  So, if you want your German fix, head on over to Cafe Heidelberg, just don't expect the loud music, crazy games, and the long wait of its competitor.(I added pics of our dinner in the business profile!)

It's Denny's. It has food. It's really cheap if you order off the $2/$4/$6 menu.I wouldn't recommend it, although the service was fine, but then again, getting eight people to agree on anything that early when they're hungover leads to some Denny's  type experiences.So go, just know it'll be just like the last time you went to Denny's.This is my favorite place to go when I want a home cooked meal. Been going here my whole life, and I'll say it's my favorite place for comfort food.The chef never disappoints, he's on par!Thank you so much!

When Rick Sebak says it's a good place to go, you go! So I went, and while the food may not have blown me away, the pies are totally worth the drive here!You can totally tell this is a spot that sees repeat costumers day in and out. We had an early dinner at 5pm and it was packed with families and couples. The decor reminds you of a ski chalet, it's quite cozy. All you needed is a roaring fireplace!We read the reviews about the battered shrimp, so we started off with that as an app. They were very good, and I believe that breadcrumb family recipe is legit. Plus, the cocktail sauce was surprisingly good. But the main dishes we split, between the rainbow trout, almondine cod and seafood platter were a little bland. The real treat is the pies, as I stated earlier. Most are cream pies, offering their famous coconut cream pie, but also banana cream, chocolate cream and an apple pie, among other choices... I kinda zoned out after my excitement set in for the coconut pie. It was light and fluffy and delicious, just like you'd expect it to be. Toasted coconut flakes just topped it off. I hear the owner bakes a bunch of pies in the morning and you get what you get by the end of the day, so I was glad to enjoy the coconut one! While I probably wouldn't be back for dinner, I'd definitely be back for a slice of pie... or the whole pie!

My breakfast literally had to be served on three separate plates.  For the second time in a row I got the breakfast scrambler. I doubled checked with the waitress, "Do you get pancakes and French toast with the scrambler?" To which she replied ,"Yes."  I can hardly believe you get two eggs, home fires bacon or sausage, pancakes and French toast for $7.99.It's been so long since I have ordered a meal where the difference between cost of raw materials/ingredients and cost of meal were so small.  This happened one other place recently and that would Sushi Fuku in Oakland.Eating this terrific cheap breakfast came the morning after eating an $18.00 buffalo chicken macaroni from Six Penn.  I'm still a little ashamed of that.Lindos Restaurant filled both my heart and my tummy.

I have driven by Hinson's numerous times, it has a fluorescent hot dog in the window and it's beside a cement building strip club that just reads: TOPLESS. Always catches my eye.I remember reading about Hinson's in last year's burger bracket. This week was the day I tried it!The chili and slaw is made in house, he had a bbq sandwich special the day, I was with one of my friends so we ordered a bbq sandwich, hot dog and a hamburger, I wanted to try EVERYTHING!!!  I ordered a jalapeno burger, he put pickled jalapenos on the grill before he placed them on the burger!  I watched him make all the food, he makes every sandwich with care.The hot dog won my vote, it was piping hot and I asked him to cook it well done, it was perfect.  My French fry barometer registered a sexy whistle because I thought I was at the strip club.  The French fries were so hot, you had to let them cool, even dipping them in ketchup didn't work.. hot, hot, hot!Phil, the only employee who was there told me they have karaoke on the first Friday of every month, dare I say?????  Let's go?On the list for off the beaten path, authentic, unique to Charlotte lunch stop..

I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to check it out.  Today I stopped for some lunch.  As I pulled up to the restaurant, I noticed the sign in front of the joint that said "2 Slices & Soda $5.95".....perfect!I asked the guy at the counter if the 2 Slice Special is more or less Pizza than a Personal 10" Pizza....he said the 2 Slice Special has more Pizza, so I went with it.  The special price is for Cheese only, to add more toppings it's $.50 ea, so I decided to add Pepperoni & Sausage to both slices.....total damage $6.95.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=Z2zzt8zXaQBX8doxb9-58gI then grabbed a Soda out of the beverage cooler, they have Coke Zero, score!  I'm not much of a Soda drinker, but there are 4 Sodas I have a tough time saying no to.....Mexican Coke or Pepsi, Pepsi Max, and Coke Zero.  I swear they put liquid Crack in Coke Zero!After a short wait, my Pizza was ready.  The Crust is slightly thicker than a NY Style Pizza and you must fold the Pizza if you want to eat it properly, otherwise you'll have to use a knife and a fork....which is a Sin!  I took one bite and thought the Pizza was really good.  The Pepperoni was great, quality stuff.  The Sausage was pretty good, but not great......was missing "something".  The Pizza had the perfect proportion of ingredients.....the Cheese or Sauce didn't overwhelm the Pizza.....which is a common mistake at some Pizza joints.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=wjkjIIETK87tO8549L0MaQOverall, I thought it was really good Pizza.  I was left wanting more.....I could have easily eaten another 2 Slices......next time I'm ordering a Medium for myself...ha!I noticed their sign that said their Wings were Baked, not Fried.....heard from Matt S that it's some of the best Wings in town.....have to try that next time!Return Factor - 90%I stopped by here for lunch and tried out their lunch special, 2 slices of cheese and a 20 ounce bottled soda for $5.95 including tax. There were 3 employees inside when I walked in who all greeted me and were very nice. They have tables inside and a TV. I sat at a table while my food was being prepared and it wasn't long before it was ready. I also asked for a "Cannoli" priced at $3.25 to be packed to-go and it was made fresh to order. The pizza was just so-so to me. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. The price was certainly right! The Cannoli was actually very good and one of the best I have had. Those alone are worth stopping by for.They offer delivery to a wide range of the valley.Cliffs Notes: I live in Summerlin, and this is by far the best pizza delivery option. My go to favorites are the Widowmaker and the BBQ chicken but I often split a onion/garlic/sausage/pepperoni with a friend at work for lunch. Full ReviewSo this place is obviously not Pizza Rock quality, but I don't think anyone could expect that from a residential delivery place. If you are a pizza snob this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a step up over Pizahut/Dominos kind of place than this is great. Some notes on the PizzaPrice wise this place is about 75-100% more expensive than your average delivery chain for just about everything- pizza, drinks, wings etc. A few reviews have raved about the "fresh ingrediants"- this is not exactly true. Their sauce comes out of a jar, I have never seen anyone slicing vegetables etc- they seem to use your run of the mill restaurant supply ingrediants. I wouldn't really expect anything different for the price but if you are a fresh food fenatic you may be dissapointed.Delivery times- I live 2 miles from the place, I work about 500 feet from it. Delivery takes about 45 minutes to an hour whereas pickup takes 20 minutes so I would highly suggest picking it up to avoid getting the pizza past its prime. Wings- I love chicken wings and these are perfectly passable delivery wings given that we have no dedicated wing joint in summerlin. They are baked not fried which does negate the crispness a little but not too much.Garlic knots- yes these are pretty good. You get 1-2 with your pizza depending on the size, would recommend getting a side order to avoid fights to the death in a situation of GK scarcity.

This place is so unique which is why I'm giving it 5 stars.  You do need a minimum number of people so make sure you call ahead to get the deets on that.  It's like being invited to a friend's house where they are making you a home cooked Hungarian meal!  I wasn't really sure what Hungarian food consisted of before making my way here but there's noodles, meat, cabbage and bread involved.  Oh the bread - it seriously came right out of the oven on to our table in to our mouths - it was PERFECT!  The place is BYOB and is very casual and cash only.  So make sure you bring some good company, bottles of wine and cash!  The owner is extremely sweet and will talk you through the dishes if you have questions.

Review Text :
My favorite part about Allegheny County isn't the big chain locations and fancy brand new spots (though I'll try anything once), but it's the places that give us our unique something from nothing flavor not found nowhere else and Lapko's, is one of those locations that lives up to that.If Cheers was still on the air this is what it would be like.  Original Tin ceiling, vintage memorabilia, old school charm looking to add in some new school style.  A pool table and to my surprise one of those table top bowling games (this is the place for some great Instagram pics).  I didn't eat but they serve food also, probably next time.  If 8th and the Water Front continue to dedicate itself to revitalization I believe this place could survive long through another era of A homestead boom.  I could kinda see Homestead creating its own SouthSide esque.If you are fresh in town, looking for somewhere new to add to your untapped account, or always stay here yet never been, I'd suggest giving this place a visit.

Review Text :
I was lucky enough to be able to check The Diamond out for their soft opening last night and from what I can tell they are geared up and ready to rock Plaza Midwood's socks off.The fried pickles and burgers are just as good as (if not better than) I remembered them from around the corner. Rest assured, all your old favorites are here. But the menu also has a lot of delicious newcomers. I opted to go with the meatball parm sub. The meatballs and sauce were both nicely seasoned and the cheese was melted to stringy deliciousness on the top. Don't expect a side of fries, but hey, there are enough delicious sides available to order (ex: crab dip, pig wings, fried pickles, etc.) that you won't miss the "plate" style combination.The inside has been redesigned in a way that can only be classified as kitschy-chic. Bright blue vinyl booths (though there aren't a whole ton of them so keep wait times in mind when if you go right after they open), oversized utencil art, and vintage wallpaper all await you inside The Diamond along side a lot of familiar faces.I want to see how they run with a full crowd and sink my teeth into some more of the sizable menu before I go tossing around a fifth star, but so far it looks like The Diamond is ready to knock it out of the park!There is some magic in the air about The Diamond, first of all the restaurant has been around Charlotte since 1945, it's kitchy and cozy.  The guys who took it over, polished it up without overdoing it or making it too cool for school.  It is packed tightly with tables, I don't remember it being so compact on my last visit, but it works.The powder, deep, robin's egg, Tiffany box.... blue vinyl booths give me a hard on.  I didn't know I was going to the Diamond on this sneak peek night, but Julia S. and the Mister texted me, so I headed over.  Since I wasn't hungry, I just ate a Winky Dinky dog and a shit ton of their french fries smoothered with pimento cheese and vegetarian gravy.  Jeez Louise.  I wonder what I would have consumed if I were hungry. Har, har, har.  Really, I don't even like gravy on my french fries and I could not stop eating.The Winky Dinky dog was served on a split top white bread bun, sent straight from white bread forbidden hell and it was delicious.  It really tasted like it was fried and finished on the grill, complete with the grill taste-   4th of July when you were a kid kinda taste, topped with chili and pimento cheese.  I added raw onion and yellow mustard and called it a day.I checked my Magic Eight Ball for the Diamond's future. Will The Diamond succeed?  It is decidedly so.Oh Diamond.  I have been waiting and waiting and waiting and, well you get the point.  The fried pickles are exactly the same as the Penguin's.  The burgers are dryer & crunchy on the outside, not as good as they used to be.  I really like the addition of the vegetables, I got mac & cheese which was good but lacked oomph & the sweet potato fries were tasty but kind of dry without something to dip them in.  I definitely want to come back (months from now when it's died down!) & try some of the greek food.  They were out of most of it when we went.  now, here is where my love for The Diamond stops.  I am not kidding when I say that it was the worst service i've ever had.  Our server was awful, it took ages to take our order & she got it wrong.  She was also sick (sneezing into her elbow, wiping her nose), pretty gross.  It took her 30 minutes after we were seated to take our order, our fried pickle appetizer took 45 minutes to appear (by then I was ready to chew my arm off!), my order was wrong & they forgot part of another order.  Cut to the end of the meal & we were informed that the internet was down & they couldn't take credit cards. We were told it would be a few minutes.  15 minutes pass, still can't pay, a new set of customers have already taken over our table and we're still waiting.  another 15-20 minutes pass and we still can't pay.  We had to send someone to the Common Market to get cash because the wait was getting ridiculous.  Our server informed us when we asked if they had any other way to take credit cards or if the manager would comp our meal for waiting 45 to pay told us we were being uncool.  They did eventually cut our bill in half.   I know The Penguin's thing was to have not so friendly waitresses, but at least they were unfriendly and efficient, she was just rude.  I really really wanted to love The Diamond, but I won't be going near it for a few months.  They have a lot of kinks to work out.There has been a whole lotta buzz about the Diamond in recent weeks, hasn't there? And no, I'm not going to hash out a review about their history and challenges that resulted in the final product...y'all can research that yourself. I'm here to talk about the food! And the service :)After waiting it out a few weeks, hubs and I finally rolled into the Diamond at 6:15 pm on a Monday night in hopes of avoiding an astronomical wait. And, cha-ching! No waiting. Our server Jason got to us pretty quickly and set us up in a booth with drinks within minutes. The interior of the Diamond is really great - shiny, vinyl booths, kitschy wallpaper, sweet sized bar near the back. I really dig the color scheme - the place looks wonderful.A couple things to note...they were out of many items. I realize they are still going through some kinks and, unfortunately, it shows. The menu is quite large and I can only imagine how tough it's been to gauge inventory with long lines and a hefty menu. Since a good deal of the pent up anxiety about the Diamond revolves around the food, here's what I indulged in & how it fared:Fried pickles: 3.5/5: Tasty slices of pickle-y love & a very generous portion - even for a half size. Yes, that's $3.95 for a boatload of fried pickles. These little babies came out piping hot with a side of ranch. My only gripe? The breading was pretty plain and the ranch was fairly thin. A little spice would kick this dish right up to 5 stars for me. My meal: I chose the quarter fried chicken plate, a steal with two sides and your choice of biscuit, cornbread or yeast roll. While I was yearnin' for some cornbread, they were out of it. *cries* Oh well, I went with a biscuit, green beans and a baked sweet potato. Fried chicken: 4.5/5: This rivals my grandma's fried chicken. Crispy, hot, perfectly seasoned with just a touch of grease. Hey - it's fried chicken...a little grease is good. The meat was juicy tender and freakin' delicious. Green beans: 1/5: I barely stuffed two beans in my mouth. These tasted straight out of the can with a pound of salt added. Serves me right for ordering a non-fried veg. Baked sweet potato: 4/5: Yes. It was a baked sweet potato! No butter required. Biscuit: 3/5: A good biscuit, not a great one. I have to admit that I compared this biscuit to Dish's and it just didn't quite measure up. Nevertheless, the Diamond swings a soft biscuit and it went well with the fried bird on my plate. I vacillated between 3 & 4 stars for the Diamond, but ultimately went with 4 stars because of the value you get from the food, the fun & vibrant ambiance and overall potential. I'll be back!Chill atmosphere, decent vegan options and moderate prices; why did it take me so long to visit?The Diamond has lots of local drama drama in how it came to be (and how The Penguin came to suck). For more reading! Look at others' reviews or google it.Now to focus on the place itself: comfy booths, dim lighting, and very popular to the alternative-sort of people without Charlotte. This place is one of the Must-Go's in Plaza Midwood.The food is as diner traditional as they can get (while still adding a modern flourish). I have the Jumbo Soy Dog which came with meatless chili, mustard, onions and coleslaw on it. I was pretty impressed and quite happy.Even though much of the menu is barred off to do due to my veganism and hatred of greasy food, I'll definitely be back!"Won't get fooled again!!!" I had been prior to the change, and now after---and this place still has a long way to go. If you're looking for Penguin 2.0, don't be fooled. The menu items are similar, the classic favorites are there (Big Bloc burgers, Pimento cheese, fried pickles, etc.), although I feel the attention to detail isn't quite taken as seriously. Sanitation score could use an upgrade as well....91.5? That's pretty borderline.I feel like they're still struggling to find their identity as well. Let the penguin be the penguin and keep their own menu, you guys should just do the blue plate thing, and do it better than anyone else; you're sort of half in-half out with both concepts. Also there were like 20 biker guys/gals out front when we came in (mind you it was around midnight) that were a little sketchy; they didn't really seem to be eating/drinking, more just loitering. I don't have anything against the bike crowd, but it caused the entrance to be a little awkward and uninviting. I might give it another shot, but this time wasn't that great, sorry guys.I've gone to the Diamond an many occasions, and it has always been spotty.  One visit terrible, one visit pretty good, but never great.  After my visit this past weekend, I guess I'm calling it quits.  The bottom line is that it's not worth going to a place when the odds are the service and food will sorely disappoint.  We had two people visiting from out of town, and forgot Dish was closed, so we figured "hey, the Diamond wasn't too bad last time, let's go there."  Luckily, there was no wait, the four of us sat down, asked what the specials were and it turned out they were out of the specials.  Two of us then ordered the black bean burger.  They were out of that too.  We got some other stuff, and a starter of fried pickles, which were okay.  My friend asked the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh, because she was thinking about a BLT.  The waiter seemed offended and gave a dismissive,  "yes."  Then we waited and waited for the food.  It took way too long to come out.We finally got our dishes.  I was okay with mine, but everyone else was very disappointed.  It was as if Diamond shops for the absolute bottom-rung ingredients.    If you put a salad on a menu, it should be at least somewhat appetizing.  The small block burger was a sad, ugly  thing.  The tomatoes were hard and without much flavor.  One person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as "disgusting."  I was embarrassed to have brought friends there.The take-away lesson here is that it's great to be a local institution.  It's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele.  But if you're a restaurant, it's still all about the food for most of your patrons.  You need to have quality food.  And don't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner.  Especially when you're charging $9 or more for some plates.  A lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price.So the Diamond is still a great place to get a drink, but they've got to overhaul nearly everything when it comes to their food.

Restaurant name  Sushi Q
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Sushi Q was suggested to me by a regular customer. She and I share similar tastes in food and would often see each other at our neighborhood sushi favorite, Hana. Always up for a new food experience, I went to Sushi Q with my partner tonight and was pleasantly surprised.It's one of those unassuming, stuck-in-a-strip-mall-in-an-odd-part-of-town places -- tucked away between a liquor store and baskin-robbins on 19th avenue, just south of dunlap. Inside is a somewhat typical looking sushi place, a little dated but with a nice enough wooden sushi bar and some cute japanese accents (geisha prints, sake bottles, row of cute fortune cat figures.)My partner had already arrived and was enjoying a couple items off the all-you-can-eat menu, so I decided to join him. I'm not much of an all-you-can eat person, but somehow it seems OK here - and a decent bargain at $25 per person. I'm happy to say that it was a smart decision as everything we had was really good to delicious. Not to mention a great way to sample items on the sushi menu. (AYCE menu is a bit more limited than regular sushi menu, but still offers a good variety of items)You'll find most of the usual suspects on the AYCE sushi menu, plus a variety of specialty rolls. Salmon and albacore nigiri, spicy tuna handroll and agadashi tofu were all very good (though agadashi was really just tempura tofu with dipping sauce). Red Snapper nigiri was outstanding -  fresh light fish with a citrus ponzu, green onion and bit of sriracha for just the right kick. Also really enjoyed the Hot Night roll - spicy tuna, crab and avocado deep fried and topped with spicy mayo, sriracha and sesame seeds - yum! what's not to like about that?There's also a small but decent selection of sake and beer here, and prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi spots in town. Our server and sushi chef were very nice and helpful, and I have a feeling that the more we come back, the more we'll feel like family. And I can tell you now, we'll be back many times...One night during my visit to Arizona, I was extremely hungry and craving sushi. Dining at traditional sushi restaurants was not an option ($$$$). I searched all over town for AYCE sushi and Sushi Q was the only restaurant that Yelp returned within Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, Phoenix, and Scottsdale. I jumped into my car and quickly roared out to Sushi Q at around 7:00pm. Sushi Q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. When I arrived during happy hour, there were only 3 people in the restaurant! There's no need to beat the dinner rush here. I sat at the bar and designated myself as an AYCE customer. After perusing the order menu, I was upset to discover an 8 order limit on the nigiri. 8 orders = 16 pieces. When I eat AYCE sushi in California, I typically average ~50 pieces, with a personal record of 64. Nobody cares how much you order in California, as long as you don't throw up on premises. Apparently not the case in stingy Arizona.The nigiri menu is sparse with limitations to the basic fish. Uni was not an option on the menu. Neither were any premium fish (not even off the AYCE menu). I ordered the standard choices: albacore, mackerel, red snapper, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallop, and yellowtail. The rice was served at room temperature as it should be. The fish quality of the tuna, salmon, and red snapper was acceptable, but the presentation for the other sushi was poor. Excessive ponzu sauce and green onions were applied on top of the yellowtail, mackerel, and albacore, to the point where I could not taste the distinct flavor of each fish. See photos for the sloppy preparation and the overuse of onions. The quality was disappointing even for a Korean sushi chef.For economic purposes, Sushi Q expects AYCE customers to fill up on appetizers and rolls rather than the fish. I feared leaving with a half full stomach, so I ordered rolls and appetizers after the nigiri. Rolls do not have order limits, but premium rolls were strategically removed from the AYCE menu. I asked for the negi salmon roll, yellowtail roll, and rainboll roll. The rolls were handled by a Hispanic sushi chef. The rainbow roll was standard, although the rice was a bit stiff. Yellowtail roll was a salty disaster, with excessive garlic/chili sauce drenched over the fish that spread to the rice. Fortunately, the negi salmon roll was acceptable with minimal sauces used and generous amount of salmon in each piece. Be aware that appetizers are full orders. I ordered agedashi tofu expecting just a few pieces of hot tofu. Instead, I received a basket full of fried tofu enough to feed a family of 3. The agedashi tofu was a joke. It was supposed to be served in a broth with Katsuobushi, Japanese onions, some rice wine, and soy sauce, but all that was given was a bowl of soy sauce separated from the tofu.In the end, I left with a full stomach but was dissatisfied with the quality of food consumed. I came to eat sushi but was instead instructed to order mediocre rolls engulfed in puddles of assorted sauces. The 16 piece limit is a severe limitation that renders the AYCE option as not cost-effective ($23.95 for dinner).

Neighborhood taverns and lodges make it an easy stop for a simple lunch break.It was quiet on a Wednesday as we were the only ones here for lunch.  The waitress came out and got our beverages going as we checked out the menu.I went for the Grilled Chicken & Avocado Sandwich "Marinated grilled chicken breast, fresh avocado, swiss cheese, apple wood bacon, red onion, tomato and sprouts.  Served with mayo, on a fresh baked roll." ($8.95)  My sandwich was surprisingly really good - the chicken was very flavorful and not dry at all.  It was definitely a score with my choice! The Husband went for their Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich "Tender tri-tip, lighted grilled then dipped in our slow cooked rosemary au jus, topped with swiss cheese and stuffed in a toasted hoagie roll." ($8.95)  Sadly, it was very disappointing for him, lacking flavor and the au jus definitely needed a little something to jazz it up.All sandwiches and wraps come with your choice of fries, onion rings, cole slaw or side salad.  We both chose the side salad and definitely appreciate that it's a generous side salad, not those things you get from Wendy's! Overall, I was really pleased and the Husband was not.  I guess it's a hit or miss here.  They still accept the Entertainment coupon here!

Restaurant name  Picasso's

Review Text :
Picasso's Pizza is my favorite pizza joint in the Madison area by virtue of their consistency and continuous quality.  There are plenty of places to get a great pizza in Madison and the surrounding area, but I find myself coming back to Picasso's time and time again.  A good part of this is the location.  Picasso's is located in an small strip mall off of Verona Road in Fitchburg.  Not exactly a chic location, but it happens to fall about halfway between my place and my best friends' in Fitchburg.  Another friend lives within walking distance.  It's the kind of place where we can all meet up, have a couple of pitchers of their excellent taps and enjoy a few of their signature pizzas.  There is even a nice seating area in the lawn out back during the summer months.  The atmosphere is always laid back and friendly.  The staff seem to always be happy to see you and are quick and efficient.The pizzas: I personally have tried about half of the specialty pizzas and I have not come across one that I did not like.  What really sets the pizzas apart is the crispy thin crust, fresh toppings and the interesting combinations.  The crust can be too thin for some people, especially on the center pieces (square cut) which can be nearly impossible to eat by hand.  This doesn't bother me since I like mine in this style.  My personal favorites are the Venetian (spinach, artichoke, olives), Gorgonzola Ribeye (steak, onions, mushrooms & gorgonzola), Treehugger (veggie pizza with marinara) and Cajun Comfort (chicken and andouille sausage with spicy cream sauce).  I have also gotten the Chicago stuffed pizza here, which was a treat.  Not quite Giordano's, but certainly the best I've had in Madison.  It took upwards of an hour, but my parents and I enjoyed a nice bottle of wine while we waited.  Picasso's does dine in, carry out or delivery.  There have been a few times we've done delivery and not received anything for over an hour.  To be fair these have been on busy weekend nights and the pizza still came hot, but because of this we do delivery only on weeknights.There is a whole lot of other items on the menu, much more than I have ever tried.  It seems that every time I come here I eye the pasta entrees but come back to the pizza.  One time I'll get adventuresome but I've only ventured off the pizza menu a couple of times for sandwiches.  My favorite is the Hot Hoagie, which is a toasted italian with a lot of cheese.  It's a bit sloppy (like their pizzas) but completely worth it.  The appetizers are always delicious.  I make it a point to get the garlic cheese bread just about every time, and the fried portabella mushrooms are great.  My father and I have also gotten the Cajun mussels - perfectly done, balancing the savory garlic butter with a bit of spice.  Lastly, the beer selection at Picasso's is bar none.  Even if you just go with the taps there is always an excellent selection of micros both local and national, combined with a great import selection.  There is a nice wine list too, but I rarely get past the taps to even consider it.  Picasso's is an excellent pizza place that is a lot more than pizza.

Review Text :
After the VYE at Desert Mission Food Bank, many of the Yelpers stuck around to grab brunch someplace in Sunnyslope. While there were a lot of options to chose from, I'm proud my fellow Yelpers decided to try a place that had yet to be reviewed: The Eye Opener Family Restaurant (formerly Tom & Tiny's). This Phoenix family-owned diner is open 7 days a week from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. for breakfast and lunch and is a morning ritual for many of Sunnyslope's longtime residents. One of my favorite things about Sunnyslope is the small town feel with access to all the urban amenities of Phoenix. Places like the Eye Opener feed that sense of place. Hal (the owner) is a kind man who loves what he does, is liable to come by your table himself to fill your coffee cup and make sure everything is OK . It is evident that he views his customers as extended family. Here are some of the things I like to eat at the Eye Opener: Standard eggs, toast and hash brown breakfast  the Chef omelet - egg whites only (filled with yummy things like ham and green chili and topped with cheese) Gyro (the tzasiki sauce is delicious and is flavored with dill!) It's not on the menu, but Hal makes his own hummus and it's just delicious!!Since moving to Sunnyslope, I've been on the lookout for good neighborhood restaurants. I'm very happy to have stumbled upon this place. The Eye Opener feels like a small-town diner and is surprisingly large inside. Everyone was incredibly friendly and the food was outstanding. I ordered the chicken fried steak, eggs and hash browns. The hash browns were sliced, sort of like thick potato chips and fried. The gravy on the chicken fried steak contained large chunks of sausage and was full of flavor, and my eggs were perfect. My meal came with two biscuits, as well. I don't think I was hungry for the rest of the day. So good, will definitely be back.Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so I feel quite qualified to give a solid four star review to The Eye Opener. Before I get to far, this is a diner. If you are a snob, spare yourself and the pleasant folk who work here and go somewhere else. The very pregnant waitress handled our very large VYE group quickly and efficiently. I don't think I could have walked across the room with a belly that big, but she glided around taking orders and delivering drinks like she was training for a marathon. Okay, I exaggerate a little. For diner coffee, I don't think it was bad at all (sorry christina!). In fact, it was way better than coffee at Denny's or IHOP. My meal was pretty tasty. I ordered an egg white omelet with green chili, hash browns and an english muffin. I was really glad to see the large portion size because after packing bags all morning, I was HUNGRY. I am pretty sure that the salsa they had sitting at the table was really pizza sauce, but fortunately they had Tabasco so I was good to go. I think my meal was like ten bucks. I tipped our lovely waitress five. My breakfast and the experience was more than worth the fifteen :)Kevin's Eye Opener ROTD was a reminder that I hadn't yelped about my experience yet!  I was part of the group that went for brunch at Eye Opener after the food bank VYE... and just like everyone else, I was impressed with this new Sunnyslope find!  It's totally a diner and you can tell there are a ton of 'regulars' there.  Our big group had fantastic service, and although I found my food to be pretty standard, I guess that's what you get when you go to most diners!  I was impressed that they did egg whites for me no problem in my mushroom and swiss omelette.  The 'swiss' was just barely melted on top, and you could tell it was a 'Kraft' single, or more likely, a generic brand single... you know what I mean - those perfect square shaped pieces.  The mushrooms were straight from a can, but I was starving, and I ate every last bite of the omelette as well as the toast and sliced tomato it came with.  Eye Opener really is a hidden gem in Sunnyslope - go check it out next time you're in the area, but probably not worth a special trip.Right off the bat they got 2 things going for them.  They open at 6 so you don't waste half the morning getting breakfast and they serve grits, with butter.I had the chefs omelet, grits and an English muffin. I happen to like my stuff cooked into the eggs and I still call it an omelet.  The food was good.  The service was good too.  If you are a first time visitor you get introduced to all the servers.  Most of the folks there seemed to be regulars.  While nothing was over the top great it is a good solid place to get breakfast or lunch.

I wish I had talked Zoe into Siu Wok...Ugh.  Ok, this place is cheap.  That's always a plus.  We wanted take-out from the buffet.  You get a card (kinda like at Chino Bandito) and mark what you want from the buffet.  Hostess takes card to the buffet and fills your take-out box.  Ok, here is where she actually GETS stars.  My box was full.  Overloaded.  Always a plus, as Chinese take-out is always good the next day.  Lo Mein, sesame chicken, egg roll (she gave me 2!), beef with broccoli, some shrimp thing and BBQ pork ribs.  8.18 with tax for what has turned out (so far) to be 4 meals.  There is a complete lack of flavor for most of the dishes.  The only one that actually HAD flavor was the ribs.  The rest?  MEH.  I never use "meh," but in this case, it works.There was only one packet of soy sauce in the bag.  No sweet and sour for my egg rolls.  The lo mein?  No flavor.  Shrimp thing?  Actually had shrimp in it, but, still, no flavor.I'm a bit pissed, because I had a real craving for Chinese food.  What I really got was Grandma making Chinese that Gramps could eat without feeling it the next day.Me, I'm not feeling this place at ALL.  The only thing that got them stars was the size of the take-out portion and the price.  MEH.

Restaurant name  300 East
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've been to 300 East now for both dinner and lunch and I can't choose a favorite. The location is splendid and conveniently located off of East Blvd, the old house is outfitted nicely to fit the targeted ambiance, and the food matches everything above. Our last visit consisted of a few apps and entrees: Baked French Onion - Small crock, croutons, textbook flavor, gratuitous provalone baked on top. Can't find a thing I don't love about it. Sweet Potato Ravioli - Nice mix of savory, sweet, and creamy flavors. A little too heavy on the cream sauce, but the rav was al dente and sang on the forefront with holiday-esque spice. Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - The dressings alone make this salad crave-worthy. Sesame, soy, ginger, hoisin, of which are perfectly balanced. The tuna was gorgeous and was even better with each bite. Much like aforementioned by the infamous Jeff S, the Matilda Wong is not only a right of passage for first-time 300 East-goers, but for booze lovers everywhere. It's 32oz pitcher, quite literally, filled with three different kinds of booze. It tastes like liquid candy and goodness gracious I love it. Parking is straight up atrocious. Forget about feeling comfortable leaving your car behind this old house. A half dozen signs screaming "Your car will be tortured by a towing service if left here." Not the most comforting parking arrangement. Find a space on the street if you can.Regardless, this place rules. Pricepoint is fair, food is great, booze is even better.

Restaurant name  Zarra's A Taste of Southern Italy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I came here with my parents this past Fri. evening at around 6pm.  I live a few blocks away and Zarra's was one of the closest places I had bookmarked.  Given that my mom is a picky eater and enjoys casual Italian eateries, and that my parents were staying in Oakland (not at the hotel across the street, FWIW), I figured it was as good of a reason as any to check it out. Zarra's is most definitely an old school red sauce joint, so it fits the bill for Pittsburgh Italian comfort food--don't come here if you're expecting trendy, cutting-edge fare.For our entrees, my mom had the meatless lasagna ($16), my dad has the Zarra's sampler ($22), and I had the ricotta noodles ($18).  All of the entrees came with side salads, as well as a shared bread plate.  The bread was insubstantial and mediocre, and came with an oil dipping sauce, which is a good thing, since it wouldn't have held up to butter.  The salads were along the same lines, consisting of spinach dressed with a vinaigrette sauce and a few vegetables that most likely came out of a can.  You can get blue cheese on your salad, which my mom and I did, or anchovies, as my dad did, but just be aware that these additions come at an upcharge.Fortunately, the entrees were better.  The manicotti had an interesting pointy shape and light texture that was different than any I've eaten before.  Flavorwise, they weren't too exciting, which was also true for the red sauce.  Each entree came with a side of sausage, meatball, or eggplant, so I chose the latter for mine since I'm inherently leery of ground meat.  The eggplant added some variety to the dish, but I found it a bit on the mushy side.  My mom and dad enjoyed their entrees--my mom is picky about the composition of lasagna, so I was happy to see that she ate it without picking it apart.  I tried a bite of it, and it was pretty similar to the lasagna she makes at home, which is probably why.  I didn't try any of the other items, so I can't directly comment on them except to say that the meatballs are huge (about 3" in diameter and twice the size of meatballs I've had at the meatball joint downtown).  I wanted to try the baked Alaska since I'd never had one, but my parents were too full to share it with me, and I didn't want to get stuck eating the whole thing, so we ended up passing on it.Overall, we were generally satisfied with our meal at Zarra's, despite the lackluster start to the meal.  The fare was exactly what I expected, satisfying my mom's pickiness and filling us all up after a long day of travel or work.  The service was excellent, as was proper given that we were about the only ones in the restaurant other than a few people sitting on the porch by the time we left.  As others have mentioned, the decor--right down to the toilet seat in the women's restroom--is interesting and eclectic, and makes for good conversation.  While I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back sometime--perhaps to try the baked Alaska--given its convenience to my apt.  3.5 stars.

Restaurant name  Michael's Frozen Custard
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Let me begin by saying I am a native of Madison and have been a lifelong lover of Michael's since it opened in 1986.  Let me also state that my rating is partly a protest vote against the asinine dance music that is incessantly  blared at the Monroe St. location.  The music has become so annoying I am struggling to bring myself to enjoy stopping by any longer.  I've asked the employees why it's played and I'm told "it's the owner's iPod" and that the employees basically can't do anything about it.  That said, let's get to business:Michael's is Madison's local independent custard joint.  It's been around since the 1980s and has a solid history in the Monroe Street neighborhood where this location is located.  As far as frozen custard goes, Michael's is pretty good but it's just not what it once was.  Even I have to admit that rapidly expanding, yet Wisconsin based Culver's offers better custard today.  I've returned to Madison from Los Angeles for a couple weeks every summer for about 10 years and Michael's has gradually lost a lot of its appeal.The Custard:  It's not as creamy as it once was but the real problem is that the flavors are losing creativity and failing to come together as they once did.  Case in point: my wife's Mint Chip had no chips tonight while another patron's was overflowing with chocolate chips.  The quality control is not there.  The texture is lacking the creaminess so important in good custard.  And the flavors rarely have fresh berries - a sign that the custard is just not made fresh like it once was.  The employees were once local teenagers, usually West High Students or Edgewood High students that looked like they were having fun and engaging the customers.  Today, employees are disengaged and give you the impression they're just going through the motions.  They do the job...but that's it.  The store itself is reasonably clean but it's the details that count.  The fluorescent lights are covered in bugs and spider webs, the parking lot is deteriorating, and the store basically needs some investment (bathrooms, lighting, landscaping etc...)This takes me to my final point: the Music.  It drives my totally crazy.  Why is a Frozen Custard stand in Madison Wisconsin that is covered in kitschy 1950'sesque décor blaring club music every time I go there (this has been a constant for several years now)?  If the custard was perfect and the customer service impeccable, fine, I'll live with it.  But Michael's is a restaurant that has disengaged ownership and functions as a conveyor belt of cash to the owner's pocket.  It's the worst kind of independent retail: retail that doesn't care about customers because they'll keep coming back.  In the end it's sad to admit as a proud Madisonian that my Milwaukee friends are correct:  Kopp's is better.  Oh how I miss what you once were Michael's Frozen Custard.

Restaurant name  The Bread Company

Review Text :
Something has got to be done about the abominable service at The Bread Company.. It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, "are there potatoes and salad?" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, "didn't we go over this already?!" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.

There are only two reasons i would return to Arizona. 1. To visit my cousin!! 2. Momma's French Toast Breakfast OMG...this place is to die for! I came here for breakfast and ordered the Mommas French Toast. Seriously the best french toast I have ever had...even...SHHH don't tell grandma...but yes better than my grandmas! They use sourdough toast to make the french toast and omg just so good. I'm just sad they don't have them in California. Service was Excellent.. I think her name was Yesenia ...but yeah she was awesome! Our coffee and Ice tea was full at all times!! I am already planning my trip in December and Cracker Barrel is definitely one of my stops on my way!

Review Text :
When I first moved to Phoenix a few years back I lived by PV Mall. Most of the restaurant selections there are of the chain variety. Chili's. Island Burger. Outback. Blah, blah, blah. Yuck, yuck, yuck. Then my roomie took me to My Florist. Upon entering this delicious, open, artsy, space, I heard angels sing. Had the Phoenix culinary heavens finally allowed me to enter? Has the mundane hell of robotic chain service combined with predictable and flavorless fare finally fanned its way out my new life in Phoenix? Had it? Had it? Well, yes and no.  My first experience was a bit tarnished as I sat with my roomie and the owner and was getting the VIP treatment. We noshed on fabulous cheeses, jams and breads. Drank endless amounts of champagne. Excuse me, but is your hand on my knee? Hmm...didn't care. Was having fun. Sampled an array of average to pretty good desserts. Servers seemed afraid of said owner. I was tipsy, flirty and fresh meat in a new town. Oh did I mention I also could have used a manager or server job? That said, I had a fun night and couldn't wait to go back. Well, I've been back several times. Here's what I think. The sandwiches can be yummy but are quite small. Salad can be good, but not always cold and fresh. Stick with the cheese and bread type thing, get hammered on some champagne and all is well. It can be hard to get service here as I have left twice after not even being said hello to. When I was there they had an amazing pianist play in the evenings. I couldn't believe guests actually had the nerve, the nerve I say, to ask her to play softer! Ugh! Go home to your Siamese and a Lean Cuisine honey. All the best yelpers!My Florist Cafe is misunderstood - by nearly everyone. Living in Phoenix you get used to how things are. If you own a food spot, it's either a coffee shop, a bar, or restaurant. Much like the clear zoning lines between residential and commercial, Phoenix food spots are either this or that, and rarely allowed to be anything else - it would be too confusing.So while the complaints about My Florist cover a variety of subjects from the lousy menu, the lousy food, and the lousy service, it's only compounded by the fact that when you enter My Florist, you're expecting to enter an actual restaurant. Someplace you can get hot food, drinks and listen to jazz music while sitting there pretending you're in a completely different city. One that's more metropolitan, one that's more urban and cool, one that doesn't shut down at 10 o'clock.My Florist Cafe fails, consistently and miserably. Oddly, years of bad service, bad food, and surprisingly boring bread haven't stopped people from giving this place a chance. Over and over again.Sure they have one of the best jazz pianists in all of Phoenix (at least that you can find easily without having to be in any sort of music circles), but is that really enough? With the servers dressed up, disappearing regularly and delivering plates full of hard, nearly unedible bread, while having no knowledge at all about any of the wines they're suggesting, why do people continue to frequent this place?I think our expectations are too high. Take away the bad service, don't expect too much out of the food, disregard any of the servers suggestions regarding wine and what do you have? Probably one of the more unique atmospheres you can find in Phoenix. For the price and the location, there really isn't anything like the ambiance you'll get at My Florist Cafe.With an upscale decor, enough tables to comfortably fit a small group, the jazz piano in the background and the hum of coversation filling the room, I would dare say that there isn't anything like this anywhere else in Phoenix. Sure there are different places to go such as Chez Nous, but comparing the two would be wrong. Where Chez Nous is a great, dark, soulful R&B lounge, My Florists is excellently open and bright.However, in the end My Florist Cafe has spent years and years unchanged. You can only say a restaurant could be so much more for so long. After a while, you decide to give up on it. You decide that it really won't change. You decide that for some unknown reason, the servers are different every week and so are their managers - but at least the woman playing piano can generally be counted on.My advice? Try My Florist once a year. Don't order any food, and definitely don't order any bread. Bring some friends, order a bottle of wine of your own choosing, not the server's suggestions, and have a great time in one of Phoenix's few unique cafes.I'm pretty sure I've figured the conundrum of My Florist out, because it is nothing if not a challenge to logical reasoning everywhere.  See if you agree...People who rave about it - because you know they're out there, we've all heard them - live in places like Scottsdale, or Tempe, or Gilbert, or Mesa, or Peoria or CHANDLER. And they're woman of a certain age demographic. And they wear floral prints and drive a Lexus and have above average but spiritually empty occupations. They have a couple of kids who excel in school and play sports. For these wonderful women who I don't understand on any level, it's home. It's a place to go and eat the food they're supposed to be eating and drink the iced teas they're supposed to be drinking and talk about their lives and enjoy each other. One recommendation. I hate hate hate valet parking. I HATE it so much. Once they broke my convertible top and additionally couldn't figure out how to drive my Prius. I won't turn over my keys to them. I park across the street. I do what I have to do. Get rid of it. Die die die... So anyway, the food is blander than bland. The servers are friendly enough but it's always been slow in my experience. I just don't get it other than it fits exactly one demographic and they drag the rest of us there. I'm sorry if I've offended you with this analysis. But if the shoe fits.We went to My Florist with four other people we met through Yelp. The idea was to have brunch (it was 11 am on a Sunday), but when we arrived and were seated, we were extremely disappointed to find out that they were no longer serving brunch! It was pretty hard to recover from this blow, but we were hungry and already seated, so we had to force ourselves to abandon dreams of pancakes and eggs and pick something from their lunch menu. I chose the portobello sandwich ($10.25), and my husband got the roast beef sandwich ($12.50). We both also got Bloody Marys. Both the sandwiches and drinks were disappointing. The portobello sandwich was ok, although the mushroom was a little overcooked and rubbery and the foccacia was a bit greasy. My husband's roast beef sandwich was even worse, though. Not only was the roast beef far from "rare," as the menu promised it would be, but it looked like My Florist had picked up Subway's leftover cold cuts and repackaged them in a sandwich that cost 3 times the price. The cheddar also tasted super standard (think Kraft singles). For $12.50, the sandwich should have tasted a lot more premium that it did. We did enjoy the light and bright atmosphere inside the cafe and thought it was a good environment for conversation (not too loud, but not quiet and awkward), but were very disappointed with the food. If we actually wake up early enough on a Sunday to make it there before 11, we might give this place another chance for brunch, but since we don't live that close, we probably won't go out of our way to come back.I've had pretty good experiences here. Not "unforgettable" but I'll definitely be back. I will start by echoing the half off bottles of wine thing.....fabulous. You know I like to get my vino on... and if you don't know, now you know. I have been twice now and I'll tell you, the service at the bar is fantastic. My first experience I only tried the spinach artichoke dip, which was just okay... and had something called a tira-tini for desert (which was tiramisu  in a sort of metal martini glass). It was AMAZING and I am soooooo not a desert person. The bartender that waited on us was very sweet and knowledgeable and let us try a couple of different types of wine before deciding. The second time I went to My Florist I had The Portobello Sandwich which was also pretty good...once again, not great but better than anything I would make at home so worth the trip. My only suggestion regarding the food is to focus on individual flavor a little more. Everything that I've had here other than dessert has been a little bland. That said, I still enjoyed my experiences and the service and I will return.Okay... I feel bad b/c I see a lot of great reviews for this place but honestly, I had the worst experience ever here, so I'm giving this  a straight up 1 star.  Let me make a few things clear before I get started: 1. I arrived before the lunch rush...way before the lunch rush, I was like the 1st person in the restaurant2. I was meeting friends there for a brunch/networking thing, it was four of us all together3. The bad experience started after I tipped... as most bad experience doThe food was okay, I had an omelet which was decent.. but it's hard to beat Fez's egg white omelets in my heart. But the omelet was okay, the atmosphere and decor was amazing, the service was exactly what you expect as a customer.....Then right when I put in my mental to-do list to give this place 4 to 5 stars on yelp the waiter comes and tells us, after we tipped, that the table we had was for "someone special" (who by the way didn't have a reservation) and we had to leave.... wtf? How do you tell paying customers and good tippers that they need to leave before the ink even dries on the receipts?  We were pretty upset and asked to speak to the manager, who wasn't present, but the acting manager basically gave us the boot as well. First time ever I was asked to leave a restaurant....So has this restaurant ever seen better days?I came here Friday night with my guy looking to enjoy a semi-romantic meal before heading over to the subtle sexiness that is SideBar.  I looked over the Yelp reviews, decided to give this place a try because the main complaints were about service, which I can deal with.So we walked into a mostly empty restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday, not the most comforting sign of a business.  It takes our waitress a little while to stop by our table...so we peruse the drink menu...finally she stops by and we get the Ginger Girl and the Me So Thorny.I took one sip of the Ginger Girl and my throat was immediately burning.  I like strong drinks, but this was pure gasoline.  My guy's drink wasn't any better.  Definitely stick with beer or wine at this place.After 15 minutes our waitress decides to stop by and take our order.  Apparently one can only order one course at a time.  So we order the appetizers, which was the main attraction.  Postino's bruschetta in downtown.  But it's not even close to Postino's.  The bread isn't toasted, you only get two awkward pieces of each, the toppings aren't fresh, and they definitely don't give you enough toppings!The cheese plate was alright, two really small pieces of cheese in my opinion.  They do give you a lot of bread, because that's what you're really paying for.The entrees were okay.  My crab cakes were cold, which means they weren't even close to being prepared fresh.  My guy's shrimp looked pretty good, but just tasted okay.The only saving grace of this place is the lobster bisque.  Of course it was the soup of the day, so I doubt many people will get to enjoy it.Sad place, I can see why the reviews are just average or worse.Yummy food, open till midnight, walking distance from Sidebar, fantastic pianist... HOW HAVE I NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE?!? We walked in at 1045 on a Saturday night, ever-so-slightly depressed, sober (hence the depression); the three of us.  We were seated right away, and the kind host offered us a lunch menu in addition to the three dinner menus, which I thought a bit odd, the only snafu, if you can call it that, of the evening.  I ate the cup of squash soup ($5, including a brulee'd ginger marshmallow that will blow your mind) and split the bruschetta plate ($12) and tasted the creme brulee ($7?) and thought everything was delicious.  The bruschetta, in particular, was standout and made for a great snack.  The kitchen, according to our accommodating server, closed at 1130, so I'll bear that in mind when i next get the late-night munchies.  The pianist shut down at about five, maybe ten till midnight.  We didn't leave till about 10 after midnight, quite satisfied and with spirits much lifted.  I suppose that last part may have had a little something to do with the fact the two TVs over the bar were playing Spaceballs, but also the food was delectable, so who knows.  i'll be back, and i might just bring a fifth star with me.-Fancy salad place.-Salads are very yummy.-Parking is a pain in the butt.-Pricey for lunch.

Review Text :
Excellent place and open late to boot!  If I am here with 4 or more, we usually just go with one of the dinner sets on the 1st page of the menu.  Great value and you get A TON of food.  Something is seriously wrong if you ain't totally full after that.I am a sucker for fresh squid so that is one dish I always order if it isn't a group outing.  I've been happy with everything I've ordered there.This place is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. Hands down. Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.We ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.Wow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there. The Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.The Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.The Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.The Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.Last but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.This place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret. I've been back here at least 5 times since I first discovered it. Its that good.As always, pictures are included! Yummy!"The MSG is strong in this one" , that's what I expected my fortune cookie to read after tanking 5 glasses of water and 5 cups of hot tea.But none the less the food was fantastic.Here's what we ordered for a party of 3.Scallop SoupHoney Walnut Shrimp (HUGE PRAWNS)2 lb Garlic CrabPan Fried Sea Bass with Soy Sauce Sizzling Beef platterBlack Bean ClamsRoast DuckChicken Chow Fun.God. Please forgive me for I have sinned. I am a gluttonous whore and I deserve to have an apple stuffed in my mouth and be roasted over an open flame.A Chinese hot pot place?!  Richard C. proclaimed that Joyful House offered such a treat after 10 pm!Last Friday night, the Husband and I ventured over to Spring Mountain to find out if such a thing really did exist.  We were only expecting Chinese hot pot, not AYCE for the mere price of $15.50/pp.We were easily persuaded and a quick peek at what they offered helped as well.As they set up the gas stove and dual hot pot, they also provided two dipping sauces - one being a chili oil and the other a sesame-like paste.Everything was laid out nicely on a couple of tables along the back: * octopus balls* beef balls* pork balls* wontons* dumplings* chicken* beef* pork* squid* mussels* shrimp* napa cabbage* spinach* bok choy* tofu* tofu sheets* flat rice noodles* vermicelli noodlesI'm sure they had a few other things that I forgot to mention.  Also in the broth was taro and radish.For dessert, they offered complimentary red bean soup and fortune cookies.Service was surprisingly attentive.  It was slow when we arrived shortly after 10 pm, and there were a few diners.  Business picked up with at least two large parties also enjoying the AYCE hot pot.  The staff was good at refilling our water, tea, and asking if we needed more broth in our pot.  They had a lot of staff around, so that was a good thing.Late night AYCE Chinese hot pot begins at 9 pm! 3.5 starsI chop yo chicken!!! I chop yo chicken into small chunks. I don't mince yo chicken.... I just chop into tiny juicy pieces. This is the reason why the egg drop soup with minced chicken didn't suck. Unlike Most restaurants which tend to abuse their chicken (Capitol Seafood), Joyful did chicken right like your gams gams making homemade chicken soup. But not everybody is your gam gams, and most tend to abuse their chicken because chicken is so lean it leads to dry bland chicken bits that you will choke on (I just wanted to put "choke" and "chicken" in the same sentence).The spicy and probably sour shrimp was decent, but not stellar although they did do a stand-up job on prepping those on-yerns (onions) which was sliced thinly - most Chinese restaurants will just quarter the onions.... slackers!Also ordered the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot vegetable dish. Nothing like your leafy green vegetables to keep you "regular"... this might be good for you, if you're one of those people that disappear for an hour or so with a magazine under your arm. FYI - I'm in'n'out in record time... the secret is "leafy greens".The last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinctive flavor. That's why I'll generically just say it was "decent".The reason why I tried this place out, is because I can't stand getting screwed with all the high priced, hyped up crap on the strip. Instead, I like my "crap" off the strip.... speaking of crap, those leafy greens I had earlier is working their magic.This was an easy late night staple and we've eaten here quite a bit of times. What we have gotten is pretty good and have not had a bad experience here yet. It's not the best I've had, but it is solid and specially when it comes to late night where most places go downhill in quality, I appreciate that it's consistent. We just get off of work, we're not drunk so we actually care what food tastes like.They have stuff that serves more for a friendly palette but they also have legit dishes too and have tried quite a few of those are are indeed, authentic and want to note in particular that the seafood is fresh and fairly priced. Servers are pretty friendly here too, specially since the late night crew are the same, they are familiar with us and are attentive on the drinks refillsIt's a good standby for late night eats. We are fairly regular here.Yelp Challenge 365 # 177/365Seafood at its best!!!! I would never have found this place if not for Rod U who kindly directed me to several places in the great city of Las Vegas.Unfortunately, there were no spot prawns when we dined but chose crab and shrimp in a basket with garlic and vegetables... we were there for lunch so it was just the right amount= not to heavy and enough to satisfy our appetite. Noodle dish? Cake noodle topped with more seafood and a side dish of green beans (lots of chili pepper with it too !)The food was excellent by taste and the service as excellent. Oh, parking was plentiful compared to other restaurants and shops in the Vegas Chinatown district. A definite stop if you're into seafood, chinese style!OUTSTANDING seafood."That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response."Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues."Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced."What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice."And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin"."I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.We ventured out to Joyful House with another couple and had another very good meal but not a five-star dining experience.  The broth of Seafood Wor Wonton Soup was quite flavorful, and the filled wontons very memorable, but a scary-looking Calamari, tough scallops, and inferior pork made the soup a story of contrasts.  Average-sized pan-fried Potstickers were good and I received my several requested condiments of sliced ginger, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Potsticker Sauce with onions, Hoisin Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil without any difficulty, and Shrimp-Fried Rice with carrots and peas was very good.  Beef & Snow Peas with Black Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce was a sumptuous Cantonese dish, and Kung Pao Chicken had a nice level of controlled heat.  Service by the well-trained and disciplined staff was consistently on the ball and responsive to needs.Four solid stars this time out!It was almost midnight and all I could think about was how much I wanted some chow mein. Not the kind of chow mein from a cheap, take-out place but the real stuff. I searched Chinese food in my Yelp app and Joyful House came up first on the results. The reviews had me sold, so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack. The parking lot was a little dark, but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed. The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!) I definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet. Joyful House does Chinese food right and I will definitely be back for more.Vegas + drinking + 1am = greasy chinese food cravings kick in, STRUGGLE IS REAL!! My friends & I just finished our epic spartan race and idk why but my cravings for Panda Express Orange Chicken were going on overboost. However, my friends all said that the Panda Express on the strip (the only one open that late) wasn't as good as back in OC. I ain't about to waste my calories on crappy chinese food so luckily one of my friends that live in Vegas recommended Joyful House.I was surprised walking in that there were still families eating so late, so place must be good. The workers here speak english, but if you want any modifications you better know your chinese. Thank god they spoke cantonese so I busted my chinese speakin skills on them lolWonton soup - Started off w/ this, I liked that it was just the soup w/ veggies, wontons, and bbq pork. NO NOODLES YAY! It was a very big portion, but flavor was on point and no salty MSG. In fact, their soup was actually on the lighter side and not greasy. The BBQ Pork was lean and surprisingly one of the best I've had.Honey Walnut Shrimp - Busted my chinese to ask for mayo on the side and thank god I did! I recommend you try asking for the sauce on the side also, it makes a big difference. The shrimp was all nice and crispy, not leaking out oil at all from the batter. I think that if the sauce was on it, it'd make the shrimp soggy. Very good dish and they didn't skimp on the shrimp either! We still had half the plate left to take home. The shrimp were a good medium size, not overly coated in batterCrispy Orange Chicken - I wished it were a bit more crispy, didn't really satisfy my Panda Express cravings, but can't complain. The sauce wasn't the same as Panda either, but more like a traditional Orange Chicken flavor you'd get at asian restaurants like Sam Woo. It tastes great w/ the steamed white rice. I would say skip this and try another entree, it's not a TDF itemYang Chow Fried Rice - Fried rice w/ BBQ pork & Shrimp! You can get it chinese style which is Plain, Soy Sauce Free - Pan fried with Eggs and Shredded Cabbage, or American Style which has soy sauce. The fried rice was pretty good and again the BBQ pork was delicious! Really big portion, we had to take the rest home. Unlike most chinese restaurants, they didn't skimp on the bbq pork and shrimp! It wasn't too greasy either so brownie points for thatThey give you sweet and refreshing orange slices at the end of your meal which helped the hefty meal go down! Our total bill came out to be about $50 w/ tax which isn't bad. It's a great place for value, you get a lot for what you pay! Hits the midnight munchies in Vegas and the food tasted pretty authentic :)

Review Text :
What can I say about The Cage that others haven't already said, based on my lone visit last night at 6?  I don't know, but for the sake of brevity, I'll sum up my visit with a pro-con list.Pros:1. Cheap, decent food.  My BLT ($4.25) was delightful, with crispy, juicy bacon and crisp, fresh lettuce--only the hothouse tomatoes disappointed.  Get the fries--they're hand-cut and delicious!  I tried some from a companion, and regretted not upgrading to a platter to get them.2. I can't comment on the drinks myself, since I'm not drinking at present, but everyone says they're good--and they're cheap, too.  I got a club soda ($1.25).3. Interesting people watching opportunities.  I wasn't able to take advantage of them due to concentrating on group discussion with my table mates, but the bits and pieces that I saw and overheard were amusing.Cons:1. Smoky.  If you're sensitive to cigarette smoke, don't come here!  When I first entered, I thought I might be okay with it, but then the table next to ours started smoking.  I could smell smoke on myself for the rest of the night until I changed and showered.2. Slow service.  Our waitress wasn't the swiftest or the most friendly, and it took 20 min. to get my BLT.  Getting change took way too long, too.3. $10 credit card minimum. I suspected this would be the case, so I hit the ATM next door before coming.  Plan accordingly.Quite honestly, though I enjoyed the food and company, I doubt I'll be back here soon due to the smoke.  Increasing my risk for lung cancer and reeking of eau de cigarette isn't my idea of a fun, relaxing night out.  If you don't mind that and the slow service, though, then by all means, stop by for some inexpensive, delicious food and drinks and take advantage of the interesting people watching opportunities.

Review Text :
First (and only) Half of Review: I happened into this dive bar/grill recently since it's near my NoPho / Ghettro-Center 'hood. Stackers gets points for having a few different beers on tap (Bass, I can't remember the rest) along with the regular boring finds. That's all I was there for at the time. I did not eat, but they seemed to offer a lot in the way of typical bar food. Maybe they have super delicious food, maybe not. I'll never know. There would have been a second half to this review. There would have been a follow-up where I found the place interesting enough to go back when I could sample the food, too, because I did find the place interesting enough to warrant that second visit. That's what I was planning to do as I sipped my beer. But there isn't going to be a second half to this review. It all came down to watching a skinny dude in a cap come in from out front -- obviously smoking cigarettes -- and proceed to gather ingredients and utensils and then actually make what looked like a big jug of tartar sauce, or something, and then prepping other items, WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.!! This is inexcusable. Skinny cap dude was not the cook at the time, a young lady was at the grill, but he was doing prep work in the back.  The trouble seemed like only him, so I resist my temptation to hard-nose and give only 1 star, and give them 2 instead.I had so completely planned to go back and try out what seemed like it was going to be some good bar & grill grub, but I just couldn't bring myself to do so. Maybe if I were to run out of other places to check out I'll try it again, but not if skinny cap dude is anywhere in my sight. For me Stacker's has fallen before even getting a chance, like a barely played out game of Jenga ruined by a clumsy player.

Oh Gino! Why did you leave me!I was only able to experience your lovely pizza once, but oh how I miss you.I deeply miss the excessive heap of crust, the copious amount of cheese, and the tremendous layer of tomato sauce, which you so wonderfully crafted. Deep dish pizza is now a pastime in Madison, something on which I nostalgically reflect. The Chicagoan in me deliciously craves this concoction that is currently nonexistent in this here county, much to my chagrin. Please come back.

I was in the neighborhood for lunch and I was so pleased the other day when I first experienced this place, so I came back for more!The owner remembered me and had that same pleasing and chill attitude! Brought over the boiled peanuts quickly and took my order promptly as well:Fish Jun: Alaska Pollock Fish Fillet dipped/wrapped in egg! I loved the Meat Jun so I wanted to try the fish version this time. Well, it was the same difference!! So Mother Freakin' Good!! Soo "ONO" as the islanders would say! Once its dipped in their sauce, its a done deal. I had to ask what was the origin of the "----- Jun".... The Owner told me that it was Koreans in Hawaii that started making this back in the day.. Gamsahabnida! (Thank you!) Koreans from Hawaii! I was also brought the napa cabbage, radish and sprouts (korean sides). On top of that, a small bowl of hot Saimin soup to cleanse the palate. Nice! Again, A Completely Positive Experience!!You know the saying.....you can judge your main dish by how great the side dishes taste.  It's an older generation korean saying about how to judge a restaurant and their food quality.  Of all the Korean restaurants that I've been to, this place has to be the best in town! About 10 minutes from the strip, I highly recommend coming here for all your korean OR hawaiian food cravings.   Of course being a Yelpy, I found this on my phone app and noticed their great ratings by a lot of people.  Since bf loves hawaiian food and I absolutely need my kimchi fix at least once a day, this sounded like a perfect place to satisfy both our cravings.  Don't expect anything fancy.  It's located in a ghetto strip mall with nothing so glitzy like the strip.   But don't let that fool you!  I was skeptical about how their food would taste like when both the server and the owner were NOT korean.  However, once the big slab of kimchi came out along with the other side dishes, it was game over.   Even my mom was very impressed with the way they make their kimchi.  Then again, even my bf who doesn't EVER eat kimchi actually ate it!  Now that's saying a lot about how great and awesome they prepare their kimchi. My favorite was their radish kimchi.   We asked for more to take it back to the hotel with us!  Oh yeah, haven't even said anything about the main dishes yet.  lol  My mom and I shared the hot stone pot rice with veggies.  (dolsot bibimbap)  which was surprisingly good.  I especially loved the little pieces of marinated beef on top of the rice.  BF got the meat jun which he thought was very yummy.  He gives it 5 stars!  We also shared the fried dumplings and I loved the crispy won ton skin!  The overall experience was very positive and satisfying.    This is our Must Go to place in Vegas!The owner said his wife makes EVERYTHING herself and they also have another restaurant inside the Greenland market nearby.   Wish I can have her kimchi recipe.  I miss it.   I hope this restaurant stays for many more years to come so I can come visit whenever we're in Vegas!Second time I've been here. Better than the first...It's definitely the laid-back Hawaiian casual dining you'd find in the Islands, serving awesome Hawaiian & Korean food. Prices seem a little bit higher than their competitors, but you easily forget that when your food arrives. The portions are big, plentiful side dishes, and a vast menu, consisting of Loco Moco, fried rice, spam & eggs, to traditional Korean dishes like Bi Bim Bap, spicy tofu soup, and Kalbi. Last time I was there, I intended to get take-out. The staff greeted me warmly and saw that I had a grocery bag with me as I looked at the menu. They politely suggested I eat there, and offered to keep my milk chilled in their side fridge. Is that awesome or what?!?! I did end up eating there, ordered the Bi Bim Naeng Myun/Kalbi Combo, and took most of it home. How great was that for them to offer?!Service I received both visits were great, very friendly, and the staff always thanked and welcomed the customers back soon when they got up to leave. This is a no-frills casual hole-in-the-wall. What you get is a place that welcoming, friendly, and just plain great food, period. Definitely worth a try, then you'll be back for more...They are called Island Style but once you see their menu, you will discover that they serve Hawaiin, Korean, and American dishes.First off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it. So I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.I ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). I probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat. So overall, I wasnt really blown away. My bill was about 10 dollars. I tipped 2 bucks which was what I thought was more than generous considering my mediocre experience. I dont think I will be going out of my way just to eat here.2 words: Meat Jun.I just discovered meat jun on a recent trip to Hawaii with my boyfriend.  I'm so happy that he introduced me to this simple yet super tasty dish that I have just fallen completely in love with.  Thank you Jeremy C.!  Every since I had it at 3 different restaurants in Oahu, I had to find one in Vegas.Verdict: Island Style does not disappoint.  It is almost as close to the meat jun served at Millions in Oahu.  Flavorful well season beef inside a hefty egg batter served over white rice or fried rice!  Don't forget to dip it in their tasty sauce for an amazing trip in your mouth!Their dumplings here are a great appetizer too!  And the workers here; I believe a family that used to live in Oahu, are super nice and friendly.  We chopped it up with them about the Islands and food!  My boyfriend and I will definitely be back for the meat jun and to try their other menu items!  They're straight from Hawaii so I'm sure the rest of the food here is legit!  Yum!Eh cuz, we go grind!Food from the 808.  Well kinda.  More like Korean take out and a spam musubi on the side for good measure.  Rant:1.  Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it "Hawaiian".3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me "brah" or asking if I "hang ten" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.How does it stack up?Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys. A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.A-OK.  Kanak attack.  Out.Came here a few weeks ago with some work friends for a goodbye lunch.  Still lots of aloha spirit at Island Style!I was feelin' the Korean vibe that day so I went with a staple, the Bi Bim Bop.  Rice topped with bulgogi beef with lots of veggie sides like pickled carrots & daikon, bean sprouts, spinach, and cucumber, all topped off with a runny sunny side up egg, sesame seeds & seaweed!  Comes with a side of broth too for pouring over.  Delicious!  Love that runny egg yolk combining with the hot rice & bulgogi, then getting the crunch from the cool veggies.  That's some good eats!  I should have opted for a dollar or 2 more for the Bi Bim Bop in the hot stone pot, would have been sizzling hot from beginning to end.Island Style has the hookup for banchan too!  Who else in town served boiled peanuts as banchan?  Such a good start to a meal.  I had no shortage of other banchan either - kim chee, kim chee cucumbers, bean sprouts & more.  Sides to my hearts content!I also got a Cheeseburger as well.  Surprisingly simple & tasty!  Flat top grilled meat, cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce & tomato, bun.  And lots of mayo & ketchup just the way I like it!  Opted for no fries, needed to keep the calorie count down LOL.Island Style I'll be back again when I need me some down home eats!Hawaiian!  Oh....and Korean!

Five years later, still good. Azteca has all the stuff you would want in a Mexican restaurant - Telemundo on the television, burritos and tacos, rice and beans, imported beers from south of the border, chips and salsa, and a wait staff that understands enough English to bring you a carne asada with flour tortillas.Food is good. Chips are good. Salsa is good. It's A-OK.

Review Text :
How I love thy beans and rice,The way you're layered is wicked nice,With sour cream and guac galore,F'yeah may I have some more?Oh, and your Carnitas too.And the Bandito Sauce.Please & Thank you.Yep 4 stars to 1 star... new owners need a dose of reality. If the Burrito Bandito website has your store number and address on there still you would imagine that they are the same owners. I guess not. The new owners have different prices different menu items and different customer service skills. As I mentioned in my previous review, I have been eating BB since day one... the day they opened. Yesterday was my last day there EVER... Me: "Do you deliver still?" Her: "Pssshh.. we have for the past 9 months!" Me: "bummer the website did not mention that" Her Blank Stare Me: "Can I have the 3-way chimi, not the combo, with guac? " Her:Rolling eyes.... "That would be a burrito" Me: "I would like it deep fried, Unless the Chimi combo is cheaper? " Her:Rolling eyes..."Huh.... ummm... its a few cents cheaper" (burrito is 4.99 chimi combo is 6.99) Me: "Ok I will have the burrito deep fried with guac on the side." Her: blank stare Me: "I would alos like the kids meal taco" (supposed to be a mini taco, 2 banditos rice and beans) Her: blank stare Me "I would also like the #6" Her: Huh...what else? etc.... 4 more customer come in and order and she was as rude to them as she was me. Not a smile the entire time. I get home: SURPRISE The chimi had no guac on the side... it was inside and the kids meal had NO banditos...So I call... Her: The kids meal does not come with banditos. Me: The website shows...and I read it to her. Her: That is the other store only. Me Then why is you phone and address on there? Her: The owner will not remove it... Me: Ok but you still shorted me my...nevermind....CLICK YOU JUST CAN'T FIX STUPID!!

Review Text :
I have to admit, I had probably driven by this place hundreds of times without ever giving it a thought. After all, what kind of authenticity could I expect from a place with such a silly name? Who is this Mr. Chop Chop, and is he the mascot of the restaurant? Well, OBVIOUSLY I was a fool. A silly, misguided fool! Whoever Mr. Chop Chop is, I'd definitely want to be his friend. We've ordered from them twice and its been consistently flavorful and fast. The boy always gets a red curry when we have thai, and the first time he got a Mongolian beef that he enjoyed. Last time we ordered the curry, spicy mint pork, chicken satay, tom yum kai and crab rangoon. The rangoon was fat with cream cheese and a bit of crab, and the wontons were light and crispy. The curry was spicy and had lots of vegetables with juicy bits of chicken. I love tom yum kai and use it as my gauge, and their's was great. It had a definite home-made feel, with big chunks of galangal and lemongrass. The chicken was tender and definitely a lot fresher than some of the other places I've tried. They put strips of jalapeno into the soup and it was definitely spicy! The satay came with a peanut sauce and some sweet vinegar pickles that were delicious! A great compliment to the rich peanut sauce. The pork was also good, with a medley of vegetables and lots of chunks of fresh garlic. The meat was flavorful without being dense or overly porky, and the mint was a great addition. It made the whole dish taste lighter, fresher and more balanced. The delivery was relatively quick, within an hour, and we were very satisfied with the spice level. Most places go easy on it doubting our abilities as caucasians, leaving me to dump chili sauce into it. That was definitely not the case here, my first bite of the tom yum kai was a  shock. So spicy! It was great! I appreciate their generosity with the spice. We only got one rice with the meal, but it was enough for the meal. I may need to make a fresh batch for the leftovers, of which there is plenty. We got a ton of food for about $40 with enough for another meal. If we hadn't been so enthusiastic about trying things, we probably could have gotten a third meal out of it. Yummy food and close to home, I look forward to trying more of their offerings.

Review Text :
Worst Chinese food I have ever had by a Chinese owned and run restaurant EVER.  What the hell were their mothers cooking for them when they were kids to think this was passable?     Jenny, Chad, Debra...you're all right.  It was my fault for not looking at any of the reviews until I checked in after picking up my order.  I actually considered bringing this whole bag back for a refund without trying any of it.  Then the Yelper denial kicked in.  I thought "Well...Jenny's review was a few months ago and I ordered different stuff so maybe it will be better.".  Everyone is Chinese here so how bad can it be??  OH BABY IT'S BAD!!! Their "family dinner" special looked so enticing.  You get 2 entrees with soup, pork fried rice, 2 egg rolls and crab rangoon for $24.99.  That usually means leftovers but it actually meant straight to the garbage can in reality.Hot and sour soup:  I'll give them credit for soup being hot.  1 out of 2!  Nice job.  I am not sure how they managed to make the soup bland and very oily but they did.  Chicken and broccoli: The quality of the chicken was rubbery.  My chihuahuas enjoyed it and gave it 3 out of 5 Yelp stars.  Shrimp and garlic sauce:  When was the last time garlic sauce was red and uber-sweet?  Eff you, chef.  Pork fried rice:  The best of the worst and it still lacked a lot of flavor.  I was in such disbelief that I actually called them to let them know how bad it all was.  The person I spoke with said they'd save my phone number and I'd get a free entree the next time I order.  HA!  Maybe if I were contemplating suicide!I would advise all of the reviewers that bestowed 5 Yelp stars to Cheng's Express to avoid Chinese restaurants like KJ's, HK Star and Wendy's Noodle unless you've consulted a neurosurgeon first because your brain would EXPLODE if you ate at any of those spots.

Lets talk about carbs, baby...Pasta & Provisions does it right. I want to "carb load" every day of my life when I come to this side of town. I have such a hard time coming in here and only buying what I came in for. Guaranteed, I always leave with a least one bag of meat ravioli and one container of meatballs and pomodoro sauce. They have everything labeled and it's easy to find. If you can't, ask someone everyone is super helpful and friendly. I love the family meal deal. Let's be honest - I'm a single girl. The family meal deal feeds me for days - for $20! Winning!! And now it's available every day. Score. I will come here time and time again. There's different daily specials, and we're talking like real "omg. I must come on a Tuesday" specials. Fresh, delicious. Bring your own bag - you won't get in trouble if you don't, but it's appreciated. Lovely, local gem.Eat pasta, run fasta!

Restaurant name  Romanelli's Deli & Bakery
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Romanelli's is the most amazing italian deli that one can ever come across in Phoenix. It is located down the street from the high school that I went to and we used to stop most days for some cheese pizza or "Italian Stallion" sandwich. Now that I have grown this is a prime place to shop for my own culinary needs such as pastas, cold cuts, pizza toppings, sauces and even hommade pizza dough just waiting to be thawed and used to make your own delicious pizzas.I still stop in for the occassional sandwish and the "Italian Stallion" is still my top choice. Ham, capicolla,  grnoa salami, pepperoni and provalone cheese piles high with onions thinnly shredded lettuce tomatoes and of course bread soggy with dressing as it should be. And don't forget to follow it up with your favorite italian sweet. I haven't had a bad dessert yet.The service is prompt and charmingly brusque. A real New York feeling here. If its authenticity you are after this is your place..anywhere else? Fuggedaboudit!!OMG Korina A is crazy!!!! I followed Nathan and Kris. Romanellis is OUTSTANDING!!!! Delicious subs I will be back again and again. I will tell all my friends this is delish! You have to try the Italian sausage sub YUMMMMMMM!I love the meats and cheeses and the atmosphere. You can get anything you like Italian in this joint. LOVE IT! Right up the street from my house can't be beat!This must be my lucky month. I'm discovering more and more places that serve foods that remind me of my favorite stomping grounds in NYC. I've been to Romanelli's earlier this year, on March 19 - the feast of St. Joseph, to see if they sold those wonderful special filled zeppoles named after the saint and sold in Italian bakeries and food stores on his feast day. They did, and the pastries were delicious. I also browsed the packaged and canned goods areas and found lots of high quality Italian foods not normally found in supermarkets and regular food stores. But it was today after reading the reviews here that I decided to try the deli. I ordered the Italian Stallion sub and it was really, really good! The meats were very high quality, fresh and ample, and there was just enough lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, and dressing to enhance the flavors without competing with the deli meats. It's so good to know that there is a great deli place not far from where I live, and where I can treat myself to or bring visiting friends for a great New York style deli experience.Is this the best Italian Deli / Bakery that I've ever been to? No. Is this the best one in the Valley area? Absofrigginlutely!!! This is the ONLY place that I know of in this metro area that you can select from eight varieties/brands of San Marzano Tomatoes. If you have to ask why that is significant enough to merit 5 stars... then I can only imagine that you haven't spent decades attempting to perfect your Pomodoro or Pizza Sauce. Combine this with the fact that they almost always have Rainbow cookies available and some of the best fresh Italian breads, and you have achieved two-thirds of an almost idyllic Italian meal. Before you leave the store, make sure you take a leisurely stroll along the back wall. This is what I like to consider a little piece of heaven on earth. Every imaginable cheese / meat you've ever heard uttered by the Mario's, Lydia's, and Giada's of this world can be found in the case that runs the entire length of the store. Want to create an out of this world antipasto selection for your next get together? Seriously if you can't find it in that case, you are trying to live up to Captain Jack Harkness standards, and although I adore him... he is a work of fiction! And I have to agree with Nathan; they make one hell of a sandwich, but I've never sampled any of their other eat in/take out items, so my input is limited on that side of the house. This is not a "pretty" place. It's not trendy or new and it is located in yet another strip mall. But it is a fully functional, family run, local business that is operated by two of the nicest guys you would ever want to meet. As far as quality and friendliness goes, this place rocks! I discovered Romanelli's about 25 years ago (remember... it's not polite to ask a girl's age) and let's just say, they had me at ciao. : )Can't wait to have a real reason to go back here. We were doing a foodie market tour today and this was suggested as our last stop( my buddy Tom had to take home fresh cannolis home to the womenfolk). My plan is to go back for delicious sub sandwiches since this place is close to work . Why haven't gotten lunch here already ?  They have great Italian grocery supplies like the Stella Dora cookies I remember as a kid living in Jersey.  I also perused the San Marino tomatoes and pondered the differences from "regular" canned tomatoes. At 7.00 bucks a can I guess I won't ever know. I rather spend my money on baked goodies in the front case. My husband , the wonderful Michael  surprised me with a eclair . You know he loves me!Maybe in the early 80's this was the coolest shnitzel in the 'hood, but now it's just plain spaghetto.Really not impressed at all.Tiny portions.  Mediocre quality, at best.  Too much bread($) for not enough meat(meat).This place is riding on its reputation, but where it got its rep, i'm not sure.If you're a fan, then hey, more for you.  I'm not coming back unless someone makes me an offer i can't refuse.This place has been here for over 35 years, not a lot of time on the East coast. But, here in AZ where no building lasts for more than 60 years , it is astonishing!True right up front, it is in a rough hood. But, maybe you should just go during the day.The selection here in the Groceries is without comparison. They have everything Italian you could want.....Imported from Italy. Of course.They make their own sausage there,(you can buy it in the meat case.) It is by far, THE BEST we have ever had any where.It even drove the dog crazy when I just brought it in the house. The smell is so good! The choices for the food and cook ware,as well as gifts are fantastic. I have not been able to eat lunch there but ,next time we will. So far the first 3 times have just been Grocery shopping.I live just over 50 miles round trip from this Deli , Bakery. Every mile is worth it.I cannot believe I had never been here till October.I have since recommended it to every Italian I know. Oh yes, it is that good.If I could give them 10 stars ,I would.

Restaurant name  Mineo's Pizza House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The current star rating of 3.5 stars is incredibly accurate of Mineo's.  I'm going to be unpopular and round up to 4 stars because I think Mineo's is a more unique pizza than other places in Pittsburgh.  You're going to be indifferent or love it.  I'm confused about my emotions, clearly.Disclaimer:  I did not order a pie here, only two slices.Mineo's crust is unique.  It's thin but not like cheap Pizza Hut burnt-to-a-crisp-thin pizza.  It's almost like the dough doesn't rise the whole way or something, but it worked for me.  The sauce was ok, not too special.  But I love cheese, and this pizza was swimming in cheese.  It was pretty fast for my two slices to come out, and at $1.70/slice, not terribly priced.I actually had really friendly service while I was there so I'm not sure about those complaints.  The tables were a little dirty and some weirdos were sitting inside.  Not pizza items were super slow, but it's not a huge kitchen.  I wasn't totally shocked by that.  I would come back here for a few slices on a laid-back night.Cash OnlyI stopped by on Tues. for a quick dinner of a couple slices on my way to a gathering in Squirrel Hill. I'd tried Mineo's pizza before several years ago, and I remembered enjoying it, but it'd been long enough that I'd forgotten the specifics. Thus, my visit gave me the opportunity to retry and review this legendary pie.I ordered two plain cheese slices ($3.40), which only took about 5 min. to warm up. Upon biting into them, they seemed promising due to the generous helping of cheese and crispy crust (my personal pizza hangup). However, upon tasting the flavors, I was let down. This is one of the blandest pizzas I've ever tasted--the sauce was nearly flavorless, and the crust tasted like cardboard and had an odd texture (definitely not thin, but not really pan style, either).  The only flavor I clearly tasted was the cheese, which was accompanied by a greasy aftertaste.  Even the addition of oregano and garlic powder did little to increase the complexity of the flavors.  How disappointing!While the price and service were right, unfortunately, the pizza failed to measure up--esp. in light of my past experience, not to mention the numerous awards Mineo's has won over the years.  Based on those factors and some of the other Yelp reviews, it seems that Mineo's has gone downhill.  At any rate, I'll stick to Aiello's for the time being, and will keep searching for the magic perfect pie-in-the-sky pizza in Sq. Hill.

To my utter surprise, this place is fantastic. I'll be honest in the fact that these holes in the wall scare me a bit since I have no idea what to expect. I have driven by this seafood spot for a couple of years and always laughed at the name. Last night, I was in the mood for Mexican and the hubby in the mood for seafood and something healthy. I really wanted chips and guacamole, which by the looks of the menu, they do not sell. No matter as I am always a sucker for some ceviche. There were seafood dishes galore and prices ranging from inexpensive (my small shrimp ceviche $5) to mixed seafood dishes for $18. Some of the more expensive dishes are offered as a daily special which can save you a few bucks on certain days. Our food came with tostada shells and per my request, avocado on the side ($2). It was a small whole avocado cut in half so very fresh. My ceviche was awesome, especially with the avocado. My husband had a crabmeat tostada and I was amazed at the amount of crabmeat piled on the top. My husband felt there was a 1/4 pound of crab meat on that thing. The food felt and tasted very fresh, too. Again, this spot was great. I tried to drop subtle hints to go back tonight but the husband wasn't having it. Maybe I'll try again tomorrow or the next day, or the next day.....

Review Text :
Nevada Chicken Café catered my companys Christmas Party and man did they bring a TON of food.They do Chicken-rotissere-grilled chicken-a little dry compared to El Pollo Loco but good non the less.They also had ribs which were VERY tough & dry.Definitely would NOT do the ribs again.The side were a little bland & boring-mac-n-cheese,some orange looking rice and salads.They have great prices so it may be worth checking out again when its NOT catered but made to order.Right off the bat this place was annoying. The line doesn't start where it says it does, there was a 20 minute wait for chicken and a 30 minute wait for ribs. There was no ice and they were out of lemonade (I don't drink soda). The food was good but with the hassle of everything else I can't say it was worth it. The staff was kind of rude and stared a lot, which was very annoying.Yeah, I probably won't go back.

I like that they have pasta here and the meat is sliced right in front of your eyes if your into that sort of thing. Everything always looks really fresh even today at 4 pm. I have been coming here forever and will continue to do so.

Review Text :
Once upon a time I was a huge fan of this Baja Fresh location.  My coworkers and I  use to come here all the time for lunch.  Then, about 4 yrs ago I noticed a rapid decline in their food quality.  Their Chips started to become thinner and not so fresh.  Their Beef didn't taste as good.  And when they started posting nutritional info online.....I was afraid, very afraid.    Most of my favorite dishes here had a gazillion calories!  Oh no!Well, every once in a while I'll visit an old friend and have a Beef Burrito.  Was at this location recently and enjoyed one for lunch.  Nothing special though.Will I return?  Possibly.

All I want is for this place to do well.  It deserves it.Basically, if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs, you'll enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center.  And by speakeasy, I don't mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners, I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies--the best kind of speakeasy. :)The decor is eclectic and homemmade.  It basically looks like a co-op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters: hipsters, professors, crunchy folk, punkers, and any person who likes great food.I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today--Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage.  Otherwise, you should enjoy.Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it.  Good call. :)One note, they only take cash, much like the Y-Thai.  But really, if you're eating on campus, you should spend your money on places like Y-Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless, corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown.And there's free wifi.  Hot damn.

Review Text :
Saredella's Ultimate.  Memories of a time gone by.Back in the late eighties, my high school friends and I would hold regular Thursday evening get togethers to watch Married With Children and The Simpsons on the fledgeling Fox network....and we always ordered a Sardella's Ultimate:Large Cheese Pizza and 50 wings for 11.99 (back then).Oh sure, they still sell pizza, and they stil sell wings, but over the years they've gone from a super fresh neighborhood REAL pizza parlor (this is THE original location) to a generic, uneven quality "local-chain" of pizza stores. No fancy ingredients: the last time I tried to get a Hawaiian style, they had no Canadian bacon, only ham, not as slices, but tiny diced bits with a yucky flavor, and just as oily as pepporoni would have been, anyway.  No artichoke or banana peppers or anything like that either.On the positive, they do have cheap deals, and are regular sponsors of local kids' sports teams and other community stuff.  I remember getting a coupon for a free medium pizza when I moved into my house.I wish the Sardella's family continued success, but hope that someone within recognizes that their restaurants just aren't what they used to be.2.5 for the pizza 3.5 for the wings 5 for the way it used to be... Let me take you back to 1988 on the corner of 19th Ave and Union Hills Rd. There was a Safeway, Walgreen's and Sardellas. They were the new kids to the hood. My wonderful Momz and I were next door getting some useless crap from Walgreen's and the hunger hit. Momz always liked a good pizza. We walk into a tiny 1 suite pad and ask for 2 slices of pizza. Mr Sardella (totally Broken English and all) said " I'll-a give-a you-a a whole pie-a if ya tell-a me what-you think-a" Momz was no dummy she raised 4 kids, pizza never went to waste. We get the whole pie and man was it chewy... no flavor and meh. She tells the guy and he starts yelling and hitting David Sardella, " I tol-a you, you touch it too much-a" It was the funniest thing ever. Momz ordered pizza from them for over 7 year EVERY Friday for Daycare and several more times a month for dinners. My wife ordered from there for almost 10 years EVERY Friday and for huge get togethers we would order Sardellas. BUT ALAS.... The pizza got stingy, no great flavor, no great appeal. In fact they are now serving Deer Vally School's the lunches on Monday Wed and Friday. Sardellas has become "school lunch" boo Go get a Garlic cheese bread and some wings but skip the pizza. They do serve the Deer Valley Schools well, always giving money or hosting events, and I thank them for continuing to give back to the community.

Sammy's Deli looks like a simple, unassuming burger joint more than a deli. It's the kind of place that you drive by a few times, look at the quaint exterior and sign and pass because you already know of a great burger place that you can count on. One rainy day while I got my oil changed at nearby Meineke, I decided to give Sammy's a try.The menu is reasonably priced, ranging from your typical burgers, sandwiches and salads from basic to the ones with lots of fixin's. The interior isn't very notable. Order up at the register, walk by their open kitchen, and take a seat at one of the vinyl booths with a formica table.   Los Angeles would snap up this authentic old cafe style restaurant and throw in some new modern light fixtures, fill in a cool color scheme to make it less sterile, and hire lots of hot waiters and waitresses. But, Sammy's keeps it real. What you see is what you get, no pretension. It was busy, but no long lines, just a few tables of fireman and local folks. My cheeseburger was surprisingly pretty good. Well-cooked, well-seasoned, a soft bun and pretty satisfying. Fries were also good. One of the cook's (possibly an owner) came out and asked how we liked things. He was very friendly and not overbearing. We traded tips on nixing computer viruses and spyware.  Sammy's food is solid and is a good alternative to the beaten path joints.

I'm surprised that this place isn't more packed.If it was in SF - it would be poppin'.Shootz has everything you could want in a local hangout spot. It's big. Huge actually. It has an eccentric lamp in the shape of a woman wearing all black. It has cheap drink specials. It has guest radio and local DJ's bumping out good stuff all night. It serves up food. It hosts Karaoke and poker nights. And it's a quality pool hall ( minus the plethora of broken cues - you'll find everywhere)The nice thing about Shootz is that it's never too busy.There's a consistent crowd of regulars who like to shoot their pool and hang out - but you can nearly always score a table, and can always count on a diverse group of people to be there.There's something extremely heart-warming to me about walking into a pool hall, while Mariah Carey spins from the DJ table, and there are two girls sporting their Uggs, as they argue about the best angle to hit the 8 ball in.

So I walk into Shomars and observe that there are two registers with two opposite personalities. In one register, jolly man. Behind the other register, grumpy man. As fate would have it, my order was taken by grumpy man. He was in a hurry, barking inquiries. It's fascinating because I think he might be one of the owners. "No Hummus!" he barked at my question. Got it! Moving right along. The no hummus retort made me think the gyros might be boring, so I went with the All-American Pita Burger. The Pita Burger was a delightful choice, served in pita bread with three thin patties, yellow-American cheese, lettuce and tomato. It hit the spot and is pretty unique to me. First All-American Pita Burger I've had at least. I'm craving one just writing about it!Anyway--check Mr. Grumpy's out!

What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. The seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D

Cute little diner hidden on a curve between lower and upper Lawrenceville. We came here for Sunday brunch, craving some delicious breakfast food.  I think I almost had a heart attack at how CHEAP it was.  For barely $4 you get eggs, a choice of meat and toast.  I mean, seriously!I actually opted for the Country Omelet, which was ham and provolone cheese, onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was an packed omelet with a crap ton of cheese!  It had to be like 3 or 4 slices!  It also came with home fries and wheat toast.  The home fries were okay, but I like crispier slices than what I got.  The service was extremely friendly.  Seriously went out of their way to check on you, get things for you and just be plain nice!  It is incredibly appreciated.I discovered no paper towels in the the bathroom and told the server.  She whispered to me that they don't keep paper towels in the bathroom anymore, but at the front counter.  Apparently people were stuffing them in the toilet.  Um, whoever is doing that, stop it!  I want paper towels in the bathroom!Hot Tip: They DO accept credit cardsIn the summer it looks like they have a super cute patio to sit out on!

Awesome neighborhood place! After scoping out possible places to dine in this area on yelp we settled on La Pinata because of the promising reviews about their stellar enchiladas! Never one to miss up on a good enchilada, we gave it a go and were very happy!!The salsa was good, as were the chips, they kept 'em coming! I especially loved the lady with the salsa in a pitcher who wandered around the dining room giving our lil bowl refills on the regular! The tacos were awesome and so were the enchiladas!! YES! The food was fantastic, our only complaint was that the service was shit. We had this guy as our waiter, sorry didn't catch his name but he was ignoring us like CRAZY! We'd call for him, he'd give us the errect index finger asking for a minute and would never come! We didn't get refills on our sodas, until we asked for them from the salsa chick! Other tables that were seated after we arrived got their food before us and were out the door before us because he kept forgetting to bring us our check! We weren't especially rude, but after being fed up, I asked him if he was slammed that day. I knew he wasn't because there were three servers and about 12 tables filled, that's around 4 tables each and most of his other tables were just drinking and hanging out. He said no, and I asked then why are you ignoring us? No apology, nothing. He just laughed and walked away and kept on ignoring us. We tipped the salsa chick, paid and then left!The food is AWESOME! don't get me wrong... but the service is reeeeally awful. Or atleast this guy was. The other servers seemed to be doing a better job. To my yelpers, I say: if you want good neighborhood mexican, go here. That is, If you have a lot of time on your hands and are very patient with crappy service. If you have neither of these things, then don't fret - there are PLENTY of other places nearby!All hail the Arizona cheese crisp and this instituation that has been around since 1970 still makes a great one.This most recent trip to Phoenix for the Jewish New Year left me longing to visit my Grandfather's grave along with my Great Aunt Florence and my Great Uncle Marshall. In order to go to the cemetery, we have to go through what is now a "sketchy part of town" but a part that I used to be more familiar with when I was younger. Since we were going on our way to the airport, I suggested to my Mom that we go to LP for lunch so I could get my cheese crisp fix and see if my childhood memories of this place lived up. The Synagogue I grew up going to was close to LP. La Pinata was the first "real" Mexican food restaurant I ate at and the only one my Grandparent's would go to since they never really cared for Mexican food but did like cheese crisps and chimichangas. My Great Uncle had his 50th birthday party here in 1976 and I was there. Yes, there is history. Most importantly, when we arrived around 2pm on Saturday afternoon, there were mostly empty tables and the decor was the same as I remembered it. Our waiter was super nice, we ordered the cheese crisp and it came out crispy, and piping hot. For those of you who don't know what a cheese crisp is, imagine a giant tortilla topped with cheese then baked or put under a broiler for a few minutes and sliced in triangles like a pizza. It is awesome and something I make at home but it is not quite the same. My mom ordered a spinach enchilada a la carte, I had a side of refried (lardy kind) beans and rice and the daughter had the lunch portion of steak fajitas (huge portion). Lunch menu is available M-Sat which is a very nice thing to know. Is this the best Mexican food ever? No. Did the taste and my memory hold up? Yes. Will I be back-DEFINITELY! Thank you La Pinata for being at least one thing that hasn't changed in Phoenix...

If I say it wasn't as bad as I was expecting is that good?  2.5 stars.I have only eaten at a JB's once.  That was in Price, UT probably 3 or 4 years ago.  It was memorably bad.  So when I offered to pick up lunch for an employee and they picked this place I was expecting the worst.  I went in with diminished expectations.I played it safe with a BLT, fries and a shake.  It was OK!  Yay!  The BLT was actually almost....well...pretty good.  Hey that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!

Review Text :
I moved very near this restaurant about a year and a half ago.  The first time we tried it, we loved it enough to keep going back several times.  The food was delicious and original -- not what you get at a typical generic americanized mexican restaurant.  The place has really gone down hill a lot in a short time.The latest time we went will also probably be the last time we go.  The food simply stank.  Everything came with a pile of hard purple cabbage, which unlike the typical but useful pile of lettuce&tomatoes, was nothing more than garnish.  (this cabbage can be seen in just about all of the photos others have posted)  Dishes that had been consistently good over several visits were suddenly changed, and not for the better.  My daughter's shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it used to be, and if she's going to order something that costs more than what I order, It'd better be worth it, dammit!I know Parrilla Suiza has long been considered agreat place, and not your typical mexican restaurant, but it just isn't the case anymore.  I am curious if any other former long-time customers are recently feeling the same?I've been to this La Parrila Suiza a couple of times now. I keep getting invited by some friends to join them in this Mexico City food fest.  They love this place so I've hesitant in writing this review but after our last meal I feel I must "spill the beans"...Service ~ They are really friendly and helpful when ordering but they are very slow. I mean, come on!  You can only play "eye spy" so many times before you loose interest in why your there to begin with.  The only... and I mean only reason we did not leave was due to their tri-salsa dippage action with crispy chips.  It is really one salsa a pico de gallo and a green creamy kinda of dipFood ~ Chicken flautas were ok, three of them fried, topped with sour cream and Piquillo sauce served with rice, guacamole cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw and beans were not goo at all.  We also had the Chicken Melt which was very good but we were shorted one of the tortillas!  It was supposed to be two flour tortillas filled with melted cheese, chicken bacon, avocado and tomatoes, topped with cheese and a sauce. It also came with their beans rice and cole slaw.  It took so long to get our order we didn't bother saying anything...Our last order was a chicken taco salad.  It was HUGE and served in a very crisp tortillas bowl.  The salad was tossed with all of the ingredients which was different.  I enjoy separating some of the chicken, cheese and other goodies in the salad bowl, but with this salad you could not do that ~ it was all tossed together.  The chicken was very cold and tasted blah. The bland dressing was also tossed into the salad which made this thing a big bowl of mushy lettuce, yuk-a-roo.So if your meeting a friend and they are buying this might be a good place for you to go.

Restaurant name  Pullano's Pizza & Wings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Having recently moved to the neighborhood, I'm on the prowl for a new pizza place. I was looking for one that delivered, but Pullano's is close enough for pick up, and I read good things about it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.I probably should have stuck with pizza. But we were in the mood for a full, homestyle meal. We ordered a veal parmesan, a chicken parmensan, two wedding soups, and a burger for the kid. The fact that they had burgers should have been a minor warning sign. The fact that they also have a full Mexican food menu should have been a great big honkin' neon sign.Like most places in the Valley, Pullano's is tucked in a shabby strip mall. Inside, it's very cheery and friendly. The walls are chocked full of sports memorabilia from the local teams they support, as well as some knickknacks, and TVs airing sports. It's been around a while, and that made it rather comfortable and neighborhoody.The staff was all smiles, and after a short wait, had my food ready to go. The price for our meal was around $30. Not bad.Once I got it home and unwrapped it, well, yeah. The veal parm was one of those chopped and re-formed patties, dowsed in a bland tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella. The chicken was an actual chicken breast, served in the same way, but had the texture of a dog's chew toy (not that I've actually tried one.)On a bright note, the italian wedding soup was really rather good. In fact, we have toyed with the idea of ordering from Pullano's again -- but just soup and garlic bread. Or maybe a pizza.Let's call a spade a spade; there's really not that much that separates Pullano's from any of its competition, of which there is plenty. There's a Hungry Howie's down 51st street, a Ballpark Pizza on Thunderbird, Pizza by Napoli in the opposite direction on T-bird, and a Domino's practically across the street. They all make pizza. They all make hot wings. They will all make your intestines hate you.What sets Pullano's apart from the others is the atmosphere. Pullano's is a fun place to be. There are giant TVs all over the place, blaring whatever sporting event is going on. The walls are covered with team paraphernalia and the occasionally offensive but amusing show of patriotism (like a picture of an F-16 with a guy on a magic carpet shopped in).Pullano's is the perfect place to bring large groups of people. The staff  seems to even prefer the larger groups, probably because they tip better. The menu has lots of specials that cater to large tables. Depending on the day, you can get two for one pizza deals or a large with 30 wings. The wings are a little on the crispy side, but you never get the wimpy little "mini wings" that places like Buffalo Wild Wings or Domino's try to screw you with when you order large batches. The pizza's chock full of grease, but it's filling and tastes pretty damn good. I recommend the Chicken Alfredo pizza if you ever get a chance. On Wednesdays it's two for one, last I checked.I'm sure there's other stuff on the menu, but I wouldn't bother. It's a pizza place. There's a reason why nobody buys tacos at Burger King.This pizza place reminds me of my childhood in the burbs of Chi-town. It's a warm and friendly place to be with multiple TVs blaring the current football game, patrons and fans cheering with every touchdown and piping hot pizza right from the oven! They even have 2-4-1 meal nights! This is the place for your pitcher of bud and your favorite team jersey, Oh, and don't worry, no need to dress up or find yourself a baby sitter.

I visited Ishi tonight with some fellow yelpers (Megan P., BJ S, and Sam P) tonight and I was pleasantly surprised with the selection even if the inside was a bit grungy :) .  Our waitress was great - she had some awesome recommendations and I was very very pleased with her suggestions. I was barely able to eat the two rolls I ordered there was so much food and the display was very aesthetically pleasing!  I'd honestly rate this as a 3.5 experience, but because the service was great, I bumped it to 4.   If you are in the university area and want a low key sushi place, I'd recommend swinging by.3.49 stars it is. They seemed to have a pretty big sushi selection. However, not being much of a sushi lover, they had a good selection of hibachi entrees to choose from. i was content with the cost of my Ishi Shrimp selection ($7.25 plus 50 cents to add zucchini). The portion size was exactly right as I cleaned my plate and left with a full belly. Not to mention, it was solidly delicious.I did try one of Mrs. P's sushi and i could barely get it all in my mouth, it was ginormous (twss). It wasn't too shabby tasting. The interior of Ishi was kind of an ishi (as in issue...anyone? ...mrs. p?), although I was amused with the look of the sushi bar area (like a thatch roof Tiki vibe going on). The place actually had the appearance of a former Mexican restaurant and would probably not be the sushi place you go to impress a date. However, i thought our service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly, helpful with suggestions and they were always on top of our water refills. We even got a fancified orange at the end of the meal and  mints with the check.. We do not venture to this area often enough to likely make a return trip but it was a very satisfying dinner.Beer drinker note: Bud light, Miller Lite, Coors  $2.00Sam Adams bottle, Blue Moon  $2.50Heineken, Corona $2.75Sapporo, Kirin $3.00

This was my first time ever eating at this location.So many other good buffets that are a lot better than this one.Several different stations of different food stations throughout the buffet area.I would have to say that the only thing I really enjoyed was the craving station.The had a Tri-Tip steak and it was delicious,along with some mashed potatoes and gravy and a corn on the cob.The salad bar was in two different area's of the Buffet.Fresh fruit on side and the other side had all the condiments for your salad on the other side.The desert station was in the middle and their where a lot of different desert's.My favorite where the cupcakes and the carrot cake.The Buffet came with all you can eat and your choice of beverage.Alcohol was an additional cost The Buffet cost $19.95 per person and if you had a rewards card from Stratosphere and enough points you could receive 25 percent off.The employees that are working the floor where very nice and very attentive.

Yep another chain and though I have eaten at many OG's over the years, have never been a huge fan. Had lunch here on a Thursday with Gma, mom, and daughter towards the late side of the lunching hour. For some reason, there was a wait, and the dining room was crowded. Long story short, 2 of us returned our meals as they were nasty. Breadsticks and salad are still good but unfilled iced tea, weird service, etc. makes this one chain we will never visit again while in the area.

Konichiwa LV yelpers!I'm always on a quest to find new japanese restaurants to add to my where to eat for dinner list.Thanks for all of the awesome yelp reviews on TJR! I finally got to try TJR a week ago with one of my gf.As for the food we order. We ordered the chicken teriyaki & tempura combo with the hawaiian and crunch roll. Food was delicious... along with the complimentary miso soup and edamame.Everything went well, except a comment our waitress made when I asked for more edemame. I mean really?! I don't think it's costing them a lot of money to fill our little bowl with more edemame. When I asked if we could have a little more, she commented back with, it's only for service... (meaning they don't give more then 1 serving) I've been to other restaurants who never had a problem giving me a refill... just saying.Dinner for 2 cost us around $40 not including tip.Indoor seating. Located in an old building in an off the strip area. Nothing fancy, whole in a wall type of place with authentic japanese food. I did get lost for a split minute trying to look for then hidden gem... look for their blue sign. There was no wait on Saturday night around 8pm and the restaurant was surprisingly on the empty side.First place I've stumbled upon in Vegas where the waitress was dressed in kimonos. Love sitting in the wooden booth... very japanesezy,I would love to come back here again to try more... despite our rude waitress...Great place to come with friends, date or family night.If you're looking for a japanese spot off the strip... stop by TJR.I'll be back to explore my options and ask for a refill on edamame! arigato.Party of five, six rolls, veggie tempura, miso soup for all, and three big Sapparo beers ended up being $20 per person. Not bad! We sat in a long booth and it wasn't crowded at all on a Saturday night. Friendly service. I believe they are Korean owned.I recommend what we had:Mexican roll (SO SPICY!)Hawaiian roll Popcorn roll (LOBSTER)Crunch rollPhilly rollThis place was recommended by a Vegas native who is well-traveled so I trusted he knew what good sushi rolls were like. We spent about 20 minutes trying to look for this place. It's behind all the buildings, in a building in the middle of the lot. Plenty of parking.Visited Tokyo a few weeks ago when meeting up with a friend for lunch.  I'd suggested Komol for that heavenly herbal salad, but the friend wanted to try Tokyo instead.  I almost bailed but decided I'd go to Tokyo with him, and if I wasn't impressed I'd simply call Komol for an herbal salad to go.That wasn't necessary.On the outside I saw a big sign advertising their all you can eat prices.  I don't recall exactly what it was, but it seemed pretty standard pricing for a lunch AYCE ($21 or so).  I'll be honest, I don't really enjoy going to sushi restaurants unless I order AYCE.  It just bothers me to order rolls for $8-$12 a piece when I'm so used to the comfort of ordering and ordering and ordering and ordering knowing I'm paying one set price.  There's too much to choose from that I want to eat, that my brain can't handle having to pick and choose a few select items.  That being said, I treated myself to a more expensive lunch than I'm used to, to fully allow myself to enjoy the experience.I could never accurately describe everything I ate, but I must say I enjoyed nearly each and every item.  My order consisted of a handful of rolls, 3-4 orders of nigiri, and some side items like miso soup, gyoza, and a small piece of salmon teriyaki.  All of the fish tasted fresh and the side items were prepared as I'm used to at my favorite AYCE places like Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway with the exception of maybe the salmon teriyaki which seemed overcooked to me.So give Tokyo a visit if you're into AYCE sushi, and if you don't like it as much as I did, remember you always have Komol next door.Same name, same bat channel, and still serving fresh seafood, but now with the AYCE lunch ($21.95, 11:45am to 3pm) and dinner ($26.95 and starts at 3pm) options. It really is a no brainer to head over here for some Japanese cuisine if you are in the neighborhood.  The sushi chefs that were working tonight are not the A-crew (death in the family prevented the boss from being there this week), but the food prepared and served looked wonderful and tasted great.Highlights of the dinner AYCE (typically not served elsewhere or items worthy of a special shout out):6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore, white fish)6 pieces of spicy sashimiUni Shooter (usually not on the AYCE menu; packs a little heat)Korean B.B.Q. Ribs - operated by Koreans,so they know their kalbi.Fresh Scallop (Hotategai) - can't be torched, but it was very good.Fresh OysterMushroom Yaki (Grilled King Oyster Mushroom with Butter)I ordered most of my usual sushi and special requested some hand roll (temaki), that the sushi chefs were able to accommodate without missing a beat.Service was good.  The waitstaff cleared away the used plates and refilled the beverage without prompting.Would I recommend this restaurant? You betcha!4 stars.Ladies and Gentlement, Start Your Engines!  You have 90 minutes to eat at the Tokyo Japanese Restaurant AYCE menu!  Ready-Set-Go!!!My cousins were in town from Hawaii and we all wanted to get some Japanese food, but didn't want to fight the crowds at the large popular hotel chains.  Tokyo Restaurant is located about 1-2 miles off the main strip. First thing you need to know is that this restaurant is more home-style cooking. Restaurant owner, Becky, was a nice but a firm Korean lady.  She has owned the restaurant for 9 years.    I ordered the AYCE Dinner ($26.95) and was given a 90 minute time limit on my meal.  No problem.   All dishes are mini tapa-style plates, and the sushi orders are about 1/2 size of what is normally given in regular sushi bars.  Fun, as you can try many different things with plates this size.  Eat, to the pumping sounds of ABBA playing in the background.Sashimi Plate:  A combination of hamachi, maguro, salmon, tai snapper, and several other fishes.  This was probably the highlight of my meal.  Nice fish and beautifully presented.

Everyone is welcomed.  One of the female patrons sitting at the sushi bar stood up and shouted.  Then she went around the sushi bar and ended up head-butting her head on the glass counter.   This caused 7-8 glasses of Sake-Beer shooter glasses (*prepared by the sushi chef) to foam immensely.  Everyone at the bar, including the sushi chefs, yelled GAMBATTE and everyone grabbed a glass and shot the sake-beer drink.  Lady - I hope your head is OK as that was a pretty big bang on the sushi bar.  Impressive!Food Grade:  B / B+Service Grade:  A-  (Thanks, Aaron!)Worth the money Grade:  B+Overall Impression:

Restaurant name  The Roasting Company

Review Text :
In the couple of years since I last visited, the Roasting Company has added a "taproom" area where they have table service AND BEER. I had no idea!The chicken is still absolutely great. Moist and tasty. I'd recommend the chicken and black bean con queso. Or one of the chicken pot pies if they haven't sold out. Add a scoop of salsa (mild, hot or very hot) from their salsa bar.Other than the beer menu (and spirits too), there is a Coke fountain and urns of sweet/unsweet tea.While planning my trip I was checking out many of my old favorites, some are gone, many are still flourishing like the Roasting Company. I lived in the neighborhood and would eat here regularly like 2-3 times a week. Imagine my surprise to find they had finally opened the place up and added a full bar and doubled the size of the menu, all to the betterment of their devoted customers.I was all smiles when I saw that my all time favorite "smoked cheese pasta salad" was still featured, I got an extra order to take back to the hotel. The rotisserie chicken is still the star here, crispy on the outside, juicy and luscious in the inside. All the sides are great, there are 18 to choose from, something for everybody. Free refills, that beautiful classic salsa bar, and and endless supply of hot sauce and their special Tico sauce. The service is always fast, the food is consistently great, I never understood why these guys haven't expanded beyond Montford Drive because this business would thrive anywhere. Also a great place to watch a ballgame now since the expansion. Got a really nice vibe now.BTW, I was amused at some of the negative reviews. Are you people insane? And BTW, occasionally Yelp does listen cause I flagged one review that raved about the food, but gave the restaurant one star because she had to "refill my own tea" so if you see any of your favorite places being abused like this please flag away, you never know.

Review Text :
Holy Brunch Buffet Batman!There's a difference between a place that has one long table of buffet choices that's mass produced and more than likely been sitting out for most of the morning and the Grand Concourse.  The Grand Concourse is just that, GRAND!The Grand Concourse may have that one long table of buffet foods that have possibly been touched by little kid sticky hands BUT they have "create your own" food stands!  Any place that offers me the chance to pile on the most scrumptious and fattening food toppings is a winner in my book!  Stop by the make your own omelet or pancake or waffle or ICE CREAM SUNDAE (can you tell how excited I am about that) bar for your own sinful creation.  And the place itself....just breathtaking!  You don't come across many places like this anymore.  It used to be the main train station into downtown Pittsburgh and they've really done a fantastic job making it look as it did back in the day.  I swear to god I always want to act out the scene in the Titanic where they're all sitting around the main dining room together talking all proper.  But then I remember I'm shoveling 30 pounds worth of pancakes in my mouth and that vision quickly dissolves!*Remember if you want to go for brunch make a reservation!  Bon voyage on your eating adventure!I had fun, it's a beautiful place.  The service was really good and I love buffet dining.  Here's the thing.  The food ranged from bad to just ok.  I am there for the food.  There are a couple reviews about this restaurant that exclaim that it's the best buffet ever.  I should have really ignored them and focused on all the more critical reviews on this restaurant as they really rang true.  Normally when the reviews are this mixed I stay far away.  I don't know where to begin.  How about the omelet station.  It takes a tremendous amount of skill to make a good omelet on a flat top.  It just isn't done this way.  You have to spread out a lot of egg and quickly fold it onto itself to give it any depth.  If you leave it flat, it's done before you can warm any ingredients or melt any cheese.  I watched rubbery brown thin wrappers of egg surround cold and bland ingredients flow from a well meaning omelet station attendant.  How could you? I didn't realize it until later but if you're looking for the french toast, it's hidden in back of the omelet station in a hotel pan.  I never did find it until we were on our way out the door.  The best 2 things about this brunch were the automatic donut machine and the bagels.  Neither of which this place makes on their own.  In fact, I noted quite a few things they don't actually prepare here at all.  The meat carving station looked nice and I chose the Gobi Dessert of pork loins.  It isn't 1950 and you don't have to cook pork within an inch of it's life anymore.  There wasn't anyone in the kitchen today that knows how lean a cut this is and how if you're going to put it out on a carving station it should be cooked til slightly pink in the center. The desert station isn't worth my time to talk about.  There isn't a real pastry chef there and the cookies were clearly out of a box.  The chocolate cake tasted like Duncan Hines with the frosting that you get out of a can.  Another sad and depressing effort here in the Burgh.  Sigh.

Review Text :
I worked with a chef, calamari was his favorite cuss word, he would be dead serious and yelling in his Italian accent, "ohh calamari!""Oh, calamari!" was what I wanted to yell when I ate at Toscana, it is a true Italian restaurant, not a wanna be, down to the tall, dark, European waiters.  This restaurant is a hidden little gem in the Specialty Shops at the Park (gag, what a lame name for shops.)  I ordered linguini with shrimp, calamari, clams, mussels & cherry tomatoes.  Pretty tasty and for $13, not a bad deal for a pasta dish enough for two and loaded with seafood.My lunch partner in crime had rigatoni with sausage & peas in a tomato cream sauce. You can't go wrong with anything with heavy cream added!They have a small express lunch menu for $13, including soup or salad, lunch special and a tea/soda. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon.

Restaurant name  Amlee Chinese Cuisine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared "family style" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.I finally found a place to get great Chinese food. I noticed some other reviews mentioned this place being too pricey. I don't get that it does say gourmet on the sign out front. Sure the inside is completely dated but it still has class and the owner herself comes to the table to serve each plate. She even prepared the salad we ordered fresh in front of us. The food isn't greasy in anyway which id w hat I find at most places I have been too. The portion of food you get for the price is very good. I would suggest because if the portion sizes that you either plan on sharing with your table or taking leftovers home. Nothing like cold Chinese food for lunch the next day! I ordered Szechuan Beef and could have easily eaten the whole dish if I weren't sharing with others because it was that good. The meat was tender and very good. I rarely eat rabbit food but I did think it was cool how it was prepared right in front of us. The vegetable fried rice tasted perfect. My wife thought it could use more flavor but she also likes soy sauce on it so whatever. The service is really awesome here and i left full and satisfied. Coming back for sure. Call ahead and order take out if you don't want to dine inside.3.5 STARS: Good  Money talks. When I  spend money I talk about it on Yelp. In the next few paragraphs I will talk about my lunch in Amlee Chinese Cuisine.  In recent times I have been trying out the different Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. After visiting Amy's Hallmark, I decided to try Amlee Chinese Cuisine near my house.  Amlee Chinese Cuisine is located in a small strip mall at the southeast corner of Sunset and Sandhill Roads. From what I read, Amlee Chinese Cuisine has been standing in this exact spot for thirty years. It has been thirty years of family ownership. When a restaurant is in business for thirty years, they rise above it all. In 2003, Amlee Chinese Cuisine rised above it all when the Best of Las Vegas voted it the best Chinese Restaurant in 2003 (www.usmenuguide.com/amleegourmet.htm).   When I walked inside Amlee Chinese Cuisine at lunchtime, I saw a bar to my right and a spacious dining room to the left. The tables were large and nearly empty at this visit.   The personable waitress led me to a table in this comfortable dining room. Soon, she poured the water into a clean glass. Nonetheless I ordered a Coke with my lunch. This is the first Chinese Restaurant that has ever served me Coke from Mexico. So, it was a cosmopolitan lunch with Mexican Coke and Chinese food.   The luncheon special attracted me to Amlee Chinese Cuisine. As my fellow Yelpers have stated, the prices here are higher. I can't support the argument that you get what you pay for when I had food of equivalent taste and quality for the same price recently at dinner in China Bistro, NY Chinese Restaurant, and China Tango Bistro. The lunch specials range between $7.95 and $10.95. They include an entre, soup of the day that is expectedly the omnipresent egg drop soup, egg roll, and choice of fried or white rice. For $1.50 extra, they will substitute the soup of the day with wonton soup. With a Coke from Mexico, wonton soup, and tip my lunch special added up to around $17.50.  I ordered the shrimp chow mein. The personable waitress stated that this is one of her favorites. In my opinion, the wonton soup was my favorite. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and not get tired of it. Maybe that's because wonton soup is in my Top 25 Favorite Foods List. The fried rice was a lighter color than I was used to. However, it was delicious. The noodle based shrimp chow mein was also delicious. I appreciated all the vegetables that tasted like onion and cabage mixed in. On the other hand I would of appreciated more than four shrimp. Come to think of it, I would of appreciated it if the meal included crunchy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard.   I have done enough talking about Amlee Chinese Cuisine. In my opinion that is based on experiences dining in Chinese Restaurants, Amlee is a good Chinese Restaurant that I anticipate serving the Las Vegas community in the decades ahead.

This is a little tiny hole in the wall to-go cheap Chinese place but they have enough space for a few dine-in tables.  Is it anything fancy?? NO.  But it sure is cheap and solid.  Where else can you find a lunch special for $4.50 with rice and egg roll (I personally like spring roll better)?  The portion isn't big, so I feel bad for eating the whole darn order in record time since I normally split my food into 2 meals to justify all the craps I eat.  But a girl gotta do what a girl gotta do to fill her belly.  Just FYI, when I eat with my parents here, we actually order a little more authetic Chinese... like Ma Po Tofu and salt & pepper spare ribs, and they are actually really good.  If you don't speak Chinese (assuming that you don't), I wonder if you can still ask for it.

Restaurant name  Gus's SIR Beef Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It breaks my little heart to rate Gus's Sir Beef two stars - especially since the staff are very sweet and down to earth. But alas, my meal and overall impression of the place was sub par at best.The place: It's an establishment. Gus's has been around for some time and it shows. It's an old school Southern diner esque, classic meat & three, etc. And that's completely fine by me, but the building is showing some major wear and the menus are a bit crusty and food laden. You only get one chance to make a first impression...The staff: As mentioned, everyone here is kind and sweet. The kind of place where the server calls you "hun" and probably has for 30 years. The food: Just not bueno for me. On Gus's menu, he purports that he uses only farm fresh veggies from his actual farm. Well, it didn't look like it in my "crisp" salad. My bowl of greens looked, and tasted, straight out of a mixed greens bag. And the lettuce was swimming in cool water with a touch of dressing. For my main lunch course I chose the cheese ravioli which came out crusted and baked with oodles of plastic-y cheese. The sauce tasted canned and the ravioli were essentially tasteless. Needless to say, I left Gus's Sir Beef hungry and disappointed. I really wanted to like this classic lunch spot, but it fell very short of a winner for me.

Let me start off by saying they failed my french fry barometer test. Very sad. You know this makes me mad, good thing I'm not the Incredible Hulk or  I would be flippin' tables and takin' names.I was with my parents so we pigged out (pun, not intended) . Everything was lukewarm,  fried squash, broccoli casserole, french fries, baked beans and my bbq sandwich. It was fine and our server was very charming.  Sweet tea was average.  I wouldn't write it off, but I would't make a special trip to return.

Restaurant name  Courier Cafe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I would have given Courier Cafe five stars after having had a wonderful lunch last week and having had a delightful milkshake there this evening, if not for a horrifying experience today.I came with three other new history grad students.  And we were delighted, ever so delighted with the milkshakes.  They were creamy and wonderful, and, thinking of how much I enjoyed my lunch (pesto chicken pita) last week, I knew I'd have a great night.  We joked and laughed, and we found ourselves finally feeling at ease in our new Midwestern home.Until the owner/manager, a cranky older man walked up and said, "You need to keep down.  People are complaining about your noise all throughout the restaurant."Um, WTF?  We had laughed loudly, yes, but it was 9pm in a college town.  It wasn't that horrible.  We weren't saying anything inappropriate, and it wasn't overblown.  We were given our checks--basically thrown at us--very quickly, and we were basically 'encouraged' to leave.This ruined our awesome experience.  And it sucked.  And we were made to feel like crap for the last few minutes since we were there.  Then Jerky McAss then glared at us while we paid our bills.Thanks for treating us like crap, jerk.  We really liked this place, but I guess it's not something I'm looking forward to visiting now.We have been coming into the Courier Cafe for years,  and despite the very tasty "home-cooked" feel the meals at Courier Cafe have,  service has steadily deteriorated. It has never been so bad. The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food.-(Money-saving Mystery Butter blend) On numerous occasions when we dined here, we had a very hard time getting an order in. When ordering a plate, the waitress was cold and stern. We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving "mystery butter blend", and she was making a face and saying "Oh I'm not sure I can do that", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.-(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!-(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said "hi", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her "you have customers waiting for you, Nicole."But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile. -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a "Liar" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us "Disingenuous" for the same reason.-(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again.I'd pass if I were you.This 4-star bullshit is a reflection of Urbana's high tolerance for mediocrity.The sandwiches look like something a kindergartener would get at a daycare center with a side of fruit cocktail. Wonderbread with an anorexic serving of meat and a pickle spear for $8 or more.We had to get up and walk around to find an employee who would take our money. The couple next to us got up and left because nobody would take their order.Inexcusably bad service, inexplicably bad food. Come on, Urbana, for once, accept the fact that some businesses are meant to die. In case you don't get out much, the Courier Cafe is terrible. They are operating as if they have no competition.Suffering through a shit sandwich and bad service is a stupid way of supporting local business. Unless you're into self-punishment and leather and... you know, in that case, join the priesthood.On a sidestreet in downtown Urbanaa hidden gem sits, tucked awayBy word of mouth, all locals knowabout Courier CafeThe moment you walk through the dooryou're filled with small-town cheerThe atmosphere is "mom & pops"No wonder they've been here for yearsGigantic cookies as big as your headpastries and muffins are on displayNext to their vintage cash registerBeneath the glass counter where you payTheir menu is full of sundaes and shakesordered by children & adults alikeThey've got burgers, sandwiches and wrapsI haven't found something I didn't likeBy the way, for just 95 centsyou can pick a side with your mealSeasoned wedge fries or sweet potato chipsBut the dill potato salad's my idealIf you come, do so for brunchOr breakfast, lunch or dinnerAt any time of the day, just be preparedThat you won't leave here feeling thinnerWhich leads me to a related topicTheir hot fudge will make you swoon!"Would you like some ice cream with that fudge?"Nah, the fudge itself- plus me and a spoon.As a student, I had a morning ritual:Fresh coffee and a pastry.The croissant-crust with raspberry preservesMan, it's been years since I've had one lately...So, five stars are for nostalgiaand five stars are for the foodHopefully proof enough, that this place is the bomb:Using poetry to capture the moodThis place has made its markIt's a beloved Urbana spot of mineEvery time I come back to campusThis is hands-down where I'll dine

I must profess my love for Showmars. There aren't many businesses that deserve 5 stars, but Showmars is on point. Everything is good. Customer service, all of the food and without a doubt, the undisputed star of the show - the Fish Sandwich. I've ordered it over 2 dozen times and each bite is as still as good as the first. The English language and Roman Alphabet alone cannot describe the satisfaction and pure bliss that it brings me. I wish you all could hear me and see my facial expressions. That fish sandwich my friends, with tartar and coleslaw really is the world's greatest.

Review Text :
I'm a Madison native and have been to Jolly Bob's a few times. It's not a terrible place, but tonight as I was walking in I saw a long dress code. I thought it was a joke at first, because in addition to "no doo-rag", they said that no white shirts were allowed. I thought they couldn't be serious.That is, until I got turned away at the door. I'm a white guy, but I can recognize that policies like this are clearly racist. They're trying to keep out 'ghetto' guys and have ended up with a laughable dress code. I honestly felt like I was in the '50s and segregation was in full force - it was just a bizarre, sad experience, especially after living in Brazil for 3 years.Add to this the fact that as I stood there at the door trying to get my sister's attention, I saw a woman in a white shirt and pointed her out to the bouncer. "The code is only for men" he said. O.....K..... that makes a lot of sense.This is a racist policy that people shouldn't support. I'm definitely not going in there again - no matter what I'm wearing.

Review Text :
After eating at Wong's, you'll  hate yourself for having ever had Panda Express.The first thing you notice about Wong's is how misleading the outside is. It's wedged between a used book store and a bridal store and looks about as big as a taco truck. You get inside, however, and a large, superbly decorated dining room awaits you. I have never, in all the years I've gone to Wong's, waited for a table. Literally, I'm seated half a minute within entering. Even during the lunch rush, there's always room. Tea is provided, and between that and the water, you probably won't want to order a coke or anything. The tea takes some getting used to, but soon you won't be able to eat lo mein without it. And expect to get your water glass refilled like at least a dozen times. Literally, I've never actually finished a glass of water before it was refilled. The staff is so accommodating and hospitable, it's like eating in a family's dining room table. The service is so on par that out of the years I've been going, only one guy has ever complained about his food. Have you ever seen other patrons at a restaurant tell a complaining customer to STFU? Well, that's how awesome Wong's is. No joke.The food is, like, whoa. Personally I prefer the lunch specials, where you get the entree, fried rice, egg roll and soup for about the cost of a McMeal Deal. Dinner comes with a big pot of rice that you and your friends will never finish so don't even try.Foods I Recommend: Pork Lo Mein, Emperor's Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, and Chow Mein.The menu they offer is also super easy to understand, with clear cut descriptions of all the entrees, which is nice, because nothing irritates me more than a Chinese eatery that serves you soft noodles and calls it "chow mein".-The owner (man) was VERY friendly.-Some Chinese Woman (the owner's wife?)...NOT friendly! She gave me the impression that I was bothering her for coming in to eat there! There were like 3 or 4 other tables in the whole place.-The Food: Not so great...the chicken was mostly small almost chopped chicken chunks...dry too, maybe from overcooking?-Flavor: Ick! I didn't care for the food, thought it was bland.-Beef dish, not much beef...mostly veggies vs the meat ratio...$8.95. Not a good value.-I said "thank-you", as I left...the Chinese Woman looked at me and said nothing, then she walked away....nice!-Parking is convenient.-With the un-friendly Chinese Woman and not so great food, there are many other Chinese restaurants that I would select over Wongs.

I love love love Roadrunner Saloon!  Here's why:1. I love bar food, cowboy food, and Tex-Mex food.  Roadrunner Saloon carries all three of these types of food and they all taste great! I have tried a lot of the items and my belly is always happy afterwards.  Tasty food makes me happy.2. Dr. Pepper Tacos!  Yes, you heard me right!  I love Dr. Pepper just a smidgeon less than my hubby and kid, like a paper thin difference.  So when I heard about these tacos, I had to investigate.  They are super duper fantastic!  The soda makes the meat so tender and flavorful.   They are fun to eat and taste great. I know this goes with #1, but anything regarding Dr. Pepper gets a special spot in my book.3. Great service.  Every time I have been to this location, I have gotten great service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  I love good service because it makes your meal so much more enjoyable.  4. It's family friendly.  Many of my favorite bar food joints have switched to a 21 and over only, which means I rarely can go.  Sad.  Roadrunner does allow kids and families, so we can all go out to a good meal.  My daughter loves the place too because she is all about cowboy stuff already.5. The drinks are stiff!  If you are interested in bar service, the drinks are tasty.  I rarely have alcoholic drinks these days, but if you want one, Roadrunner serves stiff!The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that I think the prices are a bit high for what you get.  It isn't crazy over priced, just a $1 or so too high on most of the food items and $2-3 to high on the drinks.  Maybe I am just cheap in my old age, but that is how I see it.  I still love this place and will continue to go, I just wish it was a bit cheaper.

For 2 years I've been driving by @jimmyjohns. Today I stopped in.I am always hesitant of any place that has "Gourmet" in the name, that usually just means OVERPRICED.Right away you are greeted by everyone ready to take your order. Immediately you will notice a small menu board of ONLY cold lunchmeat sandwiches-no phillys,pizzas,etc.I ordered a #14-Roast beef & turkey on wheat. $7Don't get me wrong it was all fresh and a tasty lunchmeat sandwich but nothing to write home about. I'll keep driving by in the future.ps they DELIVER

If you are into beer, and I don't mean the fizzy yellow stuff, then you have to visit the Draft House!  Big dogs brews some of the best beer I've ever had.  It easily compares to Stone, Pizzaport, and is better than Dogfish Head.  Two particular beers that they brew, Alpha Dog (a double red ale, 8% abv), and War Dog (IPA, 8% abv) are just incredible beers!  Try the bullocks IPA, or the Dirty Dog IPA if those are not available.  The food is standard bar food, but with a higher quality than most bars in Las Vegas.  The Cheese Kurds are so awesome, and all of the sandwiches are really good too.  The fries are great, and the service is always top notch.  I am a big fan of Draft House, and a big fan of their beer.  Check out Beer School, and their other events with live music and special guest brews like Pizzaport and Stone.This is my "neighborhood bar"- the one I frequent when all else fails. Came mostly to try the seasonal War Dog IPA (hoppy meaness yet smooth= luvs!)I got one of their creations which you can make into a chicken sandwich, portobello mushroom sandwich, or burger (beef or boca). Grabbed The Roma Pesto (Delicious combination of homemade pesto, oven roasted tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon, and melted Mozzarella and Fontina cheese) with chicken and it was seriously good. Chicken was so juicy and definitely the best bar chicken sandwich I've had. Food has been bomb here and I'm not a American bar food kind of person either.Only miss was the pub cheese platter and that was one that was just "alright"...the cheese wasn't quite melted all the way. Everything else though has been fantastic.Next party I definitely want a grab a growler. Just for those not in the know- you buy this moonshine like jug and they'll fill it up with beer to take home! You can bring the jug back to refill it.Heard from @Dan P that they just tapped a batch of War Dog last Thursday....so I made sure I stopped by for lunch as soon as I came back to Vegas on Sunday.  Brought Mom's with me for our traditional Sunday lunch....we were staving and couldn't wait to get seated.  The Draft House is a Green Bay Packers Bar.....so it was packed with Packer Fans on the bar side....not one available seat or table.  It was 3 pm and the Packers vs Vikings game wasn't for another 2 hrs, but it was packed to the hilt!  We got seated in the dining room area, our server wes named Apple, seriously.After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we asked Apple if there were any specials....she proceeded to tell us about a bunch of Appetizer Specials ($2 off) and $2 off for the War Dog during the NFL Games, so we took her up on it.  We ordered:- 1/2 Order of Nachos $7.50- Bratwurst $3.50- Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels $5- NFL Hot Wings (10 Wings) w/Chipotle Sauce....their hottest Wing Sauce $6To wash it down, we both ordered Water and I of course ordered a 24 oz War Dog!  ($7.50, $5.50 with the special) The War Dog was freakin' awesome.....not as Hoppy as I expected based on @Dan P's report, but it was very good.After a short wait, we got our food....Nachos first.  Mom and I attacked those Nachos.  They were pretty good....topped with Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole, Olives, Jalapenos, Salsa, and Onions.Next up was the NFL Wings.....I jumped on those next....damn, they were awesome!  Very Meaty Wings.....the Chipotle Sauce was just right....had that Smoky flavor and was just Spicy enough for me and Mom.  The Ranch given to us for dipping went well with the Wings.They brought out my Bratwurst next.....I added some Mustard and Relish and went to town on it.  It came with grilled Onions topped on the Bratwurst.  It was pretty good....although the Bun wasn't all that.  I would have preferred a Roll or Italian Bread instead of a Hot Dog Bun.The last item to come out was the Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels.....they were piping hot and moist and doughy.....delish!  They came with a side of Nacho Cheese for dipping.It was at this point that Mom and I figured out that we ordered too much food.  I wasn't going to let this place defeat me though, so I pressed on.  Mom said she'd finish the Nachos and I would handle whatever was left of the Wings & Pretzels.We took our time watching the Seahawks vs Cardinals game and finished our food and Beer.When Apple delivered our check she said she made a mistake and gave us the food specials for Monday Night Football, not Sunday....but that the restaurant was going to honor the specials anyway because of the mistake....is that great service or what?Overall, great food & great service.Will I return?  You bet!We are here at least once a week. Today they made a mistake with my order. I wanted a portobello mushroom "burger" with cajun spice, blue cheese, red pepper. I got a boca burger. They were really cool about asking if I want a refire, but I was hungry and I don't mind Boca burgers, just I find most kitchens just kinda treat it like it needs to be heated and not "cooked"/seasoned like any other burger. The usual bartender even walked over and told me to take a bite and if it isn't what I want to get something else because "my happiness is important". He's always really cool and I do believe here that they sincerely mean it. Their mistake ended up being a good thing. The boca had cajun spice on it and was charred to crispy outside which was actually pretty nice. I ate all of it. Thought to talk about it so that in case there's some vegetarians out there- their portobello and boca burger options are good. I haven't talked about the sweet potato waffle fries yet....these are amazing- very light and crispy. They come with a beer mustard sauce that is lovely. Upgrade your regular side for the sweet potato, or get this as an app since it's great nosh with beer.Just a FYI theres a Winterfest 1-29-2011...sounds like a UYE. "25+ Beers.  Cajun Gumbo & Oyster Shooters.  3 Bands.  Raffles & More. 2-8 pm and After Party: 9 pm - ??"Yay! I'm a fan of Big Dog's...only if I'm in the area.At Big Dog's, the portions are just that, pretty big.  Service is always quick to be seated, order to be taken, and food to arrive. Can't give them 5 stars for service because at Big Dog's, they are not the most attentive group.  Once you get your meal, there are times you don't see or hear from a server until your check is given to you.  My suggestion is to do what I always do, order your drink refill early. As for the food, it's not bad and the portions are good.-Sliders: This was recommended on my very first visit about two years ago.  Priced about average (less than $10)' It's still delicious and taste about the same as other pub and grill joints.-Fish and Chips:  Deep fried and greasy.  Poke a couple of holes in the breaded fish and drain the greasy out first.  Now you're takin'.  Now it's at least edible.  I think the batter is a little too thick and takes away from the taste of the fish.-Steak:  Not a bad option, but it's a little dry.  However, it's cheap and you get what you pay for.-Pizza:  Has to be over 2 years since my last pizza here, but it's cheap and one of their better prepared items here.  For less than $10, a personal pizza here is tasty and not too greasy.-Burgers:  2nd favorite to their pizza.  Their burgers are stacked, juicy, and affordable. I never expect much at Big Dog's because the prices are cheap and it's basically pub food.  Portions are big and there's still enough on the menu for everybody.It's back at last!  After a long layoff, the best stroganoff in town has returned to the menu in the form of Old Fashioned Beef Stroganoff.  Featuring Choice-grade tender morsels of Top Sirloin beef, Crimini Mushrooms, and Pearl Onions combined with oodles of Egg Noodles and mixed together with burgundy in a piping hot Garlic Sour Cream Sauce, this is one delicious entree.  Precede this marvelous main with an order of Potstickers dunked in a spicy Asian dipping sauce and a Draft House Side Salad with a memorable light Honey Mustard Dressing, and a diner will have experienced one fine meal.Service here, too, was again fine and amiable, enjoying classic comfort food in a comfortable environment.  The only down note was the restaurant already being out of Cajun Seafood & Sausage Cajun Chowder by 9:30 p.m. when Diane and I arrived.4-1/2 stars overall!Potstickers are securely back on the menu.  So is Beef Stroganoff.  Now, if Big Dog's management is truly listening to customer demand, in order to create real comfort food nirvana it is time to also herald the daily return of the magnificent French Onion Soup previously served at the now shuttered Sahara Avenue Big Dog Cafe's location and since then offered only occasionally here as the soup of the day.Since my last re-review, I have been back to Big Dog's several times, and the level of consistency in food preparation and service are what keeps me coming back for more  late dinners there.  The last two times, after scarfing down pan-fried Pot Stickers dipped in a Szechuan Sauce that I just cannot order a meal there without having as a starter, followed by the always excellent and scorching Cajun Sausage & Seafood Chowder when it is served, I ventured off familiar ground and tried a few different dishes.  A Holy Cow! Reuben on toasted Rye, featuring lean and moist corned beef, melted cheese, and Sauerkraut, and aided and abetted by White Onions and French's Yellow Mustard, tasted great.  I will no doubt order this delicious sandwich again.  Crunchy French Fries were a lovely accompaniment.  And, after the Pot Stickers were originally forgotten by the chef, the manager wrote the appetizer off the bill.  On another occasion I enjoyed for my entree moist Pecan-Crusted Walleye Pike flown in from Wisconsin, while Diane enjoyed her usual Fried Shrimp &n Fries appetizer.  This time 4-1/2 stars were earned.

Co-worker: We're going to El Portal for lunch.Me: Que es el portal?Co-worker: Oh right. I always forget your not from here.So the review from Pierre is totally on-point. I went to El Portal with my co-workers who are all very involved in the state politics/worker scene. And sure enough while we were there a ton of staffers, court officials, reporters, etc would walk in and out. I don't know if I'd qualify it as a celebrity spot. And likely most wouldn't return if it was. But definitely is a really good spot tucked back just south of downtown. I had the chicken tostados which were fantastic. The service is lacking at best. But I was there around 12:30 and it was really packed. The servers were super nice...just too busy to be really attentive. There's also a huge painting of MLK and an enlarged Cesar Chavez stamp on the walls. I don't know that they have a stealth interior design person...but hey, who doesn't love a little awkwardly placed (but obviously beloved) Cesar and MLK!?

If the old city mainstay littered with sandwiches-of-old, walls festooned with photos of celebrities with the owner, and the SAME things they have been doing since they opened ever go out of style, then I'll quit at life. Peppi's isn't just a spot for lunch. It's a storybook opened to the meat of the climax of one incredible story. To say they have "history" would be a disservice. These guys wrote the book from what I can glean from the pictures sports memorabilia. I had the pleasure of visiting while in Pittsburgh this summer and was thrilled with the product and especially the service. I had a group of kids with me, so I made sure they didn't have to do too much talking for these fast-paced guys. We ordered a bunch of fries, drinks, and a mixtures of mains. Some of the kiddos decided to go for comforts (i.e. chicken fingers. Lame) but a few of us went for some menu titans. Namely, The Big Wheeler. Holy cow. Quite literally. Steak and sausage with provolone. Pretty unreal. It was a massive sandwich, too. All of the flavors melded together were like the Blues ancients, all of the Steelers and Pirates players, and all of the Ohio riverboat captains together were giving me high-fives. It just felt right. Meaty, greasy, melty, packed with flavor, and delightfully heavy. I felt like more of a complete human after having this sandwich. Though we were all famished from the seemingly manual labor we were doing, I could only make it through half of it in one sitting. Also, the owner and all of the folks on the line were incredibly nice. They had grace with our group and made us feel incredibly welcome. Pro Tip: Make sure you have cash for this location. They have an ATM in-house, but it'll speed things up if you have your own when you walk in. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, Peppi's will be a definite visit. Rock on.

Let me just state for some that I did not come here because of DDD and no, I did not try what was featured on the show.  I came here...well, simply because I was hungry and thirsty.Upon walking in this place makes you feel like you are in the wrong place, that is until you are warmly greeted by the bartender.  We didn't even have our coats off and were asked if we wanted something to drink.  We quickly settled on a draft and were brought menus.  Now, people, this place has a very small menu.  On top of the small menu there are specials that appear to change often.  A note to people also is that this place specializes in breakfast, half of the menu is for breakfast fare.  I almost ordered a special but decided to go with something from the menu.  I got the BLT and a side of fries; my friend got a cheese quesadilla and onion rings.This is the nice part, everything is cooked fresh when you order it!  My BLT was amazing.  The bacon was crispy, tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, and the bread was just toasted.  The fries are fresh cut.  So no frozen here, cut and then thrown in to fry.  With the light touch of mayo on the sandwich it surely hit the spot.  The quesadilla and onion rings looked good too, but I kept my mind on my own plate.This place, even though it is nothing more than a hole in the wall that has been there for "17 years" (I believe that's what the sign says outside) is amazing and charming.  It's small in here, so if you have a big party, don't expect to feel comfortable in here.  It's dark from the walls and small windows, which to me made it feel warm.  The decor is about as typical as you can expect with many places like this.  I totally liked that their dishes were mixed and matched.  Like they went to Goodwill next door and just bought every plate they had on the shelf.  It gives this place the "we don't go with the flow" feel that makes it work.After a satisfying meal the check arrived.  That was like the cherry on the cake, for two meals and two drafts, $15.  I kid you not.  Totally worth checking this place out for food and not just drink.We love coming here to eat. We literally live around the block so I pass by it often and I have to stop the temptation to eat out. I've had many things from here-- mixed grill breakfast, meatloaf, country fried steak.. all winners in my book. They also have great drink prices and a very friendly staff who are all hard workers. They play bartender, food server, cook and a person to vent to. When bobby has a week day off of work, he will wake up and come here for breakfast. He'll then meet me for my lunch hour downtown and say "i'm not hungry.. i stopped at Nadine's" I've heard that line atleast 5 times in the last 6 months

Review Text :
Well, I decided to start the year off right. And go to Church. I have to admit I hadn't been to Church in quite awhile. Such a sin. I know. I didn't get all dressed up but I did do the sign of the cross when I entered Church's. Oh. I meant to say Church's earlier in the review. Not church. My bad. How silly. What a silly yelper am I? Church's. You know. Double battered fried chicken. Deep fried okra. Powderd mashed potatoes. And the mac n cheese. Why the latter is indeed heavenly. And a sin at the same time. I'm not gonna compare the grease sticks here to the grease sticks at KFC or Popeye's. All kinda the same to me. But I can tell you the offering from Church's soaked up the booze from ringing out 07 the night before. Grease be with you. And also with you.

Bland, boring, "Mexican-esque" food. Warning sign #1: all white people dining there.Warning sign #2: salsa that's bland as ketchupWarning sign #3: no hot sauces on the tableThe three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials. Yet our plates looked almost indistinguishable from one another. On each was some configuration of flour tortillas, mountains of shredded iceberg lettuce, and a slick of pale refried beans, all topped with  orange cheese.You can get more flavorful "Mexican" food at Del taco. This place is more like Mexican't food. Ulgh. I want my $5.25 back.

I don't care what anyone says.  I love Sorrento's pizza.  My dad used to bring me here as a kid when he worked across the street.  As an adult, I figured I would be really disappointed, but it was just as good as I remember the pizza.Coming in for the first time at dinner time, my friends and I ordered an extra large pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese for $10.  The pizza is super greasy and will literally melt the paper plate away.  It arrives at your table fresh out of the oven and loaded with cheese and toppings.  Everything about this pizza is fantastic.  I pulled down four slices at dinner and three slices during the night.  I love this cheap pizza.  It's not authentic Italian, but it is so good nonetheless.The employees are super nice and casual, and the police were here eating dinner when we were.  That is always a good sign in my book.  My friends and I have started coming in regularly after our night classes end at 9 PM because we start craving their pizza in the middle of class.Super cheap and fast!

Review Text :
6 years ago, we did the American FOB thang and flew to Las Vegas to see the Taiwanese and Hong Kong R&B sensation version of J-Lo at the shitty Mandalay Bay Events Center (at ticket prices that would make U2, The Cure, and Radiohead blush), I suppose you can call her C-Lee, or stage name Coco Lee (real name ahem....Ferren Lee, gotta love Hong Kongers who try to get too creative with English names). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Lee(the pic in the link is old btw, you can probably find some more recent material on youtube if you want an idea).Coco is 100% Chinese, speaks fluent English having spent much time in the US since age 10 (attended UC Irvine at some point) yet somehow through vocal training can belt out (in her prime which has sadly past) a voice that almost sounds like Mo Town, and somehow managed to develop some serious badonkadonk that looked like it came straight outta Puerto Rico. So we sat down for the whole show, and Coco had to work on the crowd, most of whom were older A$Ns and younger AZNs who came from more conservative families and didn't seem to have a clue as to how to behave at pop concerts, and needed cues from the pop $en$ation herself that she needed more encouragement from the audience via louder screams, or some AZN announcer trying to work the crowd again at the end of the first set for an encore (when the reverse is true at western rock concerts, the audience automatically goes buck wild for encores without cues). At some point we were a bit worn out and jaded at this pseudo imported A$N pop concert experience and how lame it turned out to be (where half of the songs had no live band backing, and one song was lip sync'd to the studio album playing in the background, sorry Coco ain't Janet Jackson who in her prime sang AND danced) and immediately thought about where we could unwind from the madness (or lack thereof).So Tea Planet came into play. We knew about this place as TP (not toilet paper) is actually Tsing Shong Xiao Dzan, aka Tea Station Cafe. It is also owned by the same group or family who operates a chain of them across Southern California (and two locations in Nor Cal, Fremont and Newark) with them mainly stationed by the location by San Gabriel Square on Valley. (SGV).We had no set of wheels of our own, so we cabbed it here within less than 10 minutes. Don't remember too much about this place, except the menu mirrors the Tea Stations in Southern California, but not quite the same quality and vibe. My iced mixed fruit tea was overly sweetened (was my favorite drink at the Southern Cal TS). I suppose this location is better than the one in Nor Cal Newark, decent and passable and for sure way better than Quickbux or some other tapioca tea joint. Then again I'm a bit biased as I'm a fan of Ten Ren, straight outta Taiwan.In the words of a friend, TAIWAN ROCs! (Republic of China lolz).And Coco's a$$ got really big when we saw her again at the Shoreline in Mountain View CA  September 07 (actually we were there for opener Alex To, former druggie who at 40 going towards 50, still kicked a shitload of ass, like a stripper working overtime for that dollar). F******K still the same schtick from her about "I'm so nervous I need some encouragement", "are y'all cuh-rayzee AZN muckafuthas ready to par-tay? Lemme hear ya scuh-reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem b*tches!"At least Tea Planet and Ten Ren are much less predictable than a Co Co show. $ave your money and get some OG Tea $tation sippage.My friend and I were on a mission for boba... at 2am, so this was the only place that was open. One that would satisfy our craving, I mean.I had the milk green tea with boba, and it was perfect.  The only thing not so perfect was the increasing prices! I came here about a month or two ago, and the large teas were 4.75, which is now the price of the regular teas! The large is 6 whopping buckaroos!! 6 bucks for a large milk tea?! AND I payed for it!! Can someone please tell me what went wrong in that situation?!! Wahhh!!!On a better note, if you order your boba to-go, I believe you get 15 percent off your purchase?*NOTE: if you like paying for expensive and tasty boba, please remember to ask for a stamp card. Haha, thank you.Since moving to Vegas I have now discovered that Tea Station is indeed the best place for boba in the Las Vegas area. I'm not sure if my taste buds have adapted or if Tea Station has gotten better in the last few years. Either way they are the most authentic I've had in the area and I've been a boba master since the age of 11. Their prices are still a little high and a regular sized pearl milk tea will run close to $4.Haven't encountered the bad service issues that others complain about, but they do lose a star for their their $10 card minimum- and this whole damn plaza is like that.The coconut milk tea and coffee milk tea are both good here, and the boba is great: soft, good chewiness, good quantity. Millions of tea-flavored foods are here as well, the tea-flavored eggs and eel sound amazing but so far I haven't been brave enough to try them.Really ticked off about the $10 minimum- if food trucks can use Square without having a minimum, a brick and mortar building has no excuse. I drive by frequently and opt to go elsewhere because I rarely carry cash and won't order that much if I'm solo.Call me spoiled but I'm used to the land of boba and milk tea, Los Angeles. I guess that makes me a boba snob? Is that even a thing? I guess it can be. I'm still trying to find a good place for boba, teas and snacks in Vegas and my quest has come up with nothing so far. I tried Tea Station out one afternoon after having lunch with some friends in Chinatown. I've been to the ones in SoCal before and expected it to be pretty much the same thing. I guess it was okay. I had a green milk tea with grass jelly regular size and it came out to about $5.. It was a little pricey and the grass jelly was just alright.However, this place has a HUGE menu and selection of teas, milk teas, smoothies, etc and a food menu as well! I think if I were to come back, I want to try their popcorn chicken (Chinese popcorn chicken, mind you) which I have been craving!Tea Station is in the same plaza as Ichiza and parking can be a toughie sometimes since there are a very limited number of spots in the plaza so may the parking deities be with you on your quest as well!3.5 stars for Tea Station!I first came to this Tea Station on a Vegas outing with the boys.  One of them had a crush on a worker here and we were all forced to join in on the ride.  Seeing that there's a minimum for card purchases, we were all advised to bring cash.  Not a bad little tip!  While I find their prices to be a bit high for bubble tea, they mike a delicious Rose Milk Green Tea and a Royal Milk Tea.  There's no way around it.  It's the perfect amount of sweetness and flavoring.  I haven't tried much of their food or any other drinks but it's still a pretty delicious cup of tea.They have a pretty extensive menu compared to any boba tea houses I've been to and they sell a lot of tea.  Parking can be challenging but hey, it's Chinatown.  It's always super busy and the staff can be a bit snooty at times.  Oh well.  I'm just here to give my liver a break and to drink some milk tea.I don't have that many Asian friends, but when we have time to all hang out, Tea Station is always the place we go to catch up. And it seems like that's the case for most people here too. I've also come several times just to pick up an order I've called in or to wait while my car is being fixed up the street. I've been to Kung Fu Tea, Volcano Tea, and even the one in the Chinatown Mall on the first floor (forgot their name sorry!) And I always come back to Tea Station because of the large seating area, bright lighting inside, not smelling overly like fried foods, and the overall variety of food and drinks they have here. Oh and an important thing, I like the texture of the boba here the best! I wish they offered small boba though :( Where in Vegas is small boba?? Let's talk about service. It doesn't exactly exist, as most places in Chinatown. I would normally take off a star for how amazing they seem to be at hiding but I'm a little slack on the Chinatown places, so 4 stars it is just for the atmosphere, snacks and drinks.The go-to drinks (I always get them with boba): -Current favorites:  Hot Black Passion Tea & Rose Milk Tea -Hot Lavender Milk Tea -Mango/Coconut/Lychee Slush -Strawberry Pudding The go-to snacks:-Takoyaki (Octopus Balls)-Taiwanese Sausage -Fried Spicy ChickenAll three of these are salty and flavorful. Ultimate junky snack food lol & I seriously hate Honey Toast in general cause it's just a huge block of bread with honey and butter butttt it smells good, and the friends all love it here, so you may want to try it.Also, if you love sweet stuff and Mango, get their Mango shaved ice when it's in season. The Mango is so soft and juicy and sweet and they aren't stingy with the Mango either!Some tips:-Feel free to adjust the sweetness! They normally come pretty sweet so if you like less sweetness,  just tell them less sweet.-Always bring cash! You have to spend $10 minimum  to use card.-If you need assistance, don't be shy, flag someone down. They won't come to you otherwise lol -If you like Hot drinks, order the large and it comes in this gigantic cute bowl that's easily sharable for 2 people.Enjoy! :)

I was so pleased with the personal attention I got in picking out a gift for the beer drinker in my life. I brought in chocolates that needed beer pairings and the staff enthusiastically found me matches without breaking my bank account. They took time to label beers for the appropriate chocolates and packed my beers in easy to carry boxes. Awesome!(Also, recently found my mom's favorite hard-to-find wine at Barriques.) Needless to say - stop for coffee, go gift shopping! Love.

Review Text :
There is no place in Madison that has as much history with me as Paisan's.  Years (like lots, and lots of years) ago in high school we would eat there after our state forensics meets - we drove 4 hours from Northern WI to get to Madison, and this was the highlight of our trip (well, that and getting to stay in a hotel without our parents, score!).  In college we went to their University Square location after every concert and recital because it was a short walk across the street from the Humanities building.  My roommate used to use her fake ID to buy their sangria. Once, I even went to eat just in the hopes of catching glimpse at the guy I was crushing on (now my husband) who was there with a friend that night. Paisan's has history for me.I don't love their new location as much as the old.  Even with the transported booths, it doesn't have the character as the original, but they tried. I've had amazing servers and so-so servers.  All of that aside...what I love about Paisan's is their consistency.  Their manicotti remains in my top 5 foods of all time...because it NEVER changes.  It's always served in the same plates, the same way, with an olive on top. The sangria. The mozzarella cheese bread. The porta salad.  It's all exactly the same as it was when I was a fresh-faced 15 year old, excited to be in Madison for the first time. To some people this might be frustrating, but to me, it's nostalgic and perfect.  No, Paisan's may not be the very best Italian food you can get in the Madison area. But it's good - and will always be one of my favorites!

I had lunch with Jacob L. in this rather charming little gem in Sunnyslope. The restaurant is bright, clean, and cheerfully decorated. The food was tasty and inexpensive. The rice and beans that came with my order were good. Of the 3 tacos I tried, I liked the pastor the best - it was really tasty; the carne asada was good, and the tongue was not as flavorful as I had expected but still OK (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/wQ4qreKh5KMxoo2WjsZumw/l). Good quality food, so  I'm definitely coming back here - probably on a weekend, to try the other dishes - especially the menudo. And of course I HAVE to get the flan.

Were it not for my insatiable craving for carne asada fries, I would have never ventured over to this "local" side of Sahara Avenue.  This Roberto's is located right next door to PT's Pub, and I mean RIGHT NEXT DOOR.  Like, they share the same door and same wall.  So, as you're sitting in the tiny restaurant of Roberto's, enjoying your food, you'll definitely feel the bass of hip hop music bumping next door.  Or, if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to listen to every word of a horrible rendition of Babyface's "Everytime I Close My Eyes" during karaoke nights.So, how were the carne asada fries, you ask?  For $7.10, I thought they were on the pricey side.  They weren't as good as you'll find in San Diego, but good enough to whet my palate until I visit SD again.  The SO had them for the very first time and was intrigued with the whole french fries thing.  I didn't care too much for the huge dollops of sour cream and I thought the fries could have been served hotter.What was annoying about the service was that the guys behind the counter were working at the pace of snails.  And while people were waiting in line to order, the cashier was just chatting on his cell phone.  How rude!I work in the area and although have driven past many times I had never noticed this taco shop. Today while at work a few coworkers and I were wanting to pick up some grub for lunch so a friend suggested Don Tortacos. The best idea of the day was calling in an order which was promptly prepared for us. The services is great and their food looks and taste impressive. The items ordered were carne asada fries, hard shell carnitas tacos and a carne asada burrito.My burrito was Amazeballs, I swear it must have had at least two pounds of carne asada meat stuffed in it. I like my meat, I can handle my meat however this seemed a bit of a challenge for the first time in my life. This burrito was so good it made me horny. I was stimulated, I was aroused, I was wanting it over and over this day. I made love to my burrito with every flavorful bite and swallow. I will be back for sure, as I want to try other things on their menu that look irresistible. Food price is reasonable, friendly staff, a great salsa bar with those yummy spicy carrots and green salsa.I will be back for sure as it has left me yearning for more! I am a dirty little whore for this place.

You will find Country Boys Restaurant at the intersection of Camelback, I-17 and School Cafeteria Food Rd.They violated my 3B's of diner safety!  The breakfast food was OK, I didn't have a BLT, but my wife's burger was...not OK.  As soon as I saw that bad boy I recognized the perfectly preformed roundness and the unusual texture that says "cafeteria burger".But I waited for her reaction.  I tasted my side of home fries with onions and my single pancake.  The home fries were fine, slightly underdone but fine.  The pancake was also fine.  A tad sproingy but fine.  "How's your food?""The fries are good.""And the burger?""It's a little off.  Prefab and the flavor and texture are familiar, but from a long time ago.  I can't place it.""School cafeteria perhaps?""That's it.  Exactly."

Review Text :
Please note that this review is for their Wednesday buffet, not the ladies or their gyrations. So, a friend and biz associate invited me out to what she quoted as "the best buffet in Charlotte" at The Men's Club. Skeptical as I was, I accepted as I love a great buffet. Plus she mentioned that there is a whole wall of desserts and that pretty much sealed the deal. I lunched with two female associates and one male associate. The venue: Yup, it's a strip club. All day. These ladies are working hard for their money. However, the space itself is really nice. It's clean, it's pretty, it's, well, almost luxe looking - at least in the semi dark dining area. The staff: Our waitresses were nice, efficient and fully clothed. That made digging into the buffet much easier. The food: Delicious. Seriously. It's a magical buffet full of so many different types of cuisines. Chef Brian is really nice and he was hanging out by the prime rib - yes, the actual meat - that is not a metaphor for something else. Everything was cooked well and there was enough variety for any palate. Big hits here: mac 'n cheese, asian chicken, perfectly steamed veggies and a nice fresh fruit spread. The dessert section wasn't at large as I thought but it filled the void for my sweet tooth.Overall: Would I go back? Sure, for the Wednesday buffet. My meal was taken care of by one of my dining partners, but for these 70+ buffet options the cost was $10 per person. If you can stomach viewing a bit of T&A during your lunch, definitely give this stellar buffet a try. Just don't face the stage and make sure to hide your singles.I have been an entertainer here for about 3 years off and on. All of the managers here are extremely professional, no drugs are inside this club which is rare. Girls here are very nice mature and pretty. Love the DJ. And love working at this club. Beautiful, wide range of dancers, cheap to go upstairs! Check it out!

Review Text :
I'm so grateful that Ashley recommended us to visit Eldorado Grill for restaurant week! We managed to get seats within 20 minutes of calling. They set us down promptly and we quickly got settled with drinks and snacks to start! I love our starter - this gigantic bowl of guacamole and chips. The chips came out hot, so either they made their chips (hurray!) or they heated it up at least. The guacamole tasted delicious and we could stop getting more. Took 2 baskets of chips to finish the guacamole among 4 people (Thanks Ashley!).There was a myriad of drinks and if you're a fan of Tequila, you're in for a treat here! Onotse got Mojitos (2 actually, since it was that good), Ashley got a honey ginger alcoholic mix and Matt got a smokey tequila cocktail. Everyone enjoyed their drinks! So, restaurant week - for serving so many people of the same dish, I'm impressed. The Green Chile Pork stew was PERFECTLY done. soft pork that tears apart with the fork, the green chile was aptly spiced, not too hot but keeps you warm. LOVE IT. Onotse got a GIGANTIC salad for only $1.29. and it comes with lots of spinach, walnuts and some other things. Ashley got the jalapeno poppers, which looked just like bacon wrapped dates but instead of dates, there's jalapeno. She said she would get it again, but you should share it with some other person.Main dish, most of us got the smoked brisket. It was alright for me, not over the top, but the dish was a hearty meal. Lots of beans, lots of salad (no dressing), nice potato salad, lovely corn pancake (in place of corn bread). And the brisket was served on a piece of bread. Lots of meat to keep you full. But I was expecting more like braised beef, instead of spam-like texture? Definitely not something I would pick up again..Finally, for dessert, I got the pecan chile pie. I didn't like the crust since I'm a cookie/graham cracker crust fan.. Also, there was no obvious chile spice in the pie.. tasted more like pecan chocolate pie. It was alright. Matt got the mole root beer (mole ice cream), but sadly it had peanuts so the rest of us got to try it. It was REALLY spicy. Don't think anyone can finish that lump of spicy ice cream. spicy and cold at the same time, what an experience!!There's covered outdoor seating in the summer as well!HIT THE TRAIL FLAP JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKS!(They're where it's at you guys!)Eldorado and I didn't get off to a great start, but I'm here to tell ya, because of the noticeable improvement over the past 3 months, I've come to really enjoy the place! It takes some incredible leadership to cut through choppy waters and redirect what I decided a year ago was a sinking ship, and before I dig in and talk your ear off (your eyes off?) about the best pancakes you'll ever consume, I have to single out Eldorado's GM, Taylor, for being so interested in the success of the restaurant and implementing a wealth of feedback from the community. E-hug, buddy! And now, those cakes. I have consumed more Hit The Trail Flap Jacks in the month of May than I care to admit. I've also had more conversations about these rounders with various people than I care to admit. (Seriously, I have talked A LOT about these pancakes.) I really don't understand how something as simple as batter could taste so good. Maybe it's the addition of pumpkin seeds, pecans, almonds and raisins? Or maybe it's the cherries, apricots or red chile butter that's dolloped on top? Maybe it's the texture, which honestly you guys, is mind boggling good. They're fluffy, but hearty with a crisped outer edge and cake like insides. And they're HUGE. A serving of two is substantial. But you can also get one as a side if you're looking to add a little meat to your morning and want some strips of bacon or sausage, like I did last time. When I learned that you can order just one cake, my world changed. Changed!  People always tell me Eldorado has one of the best brunches in town, and because of a few rocky encounters right after I moved here I sort of dismiss everyone and decide they don't know what they're talking about. But I've had brunch, several times this month, and I can safely say this will be your new favorite spot. The menu is extensive and spans traditional American and more tex-Mex inspired plates on par with their dinner menu. The added convenience of being able to make a reservation on Sunday morning ROCKS. And though it's small, the outdoor space is lovely when a breeze blows past. Make a reservation for Sunday. Get some Hit The Trail Flap Jacks. Explain to me why they're so damn good.

Yum I think we have found a new go to spot to add to our rotation of options for a good pizza pie!My boyfriend and I just happened upon this joint via a coupon in the local edition of the 2013 entertainment guide as we wanted to try a new place. There was a coupon for 50% off of any pizza so I quickly yelped it and saw a four star rating. I read some of the reviews which boasted of their famous garlic knots as well so there we went to satisfy our pizza fix!We decided on the 16' uptown white pizza (mozzarella), their other white pizza is made with ricotta cheese instead. We also got an order of one dozen garlic knots that come with a side of marinara sauce.Wow, the pizza was delicious and drizzling with olive oil, and the garlic knots were fresh with butter and garlic! The crust and generous amount of cheese on the pizza was Amazing. I had an orgasm of flavor in my mouth and it felt and tasted so damn good!They took $7.00 off of our pizza with the 50% off coupon we had so our large pizza and dozen garlic knots total only came to $12 which is a bargain for so much food!We will be back and now we have a paper menu to review which is full of so many of their great food options to try!We are fans!First star: I'm in agreement with everyone else that the ranch dressing here is like crack. It's garlicky and delicious, and I'm not normally a ranch fan.Second star: I appreciate that they sell both Neapolitan and Sicilian pies, both whole and by the slice. Get a classic cheese slice, or add a topping. If you opt for meatball, it's a good amount, chopped and spread out over the slice. Neapolitan crust is crisper than expected but the cheese and sauce were very light and not particularly flavorful.Third star: they have several different lunch combos, available Mon-Fri til 3PM. Most are $7-10, including various pastas, salads, sandwiches, and slices. They get surprisingly busy during a mid-week lunch, but service is quick and efficient.

Whoa!  That's allot of meat!I stopped here for a quick lunch.  I had the Gyro combo.  Everything tasted just as expected.  It's funny how you can get a Gyro at some little place in Anycity, USA and it will taste almost exactly the same.  Sort of the Greek equivalent of the Big Mac.  There must be only one supplier for the Gyro loaf that they all use.What I would have liked from Athen's was 50% less meat and 100% more onion, tomato and dressing.  I left them a Yelp card so hopefully they will read the review.  My Gyro had easily enough meat for 2 sandwiches.  I was tossing off meat.Did I just say tossing off meat?

Some girlfriends of mine wanted to meet up for a Sunday breakfast, and Bill Johnson's was the place that was picked.  I have to be honest when I heard this was the place I thought, well hell Bill Johnson's isn't even a place I would pick to go for dinner.So off I went to meet up with them. Ok I under estimated Bill Johnson's for sure! We had a table in the saloon area, and our waitress was Cookie! Man she was awesome! Cookie was the greatest!  She kept us stocked in coffee, water, creamer and more! Her personality was always upbeat! I ordered an Arizona Omelets, which had Schreiner's fresh chorizo, green chilies, and tomatoes, pepper jack cheese with a side of home fries and a biscuit and gravy! OK this was a kick ass breakfast! Everything was delish!! The omelet was light, fluffy and full of flavor; the home fries were perfectly cooked. The biscuit and gravy, oh damn, that's some good stuff, my country lovin side was so very happy!!!  Biscuit & Gravy are my favorite breakfast dishes!  It was a great meal with friends, amazing service as well!Went here Friday night with my wife Carol and our friend Kathy for Karaoke in the bar/saloon. We arrived early for dinner (around 6pm), Karaoke started at 7pm. I have to admit it's been years sine I've been here and when I used to go it was in the restaurant not the bar/saloon..We were immediately seated and ask what we wanted to drink  and then the waitress (her name was Cookie) took our order Carol & Kathy ordered the all-y-u-can-eat fish, I asked if I could try a small piece before I ordered.  Cookie said that would be no problem.Cookie brought out drinks and me two small pieces of fish. I tasted it and decided I would order it as well.. When the fish came the pieces we very large and piping hot. The batter wasn't to heavy and the fish was mouthwateringly moist, flaky, tender and tasty. We all agreed we like the fish was cooked perfectly, which is a rarity.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Freshness characterizes everything we had. Highly recommended I was pleasantly surprised . The service was excellent and the food was served promptly and efficient. Freshness characterizes everything FOOD: Huge portions, Top quality SERVICE: Genuine good service which was a joy to witness. Our waitress was professional and attentive. PRICE: Comparable to other steak restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. Yet popular with the locals and a place to bring out of town guests.  CONCLUSION: RETURN FACTOR 100%. ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH

Review Text :
Authentic, tasty and hearty Italian cookin that even my wonderful, Italian grandma wouldn't mind diving into - and that's saying a lot. Yes, my grandmother is one of the best cooks in the world (major bias, I'm sure) but Portofino's throws down some damn tasty eats.I stopped by Portofino's to catch up with a friend over a casual lunch. While their menu looked pretty enticing I went with their lunch special "bake": two jumbo stuffed shells, one manicotti, baked and covered in meat sauce. While I can't get grandma's cookin' in Charlotte, this was a very solid substitute! The shells and manicotti were perfectly cooked (not overly so) and stuffed with delicious ricotta. And the sauce - purty tasty too - although I would have been delighted with another manicotti and less sauce. But that's just personal preference!The service was friendly and attentive and I never went without at least a half-full beverage. Plus, the prices are pretty affordable - my bake was $7.95. Not bad! I absolutely want to come back and try their 'za and maybe a whole tray of desserts. Nom!

Review Text :
HORRIBLE TREATMENT.  After having been a very frequent customer, we went to the cafe around 4:30 on a Friday.  The food has always been priced a little high for the quality, but it is a local business and my boss is a local businessman.  He likes to dine other small businesses..  This past visit it was dead empty with the exception of staff.  It was my boss, his young-adult children and a fourteen month old baby and me.  We were seated and enjoying a little of wine, the most expensive bottle on their very limited and impressively unimpressive wine list.  What WAS outrageous was that the horrible way the owner treated us.  Out of nowhere, and I must remind you, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant, the owner came over and demanded we make the baby stop pounding on the table.  ...not my baby, and I'm one of those people who doesn't really like noisy kids, but I'm telling you, that was not the situation.  These were chubby baby hands on the table with a laughing baby...and who were we bothering?  We thought he was joking until we saw the look on his fat face.  My boss said "just pack our food to go". The owner turned around, not even out of earshot of our table and said "that a--hole wants is food to go.  Pack that sh-- up and get him the f--- out of here."Small wonder the place was empty.  Overpriced food, lousy wine selection and not even a friendly neighborhood atmosphere.  This is a NO GO.

Restaurant name  Winchells Donuts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Yeah I know, a commercial establishment which I normally don't visit, however this location deserves a good Yelp! Open 24/7, all donuts fresh fried and glazed. I walked in and looked at the display rack of fresh donuts, literally saw them glistening with their generous freshly just glazed icing. $7.99 for a dozen, well 14 donuts to be exact, not sure if that is standard or just because I walked in with two nice big plump donuts of my own? Anyhow that is a steal for fresh, moist, melt in your mouth donuts at 2am. Service is great, I mean really I don't expect mind blowing service from a donut shop, much less at 2am. Also does not take much skill or thrill to fill a box with donuts. The gentleman working this particular early morning shift had lots of spunk and vigor. He is one with tons of personality, joking and told me my total was 7 million dollars, you know those funny types. Really refreshing considering he works graveyard! Yay Winchell's, (S. Jones location) as I can not speak for the rest as a lot of them are franchise now. This location rocks!24/7 donuts, bagels, coffee, and sandwiches- what more could you ask for?! Service is quick, fast, and usually bilingual. The bagel sandwiches are a favorite of mine, as well as their iced hazelnut coffee. If you need to grab breakfast for your work squad, call ahead for a discount: the Winchell's dozen (14 assorted glazed and filled donuts, bars, and twists) is entirely customizable and regularly $10, but calling ahead with a large order has saved me a few bucks, thanks to friendly management. But I keep coming back for the sandwiches: $5 for a bagel sando packed with fresh toppings, add a dollar for chips and a drink. The turkey is my go-to, but the BLTCC (BLT + cream cheese) is a tasty indulgence too, if you opt for savory over sweet. Note that the bagels themselves are not of stellar quality- they can be a bit hard (rather than chewy) even when they're not toasted.

Review Text :
I visited this restaurant with a friend for lunch a week ago.  We were having an informal lunch meeting to talk about some business, so I suggested this place and a couple of others that were convenient for both of us.  She chose Prince of India, so we both met up here around noon.Technically, I'd been once before, but I hadn't actually eaten anything here because I'd already had dinner, so I count this as being my first time.  The food is your typical Indian buffet fare, including chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, saag, pita bread, navratan korma, and rice on the hot bar, and several vegetables and sauces on the cold bar.  I picked up some of all of the aforementioned dishes, plus some cucumber yogurt sauce from the cold bar.  I found the food pretty average in quality for Indian buffet food--not great, but not horrible, either.  Because I wasn't terribly impressed, I stuck with one plate, and didn't go for seconds.At the time of our visit, the dining room was pretty quiet, so it was a good place to have a business lunch.  (Indeed, I spotted one of my supervisors in the row of tables on the other side talking to a colleague...)  The decor is pretty nondescript for an Indian restaurant, with one TV playing Bollywood music videos in the back.If you study or work at Pitt or UPMC, be sure to bring your ID to take advantage of the $1 discount.  The lunch buffet price is $9, which is pretty average for the area.  Given the average food, average decor, average prices, and even average service, the main thing this place has going for it is convenience for those who work in Oakland.  If you're able to do so, I'd recommend walking down Atwood or over to Craig to check out the superior Indian offerings there.  However, if you need a quiet, uncrowded place for lunch and don't want to walk any further than Fifth Ave., Prince of India will do just fine.

Review Text :
Yikes, what happened to Macaroni Grill?!?!?!? I used to love coming here. We did get seated right away but getting acknowledged by our server after being seated was another story. They seemed very busy. After quenching my thirst because I finally got my drink ordering was under way. I asked for a "House Salad" with extra ranch to start. Then for my meal I ordered the "Build Your Own Pasta". It was noodles, arrabbiata sauce and buffalo mozzarella. The server brought me a caesar salad instead if the house salad I ordered. Then brought the right salad after I was almost finished with my pasta. The food was good but service was lacking very much. It was clean inside and they just finished a remodel so they now have both booths and tables to sit at. They still have the curbside to go if you want to phone in an order to go.Outside is a nice patio should you feel like eating outdoors.This place is hit or miss and after my last experience I'm thinking it will be a miss for a while. I have stopped by several times since they introduced the "express lunch service" where when you order from the express menu you get your order in 7 minutes or less for $7. Each time I went in for lunch the manager gave me a BOGO coupon and said that even after it was expired that he'd still honor it. Sounds nice but I'm sure it's because the location is hurting. Inside there has either been nobody dining inside or maybe 2 table with customers while i"m waiting for my order. The only thing I have had that's been worth it is a sausage and rigatoni dish. It's a good portion and tastes decent but a lot of the other menu items have been terrible and not worth the $7 let alone anything higher. I got a bit sick after eating the caprese sandwich as well the pulled pork sandwich. They will give you a free loaf of bread and some oils to go but you will have to ask for it to guarantee getting it.Had I written this review about 8 years ago, I would have happily given this establishment a 5/5 review. Unfortunately, times have changed and the fairly recent revamping of the menu, cooking styles, and value has fallen short in recent years. Today my Dad was visiting and he wanted to take the kids to lunch. He had several gift cards to Romano's Macaroni Grill so off we went. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately. If this review was strictly based on the service, I would have no problem giving them a 5/5. Unfortunately, the food quality alone takes this review to the 3/5 mark. The Rosemary bread and oil accompaniment was delicious as always. The service by Sandra was excellent on all levels. Quick to refill drinks and quick to bring additional bread as requested. The appetizers and main dishes, however, left much to be desired. My dad ordered two appetizers: one of stuffed mushrooms, which appeared to be extremely greasy and possibly frozen; and other of Calamari which was an extremely small serving and though tasty, were a bit over-fried. For my main course, I had the $10 3 course lunch special. It included a single triangle of fried cheese, a small Caesar salad, and a main dish which I picked the Fettucini Gorgonzola. Though it was okay, the cheese sauce was layered in oil and dripped off each piece of pasta, leaving me with a sunken stomach and an overall bloated feeling. It really seems like the quality of the food has taken a strong dive in recent years and it is because of the food quality alone that I must give them a 3/5.Service was 2 stars, the guy did not want to be there. Food was 3.5 stars I had a Pollo Caprese which is a grilled chicken breast in a lemon butter type sauce served with thin noodles and cherry tomato sauce. It also had 4 small bites of cheese which I suppose was homemade mozzarella? While it was all good, it was just boring. Nothing stood out and said "Hey you really like this" Just average food. Now I remember why it has been years since we have been there.

(check the open and closing time).This place has been around for a many years. Actually has a 2nd location. Everytime I speak on this place, I tell ppl that they will bring you a TO-GO BOX when they bring your food out b/c YOU WILL NOT finish the food. Salt & Pepper fish, shrimpNot sure why in the south ordering Tea is heard as... "PLEASE BRING ME BROWN SUGAR WATER...PLEASE...PLEASE"... no biggie, its the norm around these parts. No knock on this place. I always get the Create you Combo... 3 for (I forgot how much) instead of the Create Your Own 2 for (I forgot how much) your choice of BROILED, FRIED, BLACKENDDifferent choices of Fish, Scallops, Oysters, Shrimp,Scallops are huge, Oysters are ummm OysterYHushpuppies are good...

Hmmm maybe I came on an off time because my service was quite good, although I was also one of the few tables in here. Before I came here for a visit, I was looking at a New York yelper's food blog. Strangely enough she was talking about where some of the best Chinese food and that it can be found in the strangest of places. She mentioned this place, I knew I had to stop by to try it. I really liked this place. Prices were very fair and the portions were just enough to make me full but not stuff me. I came here for lunch and had their ginger chicken and asked them to make it extra spicy. I started off with their egg drop soup, which unlike many that I have had, didn't need me to add extra salt. My ginger chicken came out, for a lunch portion I was very happy with the portion I got, filled with veggies, a slightly sweet and spicy sauce paired with  the fried rice I chose which was just okay. For a filled tummy, cute although some what hokey decor, I left and I was a happy man.

We came in after spending the day at the Science Center.  Love the courtyard dining area, but we wanted air conditioning and to check out the inside.  We got a monster table all to ourselves.  Nice.  Even nicer was the view of downtown.BJ got a Penn Wheatson beer.  It was very good, simliar to a Blue Moon or a Hoeggarten.  Since we were feeling a little German, BJ got the pierogi plate and I got käsespätzle.  We liked both our dishes.  My accompanying salad had some brown pieces of lettuce. But I forgave that because our server was kind enough to bring us a sample of the hot German potato salad.  All in all, a pretty decent meal.  But of course, we always going to like any brewery.

Review Text :
I travel extensively and globally, entertaining customers and enjoy the opportunity to try some of the best ,and unfortunately some of the most overrated, places in major cities.Unfortunately, Zebra falls into the category of "I'm not going there again." The waiter starts off with the special entrees and give us the pitch on the oysters and the scallop appetizers. We socialize a bit and he comes back and four of us place our orders. After a bit, the waiter comes back to inform us our appetizer (oysters) are actually sold out and he's very sorry. We order an Oregon Pinot, Penner Ash, a solid good Shea Vineyard selection which we've tried before.The menu is a bit over the top. Every dish seems to have something in it to kill the patron. For example the "Simple Fish" is a flounder in and wine and butter sauce with some tapenade....blah, blah, blah...the covered with a lobster tail with some cream sauce. I'm like "what?, that's simple?" Finally, I asked what's the lightest thing on the menu and was directed to chicken in a hollandaise sauce. Get REAL folks!. You can't eat this ostentatious crap and 1) expect it to be "French food", and 2) expect to continue live to the next day. I was in France less than 6 months ago. The French do not eat this crap. OK, I'll get off my soapbox....the menu was extreme, but there were some salad options as starters.Personally, I had the Zebra salad which was good and had organic greens, raspberry and citrus fruits. I ended up ordering the simple fish w/o the lobster and w/o the sauce. If the flounder is good, why ruin it? It was ok. We shared a dessert and coffee afterwards.Then, we got the check which totaled about $400 for 4 people with 1 bottle of wine. We couldn't figure out how this happened until we realized we either misread, (or our menu was incorrect), the price of the Penner Ash....it was $155 and we thought it was $70. We called the waiter back and he said he's see what he could do. I googled the wine and the full retail price on the web ranges from 38.99 to 52.99. 400% markup on wine is unheard of! Even if we made a mistake, we were appalled and disappointed at Zebra's pricing and subsequent treatment. Needless to say, we paid and left. (Zebra did offer us 10% off the wine after the waiter phoned the owner.)The ambiance is good, service is raw for a "fine french restaurant" and food average or sub-optimal. Combine this with ridiculous mark-up and my suggestion is find another place to dine. The place won a lot of awards and realizing I'm going against the grain, however, this isn't 21st century good food, good service or even a good menu.  I'm very disappointed with this selection.(Definitely falls into Yelp's "splurge" category without the complete "experience")WARNING - this is a LONG review, but I wanted to do Zebra justice. I took a BIG chance here on a "special" Valentine's Day dinner with my wife. I say this because most of our experiences with "special" meals have not turned out to be very good (California Wine Country restaurants excluded - everyone was phenomenal). Anyway, I digress....So I signed up for the 4 course dinner of $85/person. Certainly not the cheapest, but also quite a bargain (if you can call it that) in comparison to other larger cities given the Quality, quantity and special occasion (for example - a similar meal in Vegas would be $150 ++ EACH....see what I mean?).There were about 4 or 5 choices for each of the four courses, so it was nice having those choices. Of course, my French Canadian wife beat me to the seared Fois Gras, and I had the Mushroom Truffle soup. Well, all I can say is HOLY $^*%#! was that ever good! My wife and I have had the fortune of dining at some of the very best restaurants on this continent, and I've got to say that my Mushroom Truffle soup, of which they added some FOIS GRAS to, was superbly sublime.....is that a term? I don't care, I'm using it anyway. Of course her Fois Gras was Fois Gras. Food Perfection. So off to an AWESOME start.Second course was a salad course. They have a special "Zebra" salad, but the waiter (and Wine Steward Michael) suggested I try their version of a Beet Salad, with Roquefort Cheese and candied walnuts. Now I admit to NOT being a huge beet fan, but Michael convinced me that they do theirs very differently. I said WTF and went for it. And I am very glad I did! I don't know what they marinaded their beets in, but it didn't have that typical "beet flavor." And as I get older, Blue Cheese tastes better and better to me (never been my favorite in the past). And paired with the beets and crunch of the candied walnuts, with some mircrogreens, it was again, AWESOME! 2 for 2.Main course for the wife was Tournedos of Beef, with a Bordelais sauce. Meat was perfectly cooked, and there was actually a lot of it (surprising for a French restaurant - like 8 oz). I got their signature Pasta Basket, which was freshly made pasta made into a basket (looked like a bird's next), filled with fresh Shrimp, Scallops, Lobster and Filet Mignon. I mean, come on! How could I not order that! And here's the somewhat strange part - they deep fry the entire thing for like a minute until everything is cooked to perfection. Now this was a surprise, and it was my #3 AWESOME rating for the night......you're on a roll Zebra.Dessert, my wife was pretty full (couldn't eat all her Tournedos so I had to man up to help....:-) so she got the standard Creme Brulee, which was quite good. I got the Souffle, complete with dark Belgian Chocolate. Now I would expect a French themed restaurant to be able to cook a Souffle properly, and Zebra did that to perfection! That Dark Belgian Chocolate poured down the center was divine! While the Creme Brulee was standard fare (though quite good), my Souffle made this the #4 AWESOME rating for the night.Now I haven't mentioned the Piece de Resistance.....the WINE. I asked for something "different" (meaning, not the usual Cab Sauv, Zin, etc.) So Michael, the Wine Steward, recommended a wine from a Napa maker called Falcor Bilancia. This is a Meritage (rhymes with Heritage) wine consisting of the unusual blend of Zin, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Charbono! At 15.4% alcohol, this was a BIG wine, but typical for CA, well balanced and YUMMY! AT least for us lovers of BIG BOLD wines. Perhaps not the BEST pairing for some of the more delicate food items we had, but it was the BEST WINE for the evening. Splurged $110 for this bad boy. Expensive? Sure. Worth it? Absolutely!All in all an expensive but AWESOME meal, top to bottom. The wait staff was excellent, Michael the young Wine Steward was excellent. Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. Michael knew this regular customer in the table next to us, and they were drinking a wine, also from the maker Falcor, called "Parker Em." Michael said that this was a very limited release wine, and it almost had a "Cult status" (meaning, Screaming Eagle, etc.). He asked that customer if I could have a sip of the Parker Em if I gave him a taste of my Bilancia. He agreed, and man was that Parker Em AWESOME, in a different way that my Bilancia was. While the Bilancia was reminiscent of a Duckhorn Paraduxx wine, the Parker Em reminded me oh so much of a 1997 Joseph Phelps Insignia, a near 100 point wine. Never did this in a restaurant before, so it was a tremendous experience, especially given the quality of these wines.So would I recommend Zebra! 1000000000000000000000000% YES! They have special wine tastings and wine dinners to, and I can't wait to attend some of those! Oh, and not every visit has to be a Prix Fixe experience and super expensive. I think the next time we'll just go for a nice quite evening and simply order off the menu. Bon Appetite!Went for valentine's dinner and as mentioned in other reviews, the tables are very close to one another making it not romantic at all. The waiter was the most rude person I have ever met, he has no business being in the service industry. First offense: The salads that came out were not the salads we ordered. I didn't want to complain because the salad I had in front of me looked good but my husband's did not so he decided to tell the waiter. The waiter promptly took our plates and gave them to another table across the room. Unfortunately this happened after I had taken a bite of my salad. Thankfully I noticed what had happened and warned the recipient of the used salad before they dug in. When the manager came over to ask about the situation he made no apology and somehow found nothing wrong with giving someone a salad touched by someone else. Then this same situation happened to the table sitting next to us. Second offense: Upon receiving our main course my husband asked if the waiter could describe the dish (partly because he was worried he would have the same switch-up happen) and the waiter just replied with "food." Looking back on it, this would have been a funny response had I been in a fast food chain and not pay $270 for a below par meal. The food was average and nothing special. I would never ever go back and feel that I was robbed.

Review Text :
Munch a Sub makes me want to munch on a sub.What I am honestly a fan of is their breakfast menu. They offer good food at reasonable rates. The English muffin sausage with cheese is huge and the sausage is King of that meal. Whether you want to walk in or have delivery this place is a must. It is good, fresh and tasty food.You can't go wrong with their roast beef sandwich, one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They have like 30 options to chose from when it comes to their lunch menu.Want something local with a lots of flavor? Then this is must do for you.Munch a sub? More like Massive Subs! This spot is semi-hidden in the warehouse area, and a hot spot for blue-collar boys grabbing lunch. Portions are large and prices are fair, with most 6" sandwiches clocking in at a mere $8 and change. Menu also offers some soups, pastas, and specials, like chili cheese dogs.The #43 is a roast beef and turkey combo, with super-fresh bread and an ample amount of meat. My only gripe is that I added provolone and didn't receive it, so maybe this isn't the best place for customized orders. BF was a little underwhelmed with the Pastrami sando, with minimal melted swiss and thousand island sauce, but it's definitely a large amount of meat.Service was friendly and quick. Interior is clean with a ton of seating crammed into the small spot, ~30 chairs. Crowd is mostly men from the nearby businesses- if you're a single lady looking for a nice guy with a good job, try stopping in here to pick up more than your lunch! ;)

Review Text :
The waitress/owner is the worst I have ever experienced.  Sure, her English is bad, but her attitude is worse.I went in with allergies/a cold after 3pm. yesterday evening, hoping to get a soup to comfort me.  She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table, even when lunch was technically over.She went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table.  She came back to my table and I wasn't ready.  It took her 10 minutes to return.  She turned up her nose at me, and began chatting (loudly) with the sushi chef.  My body language showed I was ready, but she came over when she was good and ready.I said that I wanted soup, and asked her for her recommendation, since I was feeling under the weather.  I guess she was disappointed in my order.  She refused to apply herself to the question, giving short, sharp answers, avoiding eye contact, and then stating, "Everyone is different," so a recommendation was not possible.  She left again for an extended period of time.  I had time to look around at the dirty carpet.  She brought no tea or water.I asked about the spring rolls; were they fried?  She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude.  "Excuse me?" I thought to myself, "Does Orient equate with Chinese?"I asked if she had ginger tea.  She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone, and I had better be okay with that!Finally I ordered the Miso soup.  It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough.  I asked for the tea twice, since it appeared she did not hear me.  She barked at me with the equivalent, "Alright already."  She plopped it on the table.  Later, when I was finished with my soup, she put her fingers all over the tea nossle.  That was effective in making me leave promptly.  Again, my body language communicated, "Check please!" but she chatted with the sushi chef, never letting him get a word in edgewise.I waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip.  I mumbled "Never again!" as I left, determined to never frequent this establishment, and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear.  As I drove around the back, the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner.I had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before.

Who knew?No seriously...Who knew this was here? Solid marketplace for on the fly Italian ingredients and a decent Italian beef sammie. Wish there was more space to eat than the two tables which practically feel outside given the draft, but I think this could quickly be a great grab-n-go option for me on that side of town.

Review Text :
Unlike many women, I don't really like shopping....that's why I was so happy to discover that Saigon Noodles is practically next door to West Towne Mall!  Food really motivates me so I won't mind shopping and grabbing some pho this winter.  Saigon Noodles is clean, nicely decorated, has a great menu, and their pho is pretty great.  I was disappointed that the difference in price between regular and large pho is pretty crazy....I highly recommend splashing out that extra $1 for twice as much pho!  The service here is pretty basic....nothing more than a "hi," "what do you want to order?" and "ready for the check?"....but you can't have everything!

We got one order of there cheese nachos which was AMAZING!! I have not had nachos in years so, this was a major decadent explosion of cheesy goodness that feed the deep rooted cheese addict in me.   I also ordered some sort of Cheese Chicken quesadilla though, it was called something else- It was A Thick fluffy tortilla, stuffed with thick chunks of chicken with again, the most incredibly flavorful cheese I literally have ever had, all with some superbly fantabulous guacamole on the side....needless to say, I felt the size of a super burrito when I left.This place really is addicting. I don't know what kind of flavor they add to there cheese though, it is any cheese lover's idea of heaven.The overall appearance of the restaurant is nothing fancy and just a typical Mexican chain joint , the service is probably a hit and miss though,  the food.....you just have to try.

I could see my reflection in the shiny floors. And I almost ran into a busboy while admiring myself, but dayum, them was some clean tiles!FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! Yes, the sandwich experts behind the counter were most polite and efficient. On the negativo side for PCDWell. The sandwich. Ugh. And that's why I"m there. Rye was dry. Pastrami was, um, well, what the hell ryhmes with pastrami. Um, oh, I know....pastrami was no a yummy...OK. I'm trying people. And the slaw. You know what I'm gonna say. The slaw...drum roll please.... WAS BLAH! As in bland. Not sweet. Not sour. Ugh.On the poz side for CPD....Well it's in New York baby! What else do you need?There's a surprisingly fabulous, modern patio at PCD. Seriously worth checking out for a "mall" establishment. I'll go back. Perhaps to try another deli delight. Or maybe to hurl my sandwich in the Koi pond. Even though the sign says not to feed the fish. HA! I'm de elited and a rebel biatches!!!!!And maybe, just maybe, I'll wear my I HEART NY t shirt.

Review Text :
Happily, we didn't experience the problems that we did at my birthday dinner here last year, probably because we went on a Tuesday night.  We were seated right at the edge of the lake, with a beautiful view of a full moon and Jupiter (thanks, Android app!).  We shared a bottle of the best Riesling ever, and also a warm spinach salad, with pancetta and a bread crisp spread with goat cheese - yum!Alas, the restaurant was out of the hanger steak that we - and every table around us - wanted to order.  The waiter said they hadn't gotten their meat delivery today as planned.  Instead, I had the Trout, which was served with a topping of crabmeat, haricots verts, and balsamic-soaked shallots.  It had way too much salt for my taste, but I was going to keep it anyway.  Instead, the waiter whisked it away, the owner, Jeff, came over and said that the kitchen would whip up a fresh one, with no salt at all added.  And they did, quickly!  Yes, the fish could have used a touch of salt, but not after I spread out that balsamic drizzle.  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband had the salmon, and it was also terrific.We had ordered - 30 minutes ahead, as required - the house special bread pudding with cinnamon sauce.  Two other tables had birthday celebrants, and they had the usual candle and Happy Birthday jingle sung.  My bread pudding was served sans candle, and no Happy Birthday song.  Instead, the waiter got down on one knee, took my hand, and serenaded me with a very professional rendition of "La Vie en Rose!"  Edith Piaf herself couldn't have done it better.  The icing on the cake, so to speak, was that the house comped my birthday dessert, even after we presented our restaurant.com certificate.  A far cry from last birthday's mess, when all the hassles and waiting produced nothing at all.  All in all, it was a terrific dining experience, a wonderful dinner, and we're not going to wait a whole 'nother year to return.One of the best off the strip restaurants I've been to in this town. What the exterior lacks in curb appeal (it's located in a dated strip mall with a non-descript facade) the interior more than makes up for it with a quaint, romantic atmosphere not found elsewhere in Las Vegas. It's two biggest selling points: a wine shop and a patio overlooking a lake.I love the wine shop! With several rows of wines displayed, there are plenty of varietals to choose and a wide range of prices for both the big spenders and the penny pinchers (I'm somewhere in between). So, after you check in at the host stand -- which is by the front door at the cash register -- peruse their wine selection and take it to the table with you. They'll just add the wine to your dinner check, plus a ten dollar corkage fee.There's a small indoor dining area, but the best place to sit is on their patio. During the winter it's enclosed and has heat lamps so you'll be able to dine there year-round. Don't expect a breathtaking view. We're not talking about one of the Great Lakes. It's in a desert, after all, so the body of water is fairly small. But the overall experience and atmosphere is one that is unique to the city.The food is very good. The menu is on the conservative side, with items that will be familiar to most everyone. It's French-inspired American food that's executed extremely well.The ahi and bacon app ($15) was a nice mix of flavors and textures with its pickled pineapple, glazed bacon, chive and chili oil. It's a small dish, with two seared slices of tuna and one thick cut of bacon, but tasty, nonetheless.For entrees my wife had the mushroom risotto ($18) -- a large and perfectly seasoned portion served in a shallow bowl. I went with the braised short rib ($28) -- a large, tender slab of beef sitting on a generous helping of blue cheese mashed potatoes and topped with crispy shallots. Neither dish stood a chance... we devoured both with nothing left behind.We ended the meal with a delicious bread pudding ($8) -- freshly baked to order and served with cinnamon rum sauce. Served in a large ramekin, it's good enough for three, maybe four people.The service was professional and courteous without being too overbearing. The prices were excellent. With our restaurant.com gift certificate we ended up paying about $130 total. That's a far cry from what we would normally spend on the Strip for a similar meal. With its decidedly anti-Vegas ambiance, this place is a hit for any special occasion.The best thing about this place is the view on the patio. I've never bought wine here, so this review has nothing to do with that part.I've been here a few times now, and I'm not impressed. The last time, I made a reservation for brunch for a party of 11 around 1pm. I wanted a nice relaxing scene for my friends the morning after my birthday party. The reasons I am not impressed with this place of business -The staff was not so pleasant. They seemed to be looking at our group with more of a "snotty" attitude and they seemed to not be very genuine. The waitress, Emily was not at all tentative. She seemed annoyed that we had a large group and she didn't ask to refill half of the groups drinks, took over 30 minutes just to ask what we wanted to order, drinks and food. We had to call out to her over 3 times just to get her attention. I don't ever see this being necessary.It literally took us 2 hours just to eat and pay. Only due to the fact that she did take care of us. It was not busy. She was not busy. If it was busy there, we all would have understood. I watched her as she tended to other tables and she was great with them. Not one person asked for a manager or complained to her, because the group does not like to cause a scene or  problems. The same group ate out 2 other times over the weekend, and we never had problems elsewhere. I never thought it would be a problem having a larger group there, due to being there at other times and seeing other large groups dining here. The food here has always been good. That is on the plus side. If you are picky about service, I have not had one amazing experience here. I've had decent service with just my boyfriend and I dining here. I always tip a minimum of 20%. If it's awesome service, I tip over 30%. I gave her the bare minimum of 15%, she honestly deserved less. I appreciate great service because I've been in this industry for over 10 years. I hope this restaurant sees this review and I hope they revamp their customer service. It doesn't matter what your group looks like (rich, middle class or poor), how large or small your group is, you should always be willing to provide the best service to all of your customers equally. Each person in the group was very disappointed with our service and I was embarrassed for bringing them here. We are not a rowdy or raggedy looking bunch. Just people who are happy to eat good food. No matter how good the food/view/ambiance is, if you have horrible service, it ruins everything.2.5 STARS ~!!!My boyfriend and I haven't really had time to celebrate our 2 year anniversary so this was kind of our 2 year & 2+ months anniversary dinner thing haha. I've had this place bookmarked for forever and it seemed like a good fit for us since we wanted something low-key and didn't want anything on the strip. I made reservations a couple weeks ago and requested a table right along the edge right by the water which is the only reason I chose this restaurant...I've worked in food and beverage so I know requests can't be guaranteed but they are still possible to grant with proper planning and especially if it is for a special occasion. When we got to the restaurant the hostess had 0 personality. Not even a smile, a welcome, a how are you, happy anniversary..nothing.. just borderline rudeness! I don't know if she was new but she seemed a little flustered. At that point a server came around and angrily asked her why she would seat a 6 top party with no menus.. and she mumbled something back.. IDK it was just a really weird start to the night and a bad first impression of the restaurant. We waited for 10 minutes or so for our table which was not a problem since you can kill time by looking around at their wine selection. We got seated and I was NOT happy with our table. It was small  and not to mention the farthest table from the lake on the patio. I had a view but my boyfriend didn't have any. UGH. Then looking at my menu I realized they gave me a brunch menu.. no one came to greet us or even fill our water glasses for 10 minutes. At this point I just wanted to leave... but my boyfriend was getting hungry and said we should just wait it out. Someone finally brought us water.. I asked the guy for a dinner menu and he never brought me one.. Then 15 minutes into us being seated I see 2 tables right by the lake finish and leave. If the hostess knew what the hell she was doing she would have had us wait at the bar so we could have been seated at the table I requested. But what ever.. at this point I just needed some wine badly. Finally our server came and took our orders. Apparently she had been there since noon which I had heard some other servers say too. So they are understaffed and most of their servers are tired. Our server was nice but half way through the meal I stopped seeing her so I'm assuming she left for the night... would have been nice if she told us she was leaving. The food was just OK here.. not bad but not amazing..if this food was being served at a restaurant that didn't have a view of a lake then I'm sure it wouldn't be doing as well. We ordered:-Bacchus Cheese & Charcuterie platter ($21) When the food runner dropped this off she started to tell us what was on it and then she stopped and said she forgot.. LOL wow it would have been nice to know what the hell we were eating but oh well.. It was nice to graze on with our wine.-Bread: Their bread basket was just some warm sliced ciabatta bread.. -Steak Frittes ($25) Decent steak with really crispy fries..-Crispy Maple Leaf Duck Breast ($30) It was good but I would have liked a more sweet glaze to go with it.. -In House Wine: You can just select a wine from the front store and bring it to your table and the server will add it on to the bill.. They charge $10 to whatever the retail price is.. Wines start at $15 ($25 in the restaurant)-Corkage fee: If you want to bring in your own bottle of wine there is a $25 feeI find it really funny that after they brought the bill to the table and after they ran my card they asked if we wanted dessert.. LOL In the end, I had an enjoyable night because I was with the man I love and the live flamenco player was a nice touch too.. but it also could have been due to the fact that we finished 2 bottles of wine so I was feeling good. but MAN Service I think is half of the experience of dining at a restaurant and this place sucked booooty in that department. If the service was good I would give Marche Bacchus 4 stars but it was just so BAD...I really am tempted to give it another go for brunch but I don't want to have to guzzle down 2 bottles of wine again just to enjoy my meal. HOT TIP: I have none. I hope the service is better for you.I came to this beautiful restaraunt for an event being held by Angela H.  Thanks for arranging it!  Marche Bacchus is on the complete opposite side of town from where I live.  But, I didn't come because of the atmosphere.  That was a bonus.  We were seated on the patio overlooking a lake which is the center piece of this community.  I also didn't come here because of the incredible service.  Our server was Vince, he was on top of everything.  He knew when to check in on us and take care of our needs.  Again, I didn't show up because of the extensive wine selection.  Nor, was it because of the brunch.  A decent egg, bacon, sausage and toast with a garnish of broiled tomatoes; is what I ordered.  The sausage was the star on the plate.  The reason I came was because of the people that I am becoming friends with.  They are worth the drive and everything else was just icing on the cake.  There were 20 of us and it was great building some new friendships.I've been wanting to come to Marche' for a long, long time. You won't ever run into this restaurant unless you go into the Desert Shores housing community so it's a hidden gem that some people may not even know is there. I did, because I tried unsuccessfully to buy a house here and got outbid at every corner.Angela H. put on a Sunday brunch UYE and we had prime patio seating for it. If it's nice out - take advantage of it! It's a shaded patio over looking the lake and has vines and potted plants giving a feel of being in someones lovely yard. It was busy, but not crowded in feeling and was a pleasant vibe for all of us to converse. I came late, but they were able to get my food out to me in a jiffy and our server was very pleasant. I had the buckwheat crepes with mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was pleasant and creamy and had to be sopped up with some bread, chicken was cooked right and I like the mushrooms were a mix of beech and oyster. The salad with it was a nice mix of greens with a hint of orange in the vinaigrette. I don't know why I haven't gone here sooner, but probably because my ego is bruised that I don't get to walk her from my backyard to brunch at the lake. I most definitely will be back as it's prime outdoor dining weather and the food was solid. I will be back for their weekday lunch special pre fixe as that seems like a great deal!There are several things I understand about dining out Mother's Day. Things are going to go wrong, be slow, and kitchens will crash and burn. I know this because I was the General Manager for 2 P.F. Chang's in town. I woke up every Mother's Day morning residing the fact that I will have to do some apologizing that day and I will do my best to address every issue and put out every fire. I will comp what I need to, and beg for forgiveness when someone's experience is ruined. My biggest complaint here is that at no time did any manger stop by to check on us. We sent back ice cold dishes, ticket times were absurd (2:15 dining time with kids) and a kid entrée brought out 20 minutes before anyone else got served (we did not request that). We had to get our desserts to go and left a 10% tip! With all of these GLARING RED FLAGS to management, not a single person stopped by to say anything, let alone apologize.  Once again, yes things will go wrong and yes management actually has the power and the obligation to recover the guest.  At what point does the manager at this restaurant step in? What other signs do they need? I will never ever be back on principal alone. Yes, the wine prices, food, and view are lovely, but not worth the incompetence of the management. Good Luck, you are going to need it. Brien McEahernWORST SERVICE EVERI hate giving bad reviews but there is no excuse for my experience. We came here for Mother's Day. Had a reservation set but didn't manage to be seated for over 30 minutes after our reserved time. Once we were seated we didn't see our server for over 10 minutes- this means we didn't even have water to sip on while we waited. Once we were given our water and menus- we didn't even have the chance to order for another 15-20 min as our server disappeared again. Long story short we finally ordered our food (took another hour or so before we received it), and they brought me the wrong thing. They "quickly" fixed it and got me the correct food. It was mediocre (at most) and I didn't even finish it. It looked/tasted like they gave me a dried out hamburger bun by wonder bread (you know... Hostess brand). When we got the bill they charged us for the incorrect order and we had to point it out to them. In all fairness they tried to right the wrong and took my item off as well as their required 18% gratuity. But even with the comp'd food, our bill was still over $200. Their desserts were amazing BUT definitely not worth $200 for a chocolate crunch. The entire dinner was 3 hours long. And it wasn't long because we finished eating and decided to talk. We were WANTING to leave but we hadn't even received out meal yet. Btw it wasn't that busy so I can't says "well it was a holiday and they were busy".  This place needs to get its act together as I've seen places like Olive Garden that are more organized and efficient than this place. And I refuse to eat at Olive Garden. I will NEVER return to this place. I wish the business best of luck and hope they learn from this experience so they may be better for the next customer who decides to eat here.Delicious food. Horrible service!! We arrived for our reservation at 1030 and were seated. They brought us water and took our drink orders. Drinks came and we didn't see anyone for 40 minutes! We had to go ask someone to come over to take our order. They didn't have someone over to take our order for another 15 minutes. Finally they took our order and it came out 20 minutes later. We asked for separate checks up front so there wouldn't be any confusion. Food on a Sunday brunch was delicious! I would go back for brunch anytime if the service wasn't so horrible! Halfway though our meal we asked for the check knowing it would take forever. It took them literally 45 minutes from the time our meals were cleared until our checks came. They told us they don't know how to do separate checks is why it is taking so long. Somehow they did it and everyone blamed it on everyone else. The manager blamed it on a slow computer and slow staff.Yikes. After quite a nice meal here two years ago, I organized a brunch for my mommy group and the service was really pretty bad:/We had a reservation for a party of 8 and after being sat waited 45 minutes to order, then subsequently had to wait and wait and wait each time we asked for so much as a refill on water. Twice a porter came to refill waters and then walked off with several of the glasses still empty- never to return with more water! We asked for our checks in the middle of the meal because we could foresee it being a looooooong wait, and unfortunately we were right.When the manager came over to ask how everything was, my friend mentioned that the service was really, really slow. He seemed surprised and eventually told us that it was because we needed separate checks. When we (nicely!) let him know that every aspect of the service had been slow, not just the check-getting portion, he mentioned the separate checks again and blamed our wait on an outdated computer system. When he came back 15 minutes later to find us still waiting he told us he had comped our bottomless mimosas due to the wait - which was nice of him! Only...none of us had had bottomless mimosas ($20), although 4 of the 8 had had single mimosas ($8). We all said thank goodness that we had ordered the singles, because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for a refill on the bottomless ones. I do understand that separate checks are not ideal (when I organize a group outing elsewhere in the future I will definitely remind everyone about bringing cash) but they can't treat separate checks like some sort of puzzling phenomenon that has never been encountered before. And the separate check situation just doesn't excuse the long waits and poor service in every other regard.Happy Father's Day 2013!!!The gurlpren took me here for Father's Day and I admit, I would have never found this place because it's located smack in the middle of a residential area.  We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view. As for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. This was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!

Entering thru a fine wine shop, you can pick up something reasonably price.  Then, proceed to your table.On the outdoor deck, you'll be treated to live music, and a spectacular view of the lake.  Although man made, you would never know.  Alas, I became fooled many of time.This is particular a good choice for a romantic evening, or comfortable and nice enough for a group of friends for an afternoon.  Delightful.I recommend the Steak Frites ($25), Moules Mariniere (mussels, $19), and the Roasted Chicken ($22).Wonderful, wonderful place.  Also, it is miles from the strip, and provides ample parking.I have been a patron of Marche' Bacchus for many, many years. I raved to my dear friend about the wonderful food, service and ambiance the restaurant had to offer and chose it especially for her birthday luncheon celebration. Geesh, was I let down and embarrassed.We started with a five minute wait at the door while the hostess leisurely rang someone up. She finally finished, acknowledged us and seated us outside in a corner, even though there were plenty of lakeside tables available. Not to start out on the wrong foot, we accepted the lackluster table and gazed through the cloudy, plastic, weather-tarp in front of us. I watched the Manager tip a heat lamp around for a while in an attempt to fix or light it.After ten minutes of being completely unacknowledged, the waiter finally came over and gave us water. Sunny Sunday brunch-server personality? Nope. Seemed tired and unmotivated to be there. I have seriously received better service at Macaroni Grill. Isn't part of the dinning experience and higher prices great service? Not this day.We ordered a cheese platter and waited 20 minutes for it to arrive. Luckily the busboy brought bread and butter and we snacked on that instead. It was fresh and very good. The cheeses were tasty, but the sampling was super-skimpy for the price. Since it took another 30 minutes to get our entrees (which were only salads), we ate the bread and asked TWICE for more (or a cracker) so we could pare it with the cheeses. Unfortunately, neither arrived.The most annoying part of the meal was the mimosas order. We each ordered one and received them promptly. We finished them before our cheese chunks were gobbled down, so we decided to order another to help us cope with the humor of being ignored. The server filled our half-empty glasses and took off. We assumed the OJ would be coming right behind him, but nope. Straight champagne for us. When I got the bill, I was horrified to see that the Sunday Brunch mimosas were endless. We each only got a glass and a half and were charged $40! I'm pretty upset about that.MB used to be so delicious and set a certain standard for locals who know where to go to find the "good" restaurants. New owner? New manager? Not sure what happened, but I seriously felt robbed when I left the restaurant. I would have talked to the manager, but I was so frustrated by the time we left, I decided it would just be better to bite the bullet. So disappointed!!!!!Stopped in for lunch on a gorgeous day so we sat outside in the patio area overlooking the lake. You'll see swans, turtles, and ducks in the lake if you come during the day. Makes you feel like you've just escaped Vegas for a second. The restaurant  has an impressive selection of wines that you can choose from. The food was fantastic. We had the beef carpaccio which was tender and very flavorful. The Escargot... only because we felt like it was the "french" entree to order..no regrets! The steak tartar was also very good but nothing special. For dessert, we had the bread pudding and beignets. Both delicious but the bread pudding definitely out-shined the beignets. The ambiance is surreal...very romantic. Overall I could not have asked for a more enjoyable lunch. Great food, lakeside seating, and classical french music playing. I can't wait to come back.I was shocked to find out I have not reviewed Marche Bacchus prior.  I have been a regular here for years and guess I have always forgotten to submit a review. Having said that, it is well over due and deserving of my reserved 5 Star rating.  The service, scenery and setting is deserving of 4 stars alone, but the food pushes it on to 5 stars.My most recent visit was just for a quick lunch, but we enjoyed ourselves so much we ended up spending a few hours just enjoying the scenery and ambiance.  The staff is very friendly and efficient without being over bearing and ever present.  I haven't tried everything on the menu as of yet, but everything I have tried has more than satisfied.If you are looking for a quiet place for lunch, or a romantic setting for dinner you can't miss with Marche Bacchus.This is one of my favorite restaurants in Summerlin. I first went here about 3 years ago for restaurant week right after I moved to Las Vegas and it has been a staple ever since.First, the atmosphere/ambiance at this restaurant is totally different from most other places in the area. Summerlin is a planned community and as such it follows the same pattern as every other suburb on the planet- every 6 blocks there is a strip mall with a Best Buy and a Chilis. Most restaurants are chains and look exactly the same as every other restaurant in the country. Not so Marche Bacchus- it is an incredible place with an awesome view of the lake. It is an excellent place to take your special lady friend or anyone else you want to impress with your faux sophistication (second best place- Buffalo Wild Wings). Second, I have always found the service to be exceptional. The staff strike the perfect middle ground between ignoring you and being overly needy/explaining a million things you didn't ask about. Notes on specific dishesFrench Onion Soup- not exactly rocket science to prepare, but that doesn't stop the Outbacks of the world from ruining a classic. This is great- very rich and no unnecessary flavorsSteak tartare- something you can pretty much get anywhere now a days but few are as goodCreamy Polenta- I love polenta so this is something I get frequently. The mushrooms make it less of a one note side dish and more of an appetizer. Veal- my absolute favorite. It always comes so tender and perfectly seasoned.Beef Tenderloin- the red wine sauce on this is amazing. I'm not usually a beef tenderloin person but I love this.C'est magnifique! I was really blown away by the food at Marché Bacchus!  I'm mad at myself that it took me so long to go and try this place out.  So many missed meals are running through my head right now.  Here were the highlights:1. The food was amazing and easily 5 stars!  We tried a lot of things and everything we ordered was super tasty and tummy pleasing!  The meal started for both us us with French Onion Soup.  We each got our own because my hubby knows I don't share French Onion Soup with anyone!  The soup was fantastic! It is easily in my top 5 of all time.  This is saying a lot because I have been to France and ate a lot of French Onion soup while visiting.My hubby had the wine braised beef and it was really very good.  A knife wasn't even needed to cut the meat because it would just fall apart on it's own.  It was packed with flavor and really was yum-tastic.  I went with the classic Steak Frites, because it is really one of my go to entrees.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was served with a delicious herb butter that was melting all over it.  The frites or french fries were some of the best I have ever eaten in my life, and i know a thing or two about french fries! To top it off, it came with the most fabulous Béarnaise I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  If it wasn't such a nice spot, I might have licked the ramakin clean because it was that yummy! My hubby got Tiramisu for dessert.  I'm not a Tiramisu fan, so I can't say much about it, however the hubs said it was delightful!2. The atmosphere is beautiful.  The restaurant is set right on one of the lakes in Desert Shores.  You can't beat waterfront dining, especially in the middle of the desert.  I almost forgot that we were in Las Vegas, which makes for a great evening out.  Great great great location!3. The staff was all very friendly.  Everyone we encountered was smiling, happy, friendly, and helpful.  Yay for happy people!So with all of this good stuff, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  There were a couple of snafus that made them lose a star.  Here they are:1. We made reservations ahead of time.  I had mentioned it was our anniversary and we would like nice table.  When we got there, the hostess made a big deal of only having one table left and having to squeeze us in.  The table we got was up against the wall.  The floor around us had some broken glass as well.  It seems to have been missed during a clean up effort, but we could easily see it.  There was also several tables wide open for the entire time we were there right next to the water.  I guess we weren't special enough for those seats.2. The servers were all super nice, but stretched thin.  When we had our server, she was awesome.  The problem was we had to wait long periods in-between visits because she was so busy.  I don't mind a leisurely dinner, but this was a bit extreme.  Luckily we had made over night babysitting arrangements, otherwise we would have had to leave well before we were done with dinner.So the food is awesome, the locale is beautiful, and it is a great place for a nice night out, just make sure you booked your babysitter for an extra hour or 2.I Hate long reviews, but I wanted to share my most recent experience here:Went to have lunch last Saturday and BOY what a waste of time and money. I've been coming here for years and I know that it is a hit or miss most of the time. It was packed, which is fine, they were setting up for large parties, but we were severely neglected (even though we were one of like 7 tables seated). Our server looked like she was having the WORST day of her life, and I don't resent her for it, who know what's what. We ordered Bloody Marys, which were basically shrimp cocktail sauce in a glass. I get using some horseradish in the mix, but the consistency and the flavor intensity was just straight up cocktail sauce. So disappointing because my man and I came a little hungover and were really looking forward to it. My pet peeve in restaurants is when stuff is sent out without anyone checking the food or doing a drink taste test. UGH!!! I had a french onion soup. It came with a large crouton with cheese on top of it. It was extremely inconvenient to eat, I was struggling with that big chunk of bread, glued to the cheese for a while. Tasty though. I'd really recommend dropping a piece of toasted bread in the soup and baking the cheese over the bowl, it's what French Onion Soup is ALL about, the cheese factor! I mean Google the thing for F sake and you will see many amazing ways of presenting this awesome dish! The bf had a blue cheese burger. He eats red meat like once in a year and was looking forward to it. Medium rare.... came out well done, extra dry and there was a very conservative drop of blue cheese on there. Meh. I had a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. First bite was like biting into smelly fish. The turkey was completely spoiled. I thought it was just me (because of the night before), the bf did a taste test and we sent it back. There was no significant reaction from the server, like AT ALL. And 20 min later she comes by and says "I'll take that off the bill for ya okaaay?" Like she was doing us a favor. We both looked at her and said "uhh... yeah, you will!" We noticed other patrons sending food back and the owner did absolutely nothing about coming over and talking to the guests or making apologies. Every time I see him, he just strikes me as a huge huge douche. And knowing this place (and many people who have worked here) he is and so is his wife. No wonder there is no enthusiasm in this place and why their employee turnover is so high. Shame.Do yourself a favor, skip lunch and have a dinner here. Service will always be total sh*t, but it's great atmosphere for you and your love and if you stick to perhaps the cheese plate, the muscles and other simpler items, you will not be disappointed.Let me first start out with my gripe and get it off my chest so I can move on with my life (just kidding, kinda). So I made reservations about 6 weeks prior to Bastille Day, for brunch, we had a group of 10, so I wanted to make sure I gave plenty of notice (I'm a planner). I arrive the day of, led out to the patio area, and the hostess says, I'm so sorry, I thought we had the table ready. So I'm led to another area of the patio and seated. It's July 11, and when I made the reservation, I wasn't anticipating sitting outside, so I didn't bother requesting inside. I see there are quite a few people outside, and they had fans going, so I decided to toughen up and enjoy it (I love outside dining, just not when it's 108 degrees out). As we are sitting there, the misters would shoot on for 2 seconds and shut off, I asked our waitress if there was any way they could leave them on, she said they "were working on it". As the table is sitting there, all of us are dressed up, we are all dripping with sweat and having a hard time enjoying ourselves. As we are leaving, the hostess apologizes for the heat and asked us "did your waitress tell you what happened" we said no, she said a customer had decided to try and redirect one of the misters directly on him and it broke the entire system, the hostess then followed it up with "your waitress should've offered to move you girls inside". Little late now. Also, I had a restaurant.com voucher that I attempted to use, if anyone is familiar with those, they are very specific on the voucher about day, times, etc about when you can use them. My voucher only stated not valid on alcohol. So, they would not accept my voucher because they said their system is only set up to accept the vouchers for dinner (does not state this anywhere) the mgr claimed he has been meaning to contact them to correct it. That's my rant. The food. Our brunch was amazing. Every single dish. A few stand outs were, French Toast, Lobster Salad Croissant and of course the Croque Madame. The Creme Brûlée was delicious, I attempted to get the bread pudding, but they were out of vanilla ice cream, and the waitress tried talking me into subbing mango ice cream instead, which sounded terrible together. I enjoyed my food enough to overlook the service issues we had and to come back and dine again.Shame on me for not reviewing MB yet!This gem is on the water (yes, a an actual, albiet man-made, water-way in Las Vegas) in Summerlin. Be sure to sit on the patio and be ready to feel as if you aren't in our beautiful desert climate. On your way out you can peruse their wine shop and pick out a bottle to accompany dinner. I like my bubbles, so insisted on champagne and a bottle of white.I wasn't as impressed with the live music/entertainment as some other Yelpers. I think live music is very important to ambiance but my preference would have been a talent like Daniel Park or perhaps a straight acoustics musician. The man there this was a bit off his game (maybe he was sick?)Anyway, on to the food! We ordered:French Onion SoupDuck Confit Salad (Favorite!)ParpadalleWhite fish (special du jour)There is no question that I will be back soon. MB is a nice alternative to the glitz of dinner out on the Strip.

Jimmy John's....why did it take so long for me to find you?  I've heard so much about this place and for some reason have never eaten at one of there joints until the other day.After browsing the menu, I opted for a #5 Vito Italian Sandwich (Genoa Salami, Provolone, Capicola, Onion, Lettuce, Tomato & Italian Vinaigrette) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips & Soda.....another Soda Fountain got to me....they have Mello Yello Soda here....never tried it before, so I had to give it a shot.The Sandwich was made really fast, they handed me the Sandwich while I was paying for the food....wow!  I anxiously unwrapped the Sandwich and was pleased to see a large Sandwich.  As soon as I took the first bite, I became an instant fan.  The Italian Bread was soft and was definitely the highlight of the Sandwich.  The Meats and toppings were very good too, but the Bread made this Sandwich special.  It was doughy and went well with the Meat, Italian Vinaigrette and Veggies.....it some ways it reminded me of the Subs/Grinders I've had on the East Coast.Will I return?  You can count on it!Have been here at least 5 times since my last review.  Since then I've discovered the #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinagrette, $5.75) and add Hot Peppers $.25.I can't get over how fast they make Sandwiches here....seriously, it takes them like 1 to 2 minutes max.  The Italian Club Sandwich has become my new favorite......it's full of flavor and filling.  I love the Hot Peppers....wish I could buy them at the store to take home.  The proportion of meat, cheese, and ingredients is perfect.  This is becoming one of my favorite Sandwich joints.Return Factor - 90%If you want a sandwich that'll make your blood pressure go up, this is the place for you. This is the location close to my office and so if I want something quick without having to drive, I end up giving them a call. For the past few years, they've been good at making my blood boil...and I keep giving them a chance. "Jimmy will change"...NO! Keep dreaming!Ordering on the phone is quite painful as their order takers can't hear. "It's too loud in the store" yet I don't hear background noise. Investing in a good phone might help. When they write your credit card number/ name/  address/ phone number - they can never get it right. "We tried calling you multiple times because your credit card won't go through." It helps if you call the right number and most credit cards have 16 digits. This leads to not having a receipt for you.There were times I had to wait a long time for a delivery when it's only a 2-minute drive away. "The driver got lost"...really? GPS for less than half a mile?However, I do like their sandwiches better than say Quizno's or Subway. I normally get: Bootlegger's Club, Hunter's Club, Turkey Tom. You have the option to just have the meat and bread (Slims) or not have the bread at all (Unwich).Yes.  Quality and Clean.  JJ's trumps Subway for sure.  This location is perfect if you're at work, at school or a hospital near by.  Good prices and from what I understand they have delivery that's freakishly fast.  Good food in a pinch.

Review Text :
It seems as though good sausage is a way to my heart...or so my doctor tells me. But enough about me, this is all about a fantastic Phoenix gem that I would have never known of had it not popped up on my Yelp app one Sunday afternoon; this is about Caffe Sarajevo.This Bosnian dive is home to a seemingly authentic menu, and an atmosphere that made me feel like I left Phoenix for lunch. As with any ethnic dive, I expected service to be absolute crap or absolute gold...the service I got was gold! I walked in with the girlfriend into a small dining area filled with customers speaking words that I couldn't understand while laughing and having a great time enjoying their food and company. We were immediately greeted and asked to sit wherever we'd like by a server who was smiling and very welcoming. After we sat down, he came over and was awesome enough to go over most of the menu with us, explaining each of his favorite things in perfect detail. - If you know me, you know I like dives... Also, if you know me, you know I love asking for recommendations, and love hearing those recommendations with enthusiasm. -  I was in heaven, and completely excited when we decided on the Cevapi (the sausage sandwich), the Pljeskavica (a beef patty sandwich), a Sirnica (cheese puff pastry) and some freshly made Turkish coffee...And here we go:I love coffee, especially strong, rich coffee with real flavor. Lemme tell ya, if you're looking for some good caffeinated mud, look no further. Just great. While waiting for the main dishes, we shared the Sirnica, which had just come out of the oven! It was literally a hot mess and filo doughLICIOUS! As far as those sammiches, we didn't want to stop mowing through them! The Cevapi was served with a couple sauces and raw onion, and the sausage was a mix of lamp and cow. Mix those all together on some freshly baked Bosnian bread, and...Yum! The Pljeskavica was a patty on the same bread, but had more of a lamb flavor to me than a beef. It was also yum, especially since it was covered in cheese and mushrooms!!Holy hell, I've gone on long enough. The food was great. The service was great. The people were all great. I'm such a fan. I love dive restaurants. I love ethnic food, and now, I love Bosnian food.There's no better way to have your first Bosnian cuisine than having a true-blooded Bosnian for company. He speaks the language, ordered for us, and knows if the food is authentic and not watered-down for the American palette. WHY GO THERE? My Bosnian friend gave this restaurant the thumbs-up seal of approval. The food is  good, he had a box to go for the next day.WHATCHAGOT? For starters, we ditched the hearty soup and went for bread. We had all three pitas: meat, cheese and spinach. While each was delicious and warmed up, it would have been better to have them early in the day when they're made fresh. Traditionally, you grab the end by hand and uncoil the bread, as you work your way to the center. Best shared. The cevapi is filling. I find the large too much, I could have settled for a medium or small. I asked about the raw onions. My friend said it is a cure for everything. Have an ailment, eat the raw onion! I guess it's apples for Americans, onions for Bosnians!We wrapped dinner with an addictively sweet and delicious tulumbe. Better than baklava!YOU GOT SERVED.Service is quick and friendly, but in a take-your-time-when-you're-ready-to-order kind of way. I like it better than the methodical service of chain restaurants. Overall, the Turkish and Greek influences are very much present in Bosnian cuisine. If you like Turkish, you'd like Bosnian food. Geez, that sounds like the perfume ad of the 80's.I checked out this place for the International Supper Club UYE.  I love checking out food from around the world, in the US and in it's native land.  So, this was cool.  I've never been to Bosnia.  I wondered what the food could be like because Bosnia is a literally cultural melting pot with Mediterranean, European and Middle Eastern influences.  I was eager to give it a try and see if any of those 3 cultures dominated the influence on the food.  You might drive past the tiny shopping plaza in which this restaurant is located.  Why you ask?  Because it is about as nondescript as a traffic light, except you pay attention to the traffic light.  It's also a rather run down plaza and is not attractive.  No worries, pull in to that parking lot and yeah, you'll look around like, "where is Ursula sending me.....?????"  Seriously, go inside.  You'll quickly realize that you've escaped the ho' hum and entered eastern Europe.   The inside of that restaurant is so neatly decorated, you feel like you're in eastern Europe.  Fortunately, I was with a great group of yelpers.  I teamed up with Preston S to split our entrees.  He ordered the Pljeskavica and I ordered the Cevapi.  Both of these items are served on the tastiest, flakiest, buttery pastry type bread I've had in quite some time.  The Pljeskavica was a 4-star item with a the beef patty, mushrooms and cheese on that flaky pastry-like bun.  I would order this item again!  The Cevapi was somewhat like a kabob, but really reminded me of Jimmy Dean Breakfast sausages in appearance.  But NOT in taste.  These small sausages are made of beef and lamb and are seasoned with Bosnian spices.  This was a 3-star item for me.  If I ever get back over there, I MUST try the burek.   I have a feeling that I will enjoy that immensely!  Unfortunately, any place that serves dinner, but not wine generally gets a one-star-off from me.  This could have been a 4-star review from me!  I wonder if you can do a BYOB.  I have to keep in mind that no booze could be a religious choice as well.  so I'm giving them a 3.5 instead of taking the whole 1 star.  I always bump 3.5 star reviews to 4 stars.This place is like getting in a time machine and going back in history. Somebody has spent a great amount of energy decorating the inside of this place like an old fashion Bosnian town. Tons of intricate wood work and detail to add just that right amount of fun and authenticity.Came here after seeing the International Supper Club pig out at one of their UYE parties. They always pick great places and food that is unique and tasty. I can confirm all of the above with a smile.The menu here is rather small but filled with several different types of Bossian specialties. Usually get one of the Cevapi/Bosnian Sausage Sandwiches. There are three different sizes depending on how hungry you at the moment. Also have tried the tasty Pljeskavica/Beef Patty with mushrooms and cheese.Service is friendly and helpful. On my first visit the owner and server were getting ready to eat lunch. They were more than happy to share some of the treats that they were having with me. She said it was a potato version of the cheese pita that they make. Nice!You know it is good when you can hear people speaking a language that you are not accustom to hearing. Sometimes they can get a little loud and passionate in their discussions. Gives you that intimate feeling like you are there with them and in the zone. Overall the food is very good and worth checking out. There are several other dishes that I want to try on my next visit. Still need to also check out the desserts. Good thing my job has me in the area a couple times a month. Meet me for lunch if you can. CHEERS!4.25 STARS

Carrabba's just flat out sucks.  Growing up north next to all good italian food, there were times where I will still stop in Carraba's.  It always felt like a step above chain restaurants and the food seemed to almost be on the level of a cheesecake factory.  Not so much anymore.  I rather go to Chile's than eat this mess again.  We started with the mixto appetizer ( i know that is not the name ) with the calamari, bruschetta, and mozzie stix.  This was the only thing decent other than the 1 Beer and 1 wine we had.  For the entrees we had the frozen lobster ravioli and the filet covered in goat cheese.  There was more goat cheese than steak and the steak was pretty rare.  Normally I would be all about this, but for such a shitty cut of meat the only thing saving this thing was the goat cheese.  When i recieved my bill for $93 after feeling like my food was  a step below applebee's I wish i had gone somewhere else like Mama Ricottas where I would get 100xs better food and even at a cheaper rate.  Carrabba's what happened to you?  I used to love you and now I know to just 500 ft away like I have a restraining order against you.

I'm so glad Kabul is back, and, from the large crowd present during a recent visit, the rest of Madison is as well. The new space is nice, with a large bar in the middle and a lot of seating. It's unfortunate it cannot be on the street level where it would be more visible, but I hope the great reputation and following keep it busy.The food is as wonderful as always, Middle Eastern with a unique Afghan twist. We have loved this staple of Madison for years and were saddened when they were temporarily closed for a forced relocation when their building was torn down. One of the things we love most about the Madison food scene is the ability to find tastes from around the globe. Chinese, Thai, Greek and other unique flavors can be found in most mid to large cities, but Afghan food is something more difficult to find. Plus, they are often open on Christmas and other holidays, which makes it a great place to visit when no one else is open.Portions are generous, seasonings are to perfection. I feel like I'm eating healthy when I dine here since someone actually makes the food from scratch rather than buying pre-made versions from a wholesaler. I'm a big fan and look forward to returning.

Restaurant name  Buffet @ Asia

Review Text :
During numerous trips to Vegas, I've frequented the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow Blvd. (My review of that place here: (http://www.yelp.com/biz/buffet-at-asia-las-vegas-4#hrid:mSPf88mhq76t49Qo-3jtlw). In the sea of Vegas buffets, Buffet at Asia is one of the best ones in my opinion for Asian food. On my latest Vegas trip however, I got to try for the first time to the Buffet at Asia in the Henderson area.The setup of this Buffet at Asia is a little bit different from the one on the westside. This one has one long row of food items that starts with a Mongolian wok type cookery. Next up is their sushi items and then this is followed by the soups: wonton, miso and seafood soup. Up next is the traditional Asian buffet food: they have good offerings like egg rolls, egg foo young, orange chicken, chicken skewers, dumplings and veggie tempura. Off to the side is their desserts: some items are orange jello, almond jello, chocolate mousse, frozen yogurt and sesame balls. I like how above the food items are big, bright lights and letters showing the name of the different areas. So very Vegas picturesque ;)They do offer some food that the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow doesn't have. It was the first time I saw these chicken with cheese wontons that I really liked. I did think however that the selection over at the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow is larger. This branch at Henderson had good food offerings but not as many as the westside location. Nevertheless, the food here is a good and if in you are in Henderson, it's a good place to go to. It's less than $10 and includes a drink!DO NOT COME HERE! I don't know what sucks more: their non existent service or their food. The food:Let's start off with the best thing there: honeydew. I should have just ate honeydew the whole time because everything else sucked. Don't even bother getting their sushi....it's just California roll with sauce on top or presented differently. Their seafood soup or whatever tasted very fishy. The pineapples looked like they had been sitting out for too long. Idk the food was just a huge mess. I felt like I only ate their veggie tempura, baked sweet potato and honey dew the whole time because everything else sucked. And as for the veggie tempura, it wasn't even good, but it was one of the better food options. Thank god they didn't fail on baking the sweet potato or else idk how and why they are still open. The service:We asked for napkins like literally 5 times and the waitresses had attitude. We also asked for hot tea and they put the hot tea in a plastic cup. Wait hold up? Have these waitresses not gone thru some type of food handlers training? Even if they didn't, do they not have common sense? Because you know it's common sense to not put hot drinks in plastic cups. Omg. They need to throw these waitresses back into kindergarten cus clearly they hired dumbasses. They also don't know how to own a business because the customer should always be right. We asked for the hot tea to be poured into a mug, but the waitress said the mug is for coffee only. Like wtf?! Are you stupid? Sigh.The city/county health inspector really should visit this place!$15 bucks a person for this slop is an outrage! Took my teen son here tonight as we were both hungry, both enjoy Chinese food and didn't feel like cooking...what a mistake to dine here!The restaurant is dirty...floors look they haven't been mopped in weeks, the ceiling fans I saw had dust attached to them ready to fly into somebody's food, the men's restroom mirror was filthy and out of hand soap.The food was plentiful...however most of it looked and tasted dried out because it was sitting so long and/or soggy because it was sitting so long it clumped together in a mush. The chunks of beef had a spoiled taste to it, despite it being cooked. It's as if it was old meat that was starting to smell/rot because of spoilage and they cooked it last minute to try and push it off on customers. It was titled "steak."The ribs were undercooked. The orange chicken was clumped together like a mush. The mushrooms were so soft it was like drinking mushroom soup instead of the nice crunch. same thing with the string beans, mushy and no crunch. The sushi area and desserts area should've been roped off with yellow caution tape!The utensils on our table had to be sent back as they had food crusted on them, despite them being wrapped in a napkin as if they were clean and ready for use. Noticed severs wiping tables with a washrag that was first used to wipe the booth seats...do they not understand the concept of cross contamination?The restaurant was so warm inside I was sweating, while wearing a pair of shorts and tshirt. See my photos of the thermostat....86 F inside, really? It was so uncomfortably hot in there that I left hungry just to escape to cool off in my air conditioned car.  but before we made it to the front door, we saw a TV/computer monitor by the front door showing over 20 mini screens of the surveillance cameras (eye in the sky) that appear just about everywhere on the ceilings throughout. What are they in fear of...somebody is going to steal their fortune cookies or chopsticks? My suggestion is to trade in the fancy surveillance cameras as nobody wants your umteen bags of white rice and invest in air conditioning and education on cleanliness. One star is a gift for the nice lady who earned herself a $2 dollar tip for filling our sodas twice.

Restaurant name  How Lee Chinese Food

Review Text :
My roommate has been trying to make me go here for the longest time swearing by their food. I don't know what took me so long, but I believe that this is the best Szechuan restaurant in the greater Pittsburgh area. I went with my boyfriend to top off a rather exhausting day. We ordered spicy beef tendon, Chongqing lazi chicken, and spicy eggplant and garlic. I don't even know why we ordered that much food because in all honesty we weren't that hungry. Keeping this in mind, once our food came out we devoured all of it. It did take a few hours but we did it. Perhaps the only thing I would change would be the amount of sauce that covered the eggplants, the eggplants were practically submerged. I usually like my eggplant with a lighter amount of sauce. The place was a bit pricier but the portions made up for it- the chef covered the whole surface of the plate. The service wasn't the greatest, but they were nice enough.I was bummed out from the very start of this meal.  I went to dine at How Lee's around 12:30pm and to my dismay they were only serving the lunch menu.  I ordered the shrimp and scallops which was served with a soup I choose the wanton soup.  My shrimp and scallops came out a little too fast like no sooner had my choice left my lips did the food arrive at my table.  There were literally only 3 other patrons in the restaurant and I don't know why the chef felt the need to nook my food.  I can get better tasting and more freshly prepared Chinese food from China Taste on East Ohio Street. My star rating can potentially go higher after I have had an opportunity to sample How Lee's dinner menu.This is one of my fav Chinese takeout joints in the 'Burgh. Don't judge, but I'm an Americanized Chinese kinda gal. This place also has an authentic Sichuan menu along with their Americanized menu. I'd really like to try some authentic food, but I'm so freaking addicted to their General Tso's chicken that when it comes time to order, I often can't resist the lure of my ol' reliable. Oh General Tso's, why can't I quit you? Crispy breaded chicken, tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy sauce, a couple of pieces of fresh broccoli thrown in for good measure...General Tso's, you please me so.I've also had a few other standard "Ameri-Chinese" things from their menu (egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, broccoli with brown sauce, lo mein, orange chicken, etc. etc.), and all are quite tasty and what you would expect from a quality Chinese takeout place. I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore, but when I did, their delivery speed was always stellar. Now I do mostly takeout, and even during their busiest times, they always have my order ready when they say they will.Bonus points: They let you sub brown rice for white for a small upcharge, which helps trick me into thinking that my meal is not going straight into my arteries (but who are we kidding, it totally is).Someday I hope to try to some of their more authentic offerings if I can break free from the grip of General Tso.

I truly hate to give a bad review to a neighborhood place that I've been to many times before.  But tonight's dinner was unbearable.We usually order kebab - chicken for my husband, and kafta or chicken for me.  But tonight we decided to shake things up, and the coupon did us in.  There was one from one of the mailers offering two dinners for $14.95.  Kebabs wasn't one of the choices, but Chicken Shawarma was.  How different could it be from Chicken Kebab, which we've always liked???Step 1:  Call to order for take-out.  Kid on the other end: "I'm not sure we have enough rice left for two dinners."  It's 8:15; they close, I think, at 10.  Puts me on hold for quite a while.  Finally:  "Yes, we do."  So I order them, with one vinaigrette and one creamy for the salad dressings.  Five minutes and it'll be ready.  No prob, we live close by.Hubby's sick, so I pick up the food.  Back home, I open my container to see the usual yellow rice, pickled cabbage and turnips, chopped raw red onion, the usual hard, dried-out pita, and a whole mess of dried and shriveled chicken pieces.  I taste one of them;  first I choked on the dryness, then my mouth shriveled from the salt - so much of it that two pieces and my lips were stinging as if I were doing a dead man's float in the Dead Sea.  It was completely inedible.It was when I noticed that the salads - fresh romaine, two slices of cuke, and one lonely grape tomato - came with not one, but two vinaigrettes.  No creamy for me.  I was then completely pissed and called the restaurant.  Got the same kid who'd taken my order, and asked to speak with the manager.I was put on hold twice - the second time for a verrrryyyy long time.  How big is this tiny place that he can't find the manager??  Finally the clerk gets back on to tell me that the manager isn't there, and he doesn't have the authority to issue any refunds.  But the manager will call me later this evening, if not, then tomorrow.  He didn't call tonight, so I'm waiting until late tomorrow afternoon to post this review.  I suspect that I will have waited for nothing.Well, I was right to wait.  I never heard from Sultan's Grill.  I had planned to give this meal two stars, because I do like the chopped veggies and the salad (when I have the dressing I ordered).  But I believe that a food business shouldn't be in the business of selling inedible food, and if they do, they have a duty to respond to complaints.  I'm not even asking for a free meal, just an acknowledgment that they dropped the ball.  A business that does not do this doesn't deserve any stars, so I've revised my rating downward.

Restaurant name  Michael's Pizza Bar & Restaurant

Review Text :
This is a review I didn't ever want to write.  This place is just too good. You know, pizza is something we all have a standard against which all others are measured. And the search for that perfect pizza is much like the search for the fountain of youth - elusive but clearly worthwhile. Michael's has restored my faith that perhaps that fountain of youth does exist - the perfect pizza certainly does! And Michael's has it! Sure, there's good pizza all over the place. But there's only one BEST pizza. I've had pizza all over Pittsburgh, all over the US (NYC, Chicago, SoCal...) and all over Europe including Italy. I've had Monte Cello's VIncent's, Domenico's, Luciano's, Mineo's, and all the chains - although I do like Piccolo Forno's too. My search has not been half-hearted nor without focus. I stumbled upon Michaels about 8 years ago and hit the motherlode. When I want pizza, I'm willing to drive the 25 miles from the north hills to the south side just to sit and enjoy my favorite pizza with a pitcher of Yuengling in a comfy bar atmosphere.I wanted to keep this place to myself, not to tell anyone about it. After all, hidden gems are meant to remain hidden, right? Otherwise people swarm in and spoil a good thing. No one wants to go somewhere where everyone goes!! But alas, I find myself after 8 years of going here as a regular, finally wanting to shout it out!! THIS IS GREAT PIZZA!!! Two blocks off Carson street on Sarah, it's off the beaten path and is not a place you're likely to just happen upon. You have to look for it. But once you do, you'll be hooked. First off, the crust is perfect, not too thin, not thick and doughy. It's a delight. The sauce is what make it. One thing I know it's sauce. And this is remarkable. Order the twisty's as an appetizer - parmesan dusted baked dough twists that are to die for - and you'll get a side of the sauce. Go ahead, dip in. You'll thank me. I could eat a bowl of that sauce with a tablespoon. And ask for more. This pizza just kills!! And if Meghan is working there, you'll be treated to the best service with a smile. She is absolutely the best. Good pizza, good service, good beer, good atmosphere. I call that JACKPOT!! What more could you want? If I have to wait for a table next time, I'll know I should have kept this secret to myself!!We decided to try Michael's Pizza Bar & Restaurant one sunny Saturday this past summer.  A little off the beaten path running through the South Side you will find this little treasure.  First impressions, it's a quaint neighborhood bar.  The kind of place that if you live close you probably frequent.  I was really excited to try Michael's after hearing about their pizza. So that is where we laid our attention.We ordered a large pie half cheese (for him) and the other half mushroom, onions, and banana peppers (for me).  Now I am like every other red blooded American, but pizza doesn't usually impress me.  It's ok, great to eat with beer, but I could never eat it regularly.  When I get pizza I like it to be thin crust, crisp, almost stand on its own, with veggies.  That being said Michael's delivered not only a pretty chill atmosphere but a pretty tasty pie.  Matt really liked the crust and the sauce.  I enjoyed the flavors as well, especially since they do not skimp on the toppings at all.  There was a plethora of veggies piled atop my pie.  This was good but came with its own set of challenges as the toppings weighed the pizza down, so there went my stand on its own factor.  That was ok it was still very scrumptious.  The one thing I really wish they would have done was use fresh mushrooms and not the canned ones.   Funny thing happened as we were eating and enjoying some brews.  A couple with a few kids pulled up outside.  They left the door of their SUV open as their kids slept in the car while they had some pie at the outdoor table.  I laughed cause I would totally do the same thing.

El Pollo Loco FREE Chicken for Mothers Day http://bit.ly/BymAs , http://bit.ly/nlKUm , http://bit.ly/nzgPuDining in at a fast food restaurant is not something I enjoy, but it I will do it from time to time when taking the food to go just won't do. This location is pretty busy and on the few occasions I have dined here, it gets loud and a little hard to hear your own thoughts, much less the conversation form your dining companion. The food is that of any other El Pollo Loco and they keep the place relatively clean with a well stocked salsa bar.

Review Text :
Oh this place!  I wanted to like it, I really did! I had heard good things from a few friends.  I also felt guilty I hadn't been there since I lived so close to it!  Me and a group of friend went there.  At the very beginning of the meal they pretty much tell you service will be VERY slow.  They weren't kidding! I assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food.  It wasn't just food we waited for though!  We waited for drinks, bread an even silverware!  The server was no where to be found at times.I would have forgiven all this if my food was amazing BUT it was far from it!  I'm very judgmental of Italian being that I am a proud Italian myself!  I ordered past vodka.  It was not the creamy delish sauce I expected, it was runny tastelessness!  My friend tried the regular spaghetti and the sauce tasted like it was from a spaghetti-o can.  Everyone agreed their meals left much to be desired.  Again, I really wanted to like this place, but after a 3 1/2 hour overpriced unappetizing meal I could no longer like the place!After a bad experience at TGI Fridays, my boyfriend and I decided to check out more local restaurants to support local business as well as open up our taste buds to things other than chain restaurants. Having family in Mt. Washington, I pass it occasionally so it's always been a place I've wanted to try. This was our first stop...The food was excellent and a great start to more of a finer dining experience. It's fancy, but not suit-and-tie fancy, so if you want to come in a nice pair of jeans and a dress shirt - you're good. The food was great! We ordered the Pasta Carmela and it was enough to take home. The garlic sauce was light yet satisfying and had a zing of spice which perfected the meal. We also were served garlic bread and a salad with a wonderful house dressing that reminded me of an Italian/Balsamic mix. Also note that the place is BYOB. Enough said... The place itself sort of crammed which was one of the only downfalls, but overall the experience was pleasant. Service is great, too. I definitely would like to come back and allow others to experience this gem.I was told this place had the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  I'm on a perpetual quest for the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  It's a noble pursuit.  Right now I believe the best Italian food is at Centro Anni Alla Famiglia.I walked into this place and thought, "people who said this was going to be amazing are damn liars!"  It was not good.  The food was like Del's, and this is not an endorsement.  If you enjoy paying a lot of money for mediocre Italian food you'll be able to tell was once frozen and likely freezer burned, this is the place for you.Maybe they were having an off day.  I hope so, because I really love good Italian food.  I was just very underwhelmed.Sorry, Olive Garden, I think when you said, 'when you're here, you're family,' you actually *meant* to say, 'when you're at La Tavola Italiana, you're family,' because seriously, that's what having dinner here is like.I want to ask, 'why haven't I been here before??' but the answer's pretty simple. This is not what you think of when you think of 'Mt. Washington Restaurants.' It's a low-key sort of place that's on a back street and you'd almost miss it if you weren't looking for it. But inside, it's like you walked into a big family dinner, and all your favorite relatives are there.When we arrived for our 8:30pm reservations, the dining room was PACKED. There were several giant parties (one of whom turned out to be host to a surprise engagement!), but we were seated right away, and from the moment our server Chris approached our table, I knew we were in for a treat.While Chris was opening our wines (oh yes, lest I forget to mention, IT'S BYOB!!) we chatted with him about our mutual love for the Food Network. This all began to make sense as soon as he described the night's specials to us. It is a wonderful thing to have a server who is passionate about the food he will be bringing you, and that's exactly what we had with Chris. He described every dish to us in detail as if he was a chef on Chopped and he had just prepared it for the judges.The decision was tough, but eventually my two dining companions and I settled on our meals. We started with an order of the antipasti - flavorful and fresh, but not so huge a portion that you spoil your appetite - and the fried zucchini. OH that fried zucchini! Crispy, savory, just lightly fried, and accompanied by a wonderful chunky marinara sauce. And at only $8.95, you can't go wrong. Promise me right now that when you come here, you will order the fried zucchini!We were having a celebratory dinner, so we were taking our time, and Chris really helped that happen. The pacing of the meal was just right: we had enough time to enjoy each course before the next arrived, and there was no pressure to choose our meals too quickly even though the restaurant was crowded.We enjoyed their crispy, buttery garlic toast alongside our house salads (excellent house Italian salad dressing!) as we waited for our entrees.Here was where the little snag came in: my girlfriends' meals came out first, and my chicken parm was nowhere in sight. Chris quickly explained that something had gotten mixed up in the kitchen and it would be just a short time. Since we were taking our time chatting and pacing out the meal, it wasn't a problem.But even though we were in no rush, Chris wasn't satisfied with our having to wait for my plate to come out separately from the others. He not only comped my meal as a courtesy, he treated all three of us to desserts on the house! I realize that mistakes happen in restaurants, especially on busy nights, and I always try to be understanding, but this extra step just meant so much to me. It really showed how important customer service is to this restaurant and its staff and how far they are willing to go to make a mistake right.Now. About that chicken parm....Let me just say that it was WELL worth the wait!! I am a little picky about red sauce, but this was off the charts. Hearty and savory and spiced just the right way. Whatever you didn't fit on your fork, you just HAD to dunk your garlic toast in. The breading on the chicken was light, the meat was cooked perfectly so that you barely needed to use a knife to cut the chicken. To be honest, I reeeeeally regretted my decision earlier in the night that I would take half home for my husband to have for dinner!From start to finish, our dinner at La Tavola Italiana was wonderful. Great service, excellent food, and an atmosphere that made you feel welcome as soon as you walked through the door. I am SO glad my friend insisted we have our celebration dinner here, because I might never have found this place. And now that I have, I know that I will be back for sure!

Review Text :
This Wendy's is an okay location.  It isn't the best or the worst, just average.  Let me tell you why, if you really want to know...1.  The food here is usually good.  The burgers are always great.  I heart the Baconator.  I mean it is burger, bacon, and cheese without anything to distract from meat and cheese heaven.  YUM.  I know it is probably the worst thing on the menu but I LOVE it anyways.  When the craving hits, off to Wendy's I go.  The other sandwiches are always good too.  And the chicken nuggets are always great snacks.Where this Wendy's gets a lower rating is due to the fries and the Frostys (or is it Frosties????).  Both are always a crapshoot.  Sometimes the fries are fresh, hot and amazing and some times they taste so blah.  The Frostys are usually good, but every now and then they taste like they forgot to add sugar or something.  If these 2 items could be more consistent, my score would go up for sure.2.  The staff.  Sometimes you get the best people helping you, which is always so very nice.  And then there are the other ones.  One lady who works here, usually the drive thru is simply UGH.  She barks at you to order, doesn't give you a minute to look if you ask for one, and practically throws your food at you when you get up to the window.  You are almost afraid to ask for some ketchup from her.  Overall, I think 75% of the staff is really friendly, but if you go on the wrong day and get the other 25%, then I am sorry for you.So most of the time, this location is good.  My advice to you is to always check your fries and Frostys before you leave to make sure you got good ones!This Wendy's used to be so good.  Wendy's in general used to be good.  Dave is probably rolling in his grave right now.  Wendy is nothing more than a pimped out fast food prostitute, the life torn from her, all over the dollar.Not only is the food not good anymore at pretty much any Wendy's, but the quality of service is severely lacking at this one and most in general.  Like most fast food places to me now (which I rarely eat at because of the decline in quality) it's better to go within the few hours of opening.  The foods fresh(er) and the staff doesn't hate the world just yet.  This location isn't even worth visiting just because it's on the main drag.  They need to inject some quality control into the management, employees and food or Wendy's will be the new Rally's.

Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #43 - #365My mom's friend's best friend treated us for dinner here at Pinoy Pinay. This is just another typical Filipino restaurant you'd find in any other city. The first impression that comes to me about this restaurant is that, it's a total DIVE! That doesn't mean the food is horrible. I'd say more average but not excellent. Since it's in Downtown, the area is not a great place to walk alone. The interior is very outdated and felt kind of dirty. Let's be honest here, the food is not that great but the prices are excellent and saved us a ton from eating on the strip. The place kind of reminded me of an old Filipino restaurant I ate at in Glendale in the 90's. The food wasn't that bad, more so and so. I picked up a tray and ordered the two item combo, pork barbecue skewers and chopped pork. Food was a bit cold and tasted old, the flavor in the barbecue was there and so was the chopped pork but they give you lots of rice! Would I come back here again? Maybe...

Firstly- this blows Dennys and IHOP out of the water when it comes to 24 chains. It's homemade and there is some love put into it. I would give this place a solid 4 for the food on a usual night (see- it's not something I'd rate as a 4 for a daytime breakfast- it's just A-OK) , but today the service was a miss and my pigs in a blanket didn't really have pigs. We were sat right away and a guy came to give us water and our drinks (not a server)....then we sat forever, and forever. BF waved down a guy to ask if someone can take our order. We then see him go get another guy and overhear their conversation that basically concluded that if we didn't speak up we would have never gotten an order because the guy didn't know there was anyone in his section. Gee, drink guy or lady who sat us, maybe tell the server if he's on break or maybe if he wasn't on break and doing other tasks to check his section once in a while. With the many staff we saw hanging out in the kitchen talking and hanging out or walking by us you'd think people would notice people waiting. We got our drinks refilled alright after the server knew we were there. BF got a Chef's Special- 2 French toast, 2 eggs and 2 sausages. - pretty good and standard.Mom in law got 2 biscuits&gravy w/ sausage and egg. Light biscuits and the gravy was nice and chunky with sausage and mushroom bits. Pretty decent. I got Apple Chicken Sausage Pigs in a Blanket- good sausage and the pancakes were light, fluffy and moist. Big hangup though- sheisty on the sausages! I have standard sized pancakes and I open them and only a HALF of a sausage was in each pancake......so it only had  half the pancake covered and the other half a empty, lonely blanket. (see picture) C'mon, most of the breakfast plates have more sausages than that. I ordered the 4 pigs thinking like most places that offer that many make a smaller pancake or a oval pancake that can surround a sausage from end to end. Better off getting a breakfast special so you can get pancakes, sausages, AND egg AND hasbrowns and maybe even some bacon or ham for the same price and wrap it yourself. I just think for $8.50 I should at least get enough sausage for the pancakes. Disappointing.  I know I don't feel well and am high off medication, but even I noticed that the tab was more than it should be. (see picture) Just saying, check your bills.  It was tabbed at $39.38 when it should be $30.42. Most places give you a electronic bill stapled to the original written pad, but here its totaled on the pad by hand. Since it is just handwritten here by people there is a possibility of making mistakes. The 2 stars is fair for this night.   It seems the raving reviews about the service is during daytime so maybe I will try a regular shift service...I know graveyard sucks, but c'mon it's your job to care and we just want to eat, pay for food and tip handsomely if you take care of us (my standard  20% for good, basic service, more for great service which I think is fair and generous) and go on home.Yeah this is hands down one of the best restaurants to get a delicious, hearty and home cooked from scratch breakfast!Like big portions? Mmmmm me too! lolI had the denver omelette and hashed browns. Easily on the list of mine for last meal on earth. Pancakes mmmmmm yeah baby. I love breakfast anytime of the day. This is my spot when wanting to fulfill my breakfast needs. Portions are big and hearty! We all love that! lolI am only rating on breakfast as I have been here twice for that only. I am positive without ever trying anything else on their menu that it is all pretty damn amazing! I would be willing to bet my last ducket on that!I love Blueberry Hill, I want to give the Owner a big kissy and give them an award for having a kick ass restaurant for me to enjoy!I will be back soon...very soon!The best of the Blueberry Hill restaurants in town. Counter service is reminiscent of diners in NJ.I LOVE THIS PLACE! Open 24/7! Just like Zippy's! Lol!Geez, what does Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant remind me of? Well........it kinda reminds me of a Yum Yum Tree, Denny's, The Original Pancake House, Zippy's.......all rolled up into one!Apparently Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has been around since 1966, but they have been serving the Las Vegas area since 1987! They have 4 restaurants within Las Vegas area, and I chose to take my friends to the restaurant on Decatur Blvd., as it was just across the street from the U.S. Post Office (I had to mail some stuff out), and because it was not too far from the downtown Las Vegas hotels.As we walked into this restaurant, it was packed! Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away. Upon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the "Grubsteaker Breakfast" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!One of my friends also picked the "Grubsteaker Breakfast" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an "Arnold Palmer?" Basically it's pineapple juice & lemonade......My other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say "Sugar Overload?" Lol!What can I say about my meal?Love it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn't have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland!The hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!Service was Excellent! I forgot to get our server's name, but she was friendly, fast, & efficient!What away to top off my quick trip to Las Vegas..........after eating my hearty breakfast, lunch was not needed...........I would be more than happy to come back here again for breakfast! I just love this place!

Oh The Good Egg. Or as I call it the I'm OK and Your Just Kinda OK Egg. Mediocre. Meh. Harmless not harmful. Kitchy but not catchy. Basic breakfast fare that tries to go outside the box with egg white omelets, low carb tortillas and southwestern fare. It's been called the Gay Egg and on weekends The Way Gay Egg. I appreciate its niche in the Phoenix restaurant scene. I do. It beats Denny's and IHOP. But now has competition from Matt's, Palette and Over Easy. I"m partial to any Central Ave. business and am sure I'll find myself here again. Service is mixed. Most are pleasant. Some. Well, some of them need a nap. While others might benefit from a double shot of espresso. I hate sitting at the horseshoe shaped counter. I find myself staring at the weathered individuals across the way wondering, "Gee, do you really need that extra bacon?". And on the flip side, I catch a few eyeballs focused on me and they're probably thinking, "I can't believe that guy has Hello Kitty sunglasses! Fag!"8/06Breakfast special- turkey wrap with country potatoes.  Service was a little slow; If I wasn't in a hurry to leave and make it to work on time, the wait wouldn't have been so terrible.  However, once I placed my order in, I swear, it didn't take but two or three minutes for the wrap to arrive.  I didn't know how to react, really.  I was happy that it came out so fast, yet I wondered, am I really getting oven-roasted turkey here, or is it processed?  Oh well...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-phoenix-2?select=NhFXFu6lTVY2XNBIMDdIxQ#NhFXFu6lTVY2XNBIMDdIxQGood bacon, and loved the ranch dressing, though I'd ask them to go easy on the dressing next time.  Liked the country potatoes that were on the crispier side, which there weren't many of.FYI, double-stamps on the weekends are back for the summer!I've eaten here several times with friends. This location is often referred to as "The Gay Egg" in the Gay & Lesbian community. The place where gays go for brunch on the weekends. I love that it's close to the light rail, they have free wi-fi connection and Stevia sweeteners. Restaurants that offer those automatically gets an upgrade in rating from me.They have a lot of healthy options here and have a small section of reduced fat, carbs and cholesterol free items for those watching their girlish figure.Portions are decent, but then again I don't eat a lot which is good.If your main order is more than $4.95, you can take advantage of their side order special. You can add dollar pancakes, side of fruit, etc.  for only $1. Cheap!

Review Text :
Following a pleasant time with the cast of Pin Up and other Yelpers in the Level 107 Lounge after enjoying the show, and finding no food available there, Diane and I each had a sudden craving for a good dessert.  So we descended in the tower elevator to see what Roxy's on the casino level had available.  The dessert case in front featured various small cakes that appeared to be too large for just two people.  But, after perusing the menu, we saw that sundaes and other smaller possibilities were also available.  So, we presented ourselves for seating in one of the booths.Not long afterward, I saw that more substantial fare was also featured on the menu--besides half-pound burgers.  The hunger pangs became more incessant.  So, in addition to an Apple Cobbler ala mode to share, Diane ordered Popcorn Shrimp, and I a BLT with Fries.  Little did I know at the time that this would be the biggest BLT I had ever seen.  The massive sandwich was buoyed by lightly toasted Sourdough Bread that was smeared with a thin layer of mayonnaise as I had requested; contained crisp lettuce, fresh tomato slices, and very good just slightly crisp bacon.  It was accompanied by slightly malleable Skin-on Fries and a Kosher Dill Pickle spear.  All were very tasty.  Somehow, within I-1/2 hours I succeeded in polishing off the whole BLT, plus Diane's tender Onion Straws.Then came the baked Apple Cobbler with a very large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  Unfortunately, because the dessert had real Raspberry Sauce trails streaked all across the top, and Diane is allergic to berries, we had to send this dessert back.  But our server immediately offered to bake and bring forth a new one, which he rather quickly did--after making a diner at another table happy through receipt of a free Apple Cobbler covered with Raspberry Sauce.  So, service was very good, and all ended well with a delicious large, warm, and doughy homemade Apple Cobbler adorned only with Vanilla Ice Cream.4-1/2 stars overall on this particular big moon night!Oh Roxy...tsk effing tsk...This All American Diner is located in The Stratosphere off the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. This place is open 24/7 which makes it convenient at 3am when you've given the casino far too much dinero and start feeling a rumbly in your tumbly and immediately think "where can I go to give this place even more money?"The vibe here is a retro 50's style (more or less) and they have a giant screen playing some classic black and white flicks. They are also, allegedly, supposed to have a DJ and the servers are supposed to sing...I don't know if these events occur at certain times or on certain days, but when we visited we did not experience any of this (it was 11ish on a Thursday night).Now, the service was both good and bad. I say that because the servers on the one side of the restaurant seemed quick and extremely attentive. However, the side of the restaurant where my wife and I and many other poor unfortunate souls were sitting...not so much. This guy was slow. When it takes over five minutes to even be acknowledged and another ten just to receive water, that's when I have a problem. Normally, I would have walked out on a situation like this but I was tired, hungry, and already sitting so I really didn't want to try to find something else. I don't know what our server's issue was as I saw very little of him and saw the other servers zipping around their sections repeatedly.In fact, orders were left sitting for pick up at the kitchen window for far too long before our server grabbed them to be delivered. Thankfully our food was hot and did not sit long, but there was a burger that belonged to a guy sitting at a booth adjacently from us and my wife watched it sit at the window for about 10 minutes before it was delivered to the guy (we sat by the kitchen so it wasn't hard to notice). My wife tried to warn the guy that his food had been sitting a long time and commented that hopefully it was warm. The guy (who either could care less, was drunk, stoned, or a combination of the three) simply nodded his head. The food itself was about average although portions were a tad above average. The potatoes were slightly mushy but the bacon in my sandwich was good. My wife's meal was supposed to come w/ an English muffin which never came. When we DID see our server again, we informed him of the MIA muffin and he said he would grab it...which turned out to be a lie. My wife and I had a few more bites left of our meals and still no English muffin. This was the last straw... We were able to flag down a manager and complain about our experience so far and he told us he would return. He did. He came back a few minutes and nonchalantly informed us our meal was taken care of and we were good to go. My wife looked at me and said "I guess I don't get that English muffin..." "Guess not" I replied, "but we do get to make like a tree and get the hell outta here."So, based on my experience here, it's a one star, but since our meal was comped I am giving Roxy's two stars and that is the only reason as to why.

Restaurant name  Cathay House Restaurant

Review Text :
The mission is on...to find a decent dim sum restaurant in Vegas and Cathay House was first on my list.  Originating from San Francisco, finding a stellar dim sum restaurant in the desert will definitely be a challenge!  But I'm on it!Cathay House was voted best dim sum in the local papers and received other accolades as noted on its wall.  I had high expectations!  It was bustling on a Sunday afternoon and there was a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2.  Once seated in the main dining room, ice water, tea, and forks arrived immediately.  (Forks?)  Okay, so there were chopsticks already on the table but I guess out here, they are used to people asking for forks.  There wasn't a huge variety of dim sum dishes to choose from, so that was already disappointing.  I did try the chicken feet in black bean sauce.  This dish lacked the full flavor that I'm used to.  The standard shrimp dumpling (har gow) and pork dumpling (shumai) were basic, if anything.  The salt and pepper shrimp had been sitting out too long after being stir-fried, not a good choice.  The beef rice noodle with a light soy sauce should be cut up to share a bit easier.  The crab claw puffs were average.I was anxious for the Shanghai dumplings, which they did not have.  Or the Shark Fin dumpling in soup with red vinegar and ginger slices to dip into.  Two of my favorites, and they were not available.  (And trust me, I did ask more than one employee for it.)Looking around for dessert, there were no egg custard tarts available or black sesame rolls.  I did see the sweet tofu, but that was about it.     There were a lot of dishes that weren't being ordered, in other words...they looked stale as they passed our table numerous of times.  When you see the same cart pass you when you first sit down, and realize that the same dishes are still not moving on it an hour later, the turnover of food is not happening here.I also think it's odd that they serve dim sum until 10 pm.  In my opinion, a true tea house restaurant should only serve dim sum during brunch hours.  That is the whole point of "drinking tea' aka yum cha or going for dim sum.  Overall, I don't plan on returning here unless I haven't found a better place yet.  My dining companion says this place WAS worthy of a three star in the past, but he had to change his review to a two now.  Sad sad.Late nate Chinatown Vegas eats!Cathay House has pretty good hours for those looking to eat a late dinner. They're open up to 5am (almost 24 hours- they open at 10am and close at 5am.)I came here for a late dinner and there were several folks who were also late night dining. This place seems to be known for their dim sum and at night time, they do offer some of their dim sum. We got a couple orders of their pork and shrimp siu mai. Aside from this, we ordered the wonton soup, pork chops, tofu with veggies and the chicken fried rice.The wonton soup was a nice starter. It had tasty broth and soft dumplings filled with pork. Next up for us was the pork and shrimp siu mai. It's no wonder their dim sum here is popular, because the pork and shrimp siu mai was delcious!  Our main courses of pork chops and tofu with veggies did not disappoint either. The pork chops were nice and crispy. They were also pretty lean. The tofu with veggies had a good mixture of greens and slices of tofu. All the dishes went well with the chicken fried rice. Portion wise was decent though the pork chop seemed fewer than what I've seen before. The rice was plentiful but not too much chicken. It was decent though and there was food for to-go!Not only was the food good, the price here was decent too with the bill just around $44[Review for DIMSUM only]I'm sure you've needed to buy a car - a brand-spanking-new one OR a semi-whored-out-used version - at one point in your life and have experienced a nagging-dying-to-complete-a-sale-to-take-out-a-chick-salesperson. It wasn't the greatest of experiences right?Well, meet the DIMSUM version.I really wonder if these ladies work here on a full commission basis OR have been set STRICT ASIAN QUOTAS (those having worked overseas OR know someone who does may have learnt at some point how some retail outlets staff actually have DAILY quotas to meet...OR else ADIOS bish). They sure fly around in their dimsum carts like the establishment is a go-cart-track...and pushing for sales a LOT more aggressively than I would say a carsalesperson would at the end of the month.Best part? The moment they knew I spoke Chinese...they went gung-ho-YOU-need-MORE-meat-on-you-SON-"YOUTOOSKINNNNNNNNNNNNNY" on me. (Bish, please...you look anoxeric! Maybe?) Well, they still WON...since I tend to be a pushover with asian-aunties-battling-menopause and their dimsum carts...and found my small table for 2 with food for at least 5 gargantuan eaters.Yet, this place, which was recommended by locals (asian ladies that you'd find working at the hotels and casinos that I randomly started conversations with to ask for tips on LOCAL food joints), isn't that great. (I think I got trolled.)Oilier dimsum...below average quality (just seems like the food sat out a little too long as well as tasting rather bland...)...and ISN'T PIPING HOT...mehBut what really killed it for me was this ever present sour taste that wasn't vinegar...and if you know your dimsum (OR even any other food in general)...this ISN'T A GOOD SIGN. Maybe, the health department might have to come over for an (S)INspection...before, as comedian Russel Peters imitates his dad, "Somebody Gonna Get a Hurt Real Bad".If you're craving dimsum, I'd say...just wait until you get out of Vegas and hit a real spot instead. And if you HAVE to be here, please don't order the dimsum BUT order ala carte dishes instead - at least if the food isn't that fresh, the raging fire under the wok will fudgingly kill everything in it.It may just save you a trip to the porcelain throne of shame. (Don't ask).This was only the second time I have been to Cathay House. I came for dim sum years ago and didn't have much of a desire to return but I couldn't resist giving them another chance recently.We arrived around noon and they weren't too busy. I felt rushed to order, even though we kept telling them we wanted to wait for our entire party to be seated. We ordered hot tea and waters all around and then proceeded to order from the carts that came around. They pushed the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good value at $15.99, it had to be reheated before they served it to us. The lobster was chewy and the noodles felt like total filler, didn't have much flavor and were overcooked. The highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls. The ribs had to be reheated for us before serving which was a turn off.The rest of the items we ordered weren't very memorable and I wouldn't recommend most, if any, of it. The coconut bun, egg custard, bbq pork buns and smelt were all completely forgettable.Service was ok, although refills were a little hard to come by for our waters and tea. There are other dim sum places in town I prefer with fresher items, so I don't see myself coming back any time soon.

4.5 starsFINALLY!!!!   I've found real Mexican food in Las Vegas!  I've been searching for over 4 years.  It's been an emotional roller coaster of getting my hopes up only to be disappointed time and time again.  Growing up in Southern California I guess I have high standards.  But no more let downs, my search is ended.This place is no joke.  It's as good if not better than many of the taco trucks I've eaten at in L.A.They serve the best, most perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned tripas.  The buche was awesome - tender and juicy.  Carnitas - not tex mex crap - this is the real deal.  Like southern pulled pork.Cabeza was great, the carne asada solid, the al pastor was up there.I've had better tortillas but I'm not complaining - these worked.The food was so delicioso it actually brought a little tear to my eye.  And talk about cheap eats.  Tacos are like a buck each.  Be sure not to order more than 2 or 3 tacos per person at a time - they're best served hot off the grill.  You can always go back to the counter and order again, and again, and again....And be sure to throw a five spot in their tip jar, they deserve it.(photos submitted)

Redbeard's made my bad night even worse.I know when I sit down at a bar  I don't scream dollar signs but yet and still I expect to be treated with some kind of decadency since I am a paying customer.  This was a truly crummy experience. Going to the bar alone is risky case in point with this review, I am use to being over looked but not treated rudely. I ordered a Carona and when I asked for a lime the bartender let out an audible sigh and then shoved a lime wedge at me on a napkin.  I know my way around a bottle of beer and Carona's are served with a lime wedge stuffed into the bottle...but for whatever reason it was too much of a hassle. Also on my visit the bartender introduced himself and asked the names of the ladies who sat down next to me, even though they came in a full 20 minutes after I already been sitting there. He never once gave me his name or asked for mine that hurt my feelings.I want to add that I ordered 3 tacos and all of my taco shells were burned and the tacos had no salsa or sauce of any kind.  I have burned many a taco shell and I know it would have only taken the cook a measly 30 seconds to reheat more shells but they served them to me in burned shells anyway.  I have plenty of disposable income and I don't mind sharing it, but tonight I had to tip my bartender 2 centers and trust me it hurt me more than it hurt him.

Restaurant name  Thai Taste
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This is the best Thai food in Charlotte.  I repeat.  This is the BEST Thai food in Charlotte. Another one of the "secret" restaurants that you need to be told about it's located in the Dilworth area right next to the popular gift store Paper Skyscraper.  The original and best of several locations (Matthews, University) I went there religiously the entire time I lived in CLT.  As diverse as their menu was, I only sampled three dishes there Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao and "House Noodles".  The last one being a specialty that's no longer listed on the menu.  The rating system is 1 to 6 stars and you can even order it with no stars for the scared or gastro-intestinally challenged.  For the true "chili head" you can augment the rating system.  Normally, they use crushed Thai peppers in the food which are still hot but don't capture the true essence of the "heat" and flavor.  When you're ready for the big leagues make sure to denote "fresh peppers" when giving them your stars.  The flavor difference is immediately noticeable from the very first bite.For lunch during the week you need to get there by 11:30am or after 1:00pm unless you want to stand in line for a long time.  The place is popular and regularly packed.  They get all the businesses in the area, the residents of the trendy Dilworth neighborhood and a boatload of cops.  For many (like myself) this place is an addiction and you will see many regulars.I can't say enough good things about this place.  When I spent most of '07 overseas this was one of the first places I hit upon returning to the States.  Even now, all other Thai places I encounter are measured against Thai Taste.  If you spend any time in the Charlotte area you simply MUST try this restaurant out, you will not be disappointed.*side note* For the truly adventurous you can go past the 6 star rating, but be prepared for "heat" especially when going the "fresh peppers" route.  Also be aware that anything over 10 stars is a personal challenge to the chef and he will guarantee you feel more heat/pain than you ever have in your life.  Enjoy responsibly.This is the only time I have ever felt deceived by a high star number on Yelp.  My husband and I were walking around Southend pub hopping, and when it was time for dinner we pulled out the 'ol Yelp app and found this place right around the corner and with a solid four star rating.  We LOVE thai food, and we know that it is always a good option for vegetarians in unknown restaurant areas.  Unfortunately we were completely underwhelmed.The restaurant itself is really cute - lots of wood paneling, Thai themed decor and paintings, wood tables and chairs.  The staff was also very friendly.  That's about where anything resembling four starts ends for me.  I ordered the Pad Thai as I have found this to be steadily good in the twenty or so other Thai restaurants I have eaten at around the country.  Here, it tasted like it was mixed up with a weird sweet and sour sauce.  Pad Thai should not be sweet.  At all.  They also did not give us the option for hotness levels, which I didn't think of until after we ordered, so our food came out very mild.  My husband ordered the Pad Woon Sen, which while better than my Pad Thai, was still unimpressive.  I left disappointed with a sticky sweet taste in my mouth.If this had come up on the app as a three star restaurant, our experience would have been much more explainable.  Hopefully the food is better other times, though what was coming out to other tables looked much like what we were served so I don't know.  I would give the ambiance, location and service a four, but the food a one or two.  I can't give this place a three star review, because I really don't feel that it's "A-ok".  So we'll go with the two star "Meh, I've experienced better", because that's exactly how I feel.I've been wanting to try this place for a year and a half and with my impending due date in sight I was determined to get some spicy food! We ordered the veggie spring rolls to start and while I wasn't a huge fan, the chili sauce they are served with is spectacular! I got the chicken pad see ew and omg! Best dish I've ever had!!!! I ordered it the first time at a "2" heat level and the second time- just a few days later at a "3"...; super amazing! If you are in the area and want to get some great food, stop by Thai Taste!!!! You will not be disappointed!

I had booked on OpenTable and when I arrived on time, we were immediately seated to a table even though there were others waiting near the hostess stand. Awesome.Looking over the menu, I had made my decision from the rather expensive listing of steaks and side dishes. That changed when our waiter - Matt, who was awesome - went over the evening's specials. Suddenly, the idea of a trio of small filet mignons was what I wanted and each with a different topping/sauce. Massive wine list but only a small list of beers and an even smaller list of local beers. In fact, just one. OMB Copper. All three of us started with the wedge salads. These were good portions with plenty of blue cheese to go with the lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Not a bad deal for $4!When they arrived, the steaks looked perfect. Three small filets, each in a different sauce. The first two, a bearnaise and an Oscar, I enjoyed thoroughly. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of sauce on top. But by the time I had cut into the third one, it was no longer quite so perfect. More overdone than I ordered and a bit of a tougher cut, especially since the first two were so good. Bummer.For dessert, I let Matt talk me into the bread pudding. It was... fair. Just not that great with not enough taste and some of the topping was over done. I wouldn't have this again.On the pros list, no wait for a seat when we had a reservation, excellent service from Matt, a local beer choice, great salad, and great steaks.On the cons list, the booth was a bit too tight for the three of us to sit comfortably. Perhaps another inch or two, please? Only one choice for a local beer. Most of the steaks were great and the dessert was only fair.Complimentary valet parking is nice, as there is not much street parking nearby.Sullivan's is a higher-end steak joint and works hard to earn that high dollar menu.

Review Text :
So this is a family restaurant that has been in Las Vegas since 1969 and has some food options that can't be found anywhere else in Las Vegas. The nameless, homemade noodle soup with cheese is out of this world. The salsa is homemade and they have two options, one that is hot and one that is more of a chunky salsa, the chips are also homemade and delicious. They also offer lots of different options, with mix and match dinner entrees as well.Bottom line, you will never satisfy everyone on any aspect but I support family run and small businesses not to mention Las Vegas locals.The margaritas also are hand poured and are divine. So try it, trust me, you will like it!My friend and I were on the hunt for some fried ice cream, the majority of the restaurants near us either closed early or were closed Sunday's. So we had the choice of eating here or at Coasta Cantina at the Suncoast. Walking in, there was no hostess, she was in the back and emerged to bring another customer her order, when she did acknowledge us, she was very friendly and proceeded to seat us, handed us the menus, and took our drink orders. Their website states they offer happy hour from 8 p.m. to close on Sunday's, but I can't confirm since there was no mention of it to us.I took a look at the menu because I was craving ceviche but they did not have any, which was a bit of a let down because all of the Mexican restaurants I've visited have it. We just ended up ordering the dessert we originally came for, fried ice cream and also ordered some sopapillos. After we placed our order, the dessert came out around 5 minutes later. We took a look at our fried ice cream and were a bit thrown off. It looked pre-made, it was cold on the outside, no whipped cream, no cherry on top, and the texture was weird, it looked glazed, and came in a cinnamon shell. It was like no fried ice cream we've ever had, it's normally fried before it's brought out, so it's warm on the outside, cold on the inside, not here. Now for the sopapillos, they were not thick or fluffy enough, they did have good flavor since they were coated with cinnamon and sugar but it's a dessert that is very hard to screw up. After we received our order, no one came to check up on us, it took a little while to receive our checks so basic customer service was definitely lacking and there were only two other tables when we walked in. I was really disappointed. Overall we decided on this place because it was smaller and we thought, why not give our business to a mom and pop restaurant instead of a corporate company, but it was a mistake.

This is a god-awful excuse for a restaurant.  The actual serving of food is last on its list of priorities, which run something like this:1) Having heavily-made-up waitresses treat diners rudely.2) Functioning as a place for bald-headed men to drink.3) Using "valet parking" to totally tie up the intersection of 17th and Carson.4) Being a mediocre-to-poor Americanized "Japanese" restaurant.I had sushi the only time I came here (probably about three years ago).  It was really bad.  Cold, rubbery rice that not only didn't have any rice vinegar in it, but wasn't properly cooked.  Rolls looked like they had been created in a fit of pique by a drunken marmot or other mammal lacking opposable thumbs.  And the fish, while not being actively spoiled, was not notable for its freshness either.If you want hibachi, try Yokoso.  If you want excellent, authentic sushi, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill.  If you want pretty decent, cheap sushi, try Oishii Bento in Oakland.  But for the love of god, don't come here for any reason.Let me start with what works at Nakama: The servers. They're super nice and efficient.What doesn't work is the food, the prices, the crowds, the incredibly busy, loud bar without the possibility of being seated in the quieter room (reserved only for Habachi eaters) -- even when you're paying $15.00/person FOR LUNCH!  And, the restaurant demands that you dress in nice casual wear. No t-shirts, yet the food was terrible!We shared the Spider Roll and the Chicken and Shrimp Habachi plate, as well as a seaweed salad. The salad was okay. The Spider Roll came in a sticky, overly-sweet sauce which ruined the flavor. The crab was rubbery and seemed old. The chicken Habachi was waaaaaaay overcooked (dry to the point of being hard to swallow),  the shrimp smelled old , and it was NOT DEVEINED (read: it still had the poop tunnel in it!). ICK! This is supposed to be Pittsburgh's finest sushi restaurant? Old fish meets overcooked chicken, meets truly bad sushi, meets loud bar with no option to sit elsewhere (even when you're not drinking), meets overpriced lunch menu!My advice: Go elsewhere! If you want something to eat, check out ANY other restaurant in the South Side. Even if it's bad, it won't be as expensive as Nakama. But, there are better places to be had in Pittsburgh. Not being from the area, I can't speak for sushi bars, but,  I especially like The Gypsy Cafe and Primanti's in the South Side. Cheers!

I had a really bad experience here. I had been dying to try the apple pancake that I had heard many good things about, so I headed to the Original Pancake House. The service was terrible. The server practically forgot my table existed. I had to wait a long time for anyone to even approach the table. When she finally did, I ordered a coffee and the apple pancake. My coffee came out and EW, there was lipstick on the cup. Unfortunately I didn't notice until the waitress had already wandered away from the table and when I was finally able to get her attention again, it took her far too long to return with a fresh cup. When my pancake arrived, it was enormous. I looked down to get my fork in preparation of my first bite of apple-y goodness and was appalled to find my fork was dirty. I again had to try to get my waitress' attention to replace my fork, which again took forever.  Finally, I'm ready to eat. The flavor was nothing spectacular and I became bored about three bites in. I really don't have too many positive things to say about this place and can't say I'm particularly motivated to try it again after this negative breakfast experience.This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. I had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). Service is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. My family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same. I mean there wasn't even a piece of orange or parsley or melon on my plate like there usually is when you order breakfast at any other breakfast placeOur waitress was a superstar,  older woman and so friendly and attentive to our needs even anticipated our needs having our grand daughter there.  OPH was my first job in mid 70's actually inspiring me to become a chef and restaurateur.  My main job was preparing the famous corned beef hash in the Hawaii locations. Since then,  I've always made OHP my home and boasted on their food and quality especially since I've lived in Portland,  OR where the original location and family resides boasting the famous passed down starter cultures that make up my beloved Dutch Baby. So one thing I know and know well is OPH food especially the corned beef that I've made all my life. 2 stars are for my waitress and her service which if yelp broke the ratings in categories I'd give her 5 stars and hire her any day in any if my restaurants. Now to the food.  It just sucked period! The Dutch baby was so flat and pancakes were soured only meaning they don't follow protocols for the starters and batter was old and not kept refrigerated causing it to sour. My so called corned beef was a blatant ripoff, they tried to pass off their older ham chopped up and with onions all fluffy and they couldn't make hash with ham because it comes out like fluffy hamburger.  Even waitress said others complained the same thing.  Don't take my word for it, see for yourself,  all I ask is you know what corned beef is and eaten at other locations besides vegas. They are cutting corners to save on food costs and waste. Shame on you!!!!!My concerns and disappointment was addressed with the manager or owner,  the older gentleman but he denied my findings as a professional chef and was extremely rude even though I was being courteous.  This leads me to believe that the cooks run the place without challenge or proper management.  I will forward my findings to Portland along with the pictures of the fake corned beef.  I did pay for everything and never asked for a discount or any refunds.  It's just a crime what they're doing to such a wonderful franchise and food concept. Change management and food and maybe we won't lose our last OPH in Vegas.Q: Where can you find...church goers, hungover peeps, masses of kids and some of the quickest, delicious breakfast in all of Charlotte? A: Original Pancake HouseYup, it's a smorgasbord of hungry folks and it's tasty. And yes, it's a chain, but I can't help but express my love for this particular OPH. If you're looking for breakfast, early in the mornin' or late in the afternoon, I highly recommend dropping by here. If you make this particular breakfast run on a Sunday, be prepared to run into a line of hungry folks. But it's ok, really - don't you fear. A very long line absolutely flies into the restaurant in lighting quick speed. I don't know how many cooks OPH has working, but those guys/gals are really, really fast. Thus the tables turn really, really quickly. No joke, as soon as hubs and I are seated we are out of there in 30-40 minutes at the longest. I usually order the French Crepes - perfectly cooked, delicious, thin crepes stuffed with fresh strawberries accompanied by a side of strawberry sauce. I typically order only two as the regular order comes with three and I just can't handle that much delectable goodness. Make sure you try the turkey sausage too - it's pretty amazing. If you're more of an omelet fan, OPH makes them the size of footballs. They.are.huge. Oh, and they come with a side of pancakes, so be sure to come hungry. This particular joint is a staple for me as I'm always craving those damn crepes. Thanks, OPH!Everything I ate here today tasted like it was concocted in back from bags of dried egg, pancake mix, and the scariest of all - hollandaise powder. Fatty texture but not even a little butter or lemon flavor in that mother of all breakfast indulgences. Burnt, dry, microwave tasting omelettes, puffed and brown. Freezer-flavored hash browns with no crisp to them whatsoever. Basically, the best argument towards anti-corpo food that I've eaten in a long, long while. It hurt pretty bad, as I used to frequent this chain constantly as a kid - the Kosher made my gma+gpa happy, dad went for the apple pancake, week in, week out. Smoked salmon, potato pancakes, it was all delish. And strawberry pancakes, with fresh whipped cream, were totally my jam.This new thing sporting the same name is like the OPH I remember but nightmarishly riffing off the nastiest of Denny's. Potato pancakes thin like paper, eerily tasting of potato, floppy and gummy. Sour cream in tiny, spit-cup sized containers. Watered down applesauce. No thanks.

I love their carne asada burrito con todos! The con todos makes it super creamy. The flavor is just amazing. I've been a big fan of their food since early 2000s. One of my coworkers introduced me to this place one day when I asked him where I can get a delicious burrito. The size of the burrito seems to have gotten smaller. I used to have trouble finishing it. But still, I think they are one of the best in town. I recommend using a generous amount of their green (verde) sauce.  I could probably use half a bottle on my burrito. So if they run out, you can blame me. I also like their shrimp & fish ceviche tostadas. There are other locations in town but I feel like this original location is the best.What we call $4 tacos at 74th street Baptist church, we call a sinny-sin-sin... $3 is the most I would ever pay for a taco.... so how did I end up paying $4 each for 3 here? Oh, the toppings are extra. Yep, extra on top of an already overpriced 'co. Lord knows how they figure out what's what. $.15 here, $.35 there, $.07 around the corner, $.27 for a bag... This whole experience was a mess. I tried to get all three tacos without sour cream and 2/3 ended up with it, my veggie taco ended up being carnitas (and $4), it took 12 min at the window to get my food, the wrong salsa was in the bag, oh, and the tacos were $4 each. Three tacos shouldn't cost more than 2 burritos. The three stars is bc naturally they were delicious. -2 for the price and wack job service (even for a drive through). Next time, I'm headed to Tacos El Gordo.Went to lunch on a Friday afternoon here. Since I have been to Tacos El Gordo so many times I wanted to give these guys another try since the first time was the Taco Trek UYE months ago (Thanks Nelson Q!).I was pretty hungry so I was thinking the standard Carne Asada Burrito would fill me up based on the tacos I got last time. If you  refer to my pic, the burrito was not all that big. In fact, if you don't tell them you want it with everything (which is cheese, guacamole, and sour cream for an extra 1.50), all that's in there is just the meat and beans. So for 5.75 you get a tiny burrito. Add the 1.50 just so you can a little more stuffing in it. I paid a total of 7.84 with tax. Now I don't know about you guys, but lots of other places would give you a huge burrito for that price. So yes, I was a bit disappointed.While I was eating, I noticed a majority of the patrons were Caucasian. Weird. If you go to Tacos El Gordo, its mainly Mexicans. So what am I missing? Are you telling me that Los Tacos is more of an Americanized establishment? Don't get me wrong. To me there's nothing wrong with that. It just didn't look right. Some other things I noticed: They don't have a salsa bar. They do have salsa verde in squeeze bottles on just about every table. I guess you have to ask them for other sauces on the side if you don't like the green sauce which I thought is pretty good.Next couple of visits I will try the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada because I saw somebody order it and scarf it down. I was so tempted to interrupt their first bite just so I can ask to take a picture of it. LOL.

I don't know WHO thinks this is real BBQ. They must have either 1) never eaten real BBQ or 2) never had food with flavor before.This CRAP is disgusting, bad location, no flavor. Brisket sandwich had NO flavor or bbq sauce and all fatty meat. The TriTip was just a few slices of fatty meat with no flavor.The hus puppies were OK, kinda burnt. For $25 bucks I'd rather eat anywhere else. What a waste of time and money.

This Pizza Hut is great. For chain pizza this location seems to make it like was back in the day. When I order pan pizza it is thick and cooked all the way through. They always have deals as most pizza places do. When they have the deals for any pizza, any size, any crust, I wish they would honor that and not charge extra for stuffed crust. Any crust means ANY CRUST. Okay... I got that out. The wings are bomb-diggity! if you don't know about Wing Wednesday then you should check it out. Wings are 50 cents each. I get an order of 8 buffalo burnin' hot (boneless) for $4 and it comes with a side of dressing. There is a good selection of flavors.Sometimes I order for delivery but usually just pick it up since it is close to my home and quicker. I always order online and never have any problems.

Oh sweet Jesus in the manger. Really the first thing I thought of when I woke up today was I would love some papusas. Now this makes for a great restaurant.We ordered a big breakfast of fried eggs over easy, plantains, beans and crema and papusas. The papusas are like pancakes - you can ordered them stuffed with beans and cheese or pork! Talk about $1.50, let me order 27. It's quite the bargain $12 check average and we pigged.I was eyeing every other customers food, they served a shrimp cocktail in a deep glass with salsa and avocados on the bottom, I saw the guy put hot sauce on his shrimp and I wanted to crawl over Julia S. and go sit with them. There is a reason this place is packed.I wonder what time they open?

Cheese crisp!!!  This place is *right* across the street and I've only been a few times.  Tonight, I needed something fast, close and naughty!  So, I remembered someone recommending the cheese crisp.The tortilla was super-crispy and LOADED...LOADED...LOADED with cheese!  I also got the green chile strips on it.  They were huge strips and cut the greasy cheese just right.  Side of awesome guac - had a little kick to it!  The place itself isn't fancy at ALL.  There are a few different rooms to dine in.  Service was really friendly - all young boys.  Woohoo!Los Compadres is an A-ok place to stop and have some A-ok Mexican food. You order via a friendly counter service and they give you a number. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. They were good! Nothing fancy or spectacular, just straightforward. I wished for a little more flavor in the chicken, but it wasn't horrible. I also ate Ayesha's leftovers the next day... solid. If you're looking for a spot that's a bit "hole in the wall" simple Mexican, then Los Compadres is the spot for you! I would gladly return and try their other entrees!Hang on...gotta wipe the cheese off my chin.  Oh, crap, the enchilada sauce is on my keyboard.Cheese crisp with Guacamole.  Two cheese enchiladas, one for tomorrow.There's a mess.  Everywhere.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhyessssssssssss!Why 5 stars?Freakin' awesome Mexican food, and CRAZY cheap prices!So, I went a bit overboard (as always) in ordering.I just wanted to try so many different thingsssssI got:Cheese crisp with green chile strips and guacamoleMini green chile chimichanga1 cheese enchiladaSide order of refried beansChips and salsaAll that food... .$15And it ended up being way too much food.  WAY too much.I loved everything...EVERYTHING I SAY!And that's truly a rarity.

You know, I have a knack of always managing to sit by the scary, crazy guy when I dine alone. I was really, really, really hoping that this would only be a CA thing and that other states would not bring me this problem.No. I really do have a talent of sitting by crazy people...nationwide. So, despite the fact that I was flanked by a drunk who was obsessed with both his fake knees and trying to sue corporate America, a photographer who kept trying to smoke me out, a professor who fancied fine scotch and corrected my grammar, and two girls singing Meatloaf....well...guess that tells you about the culture now, doesn't it?! Pretty fun place that's not overwrought with drunk college students becuase it's a little bit of a distance from campus.Milwaukee, a little over an hour from Madison, is a beer-drinker's city. I hate beer; but it is important to mention that a lot of beer comes from WI. Mind you, it's mostly Pabst, Schlitz, and stuff of that caliber. But there are also some fine WI staples and microbrews....Spotted Cow coming up the most....many of which are on tap here. That said, I was both surprised and impressed that Sierra Nevada was also on tap here. But, it's not a trip to Wisconsin without indulging in what they do best, fried cheese curds. If you've never had them, imagine fried mozzarella...but much better. They were pretty good here; but I wish they came with marinara sauce instead of (or in addition to) ranch.Bar staff is pretty cool.

I have been back several times since my initial review and have not been disappointed. Today, Norm and I braved out the south side of 19th ave and Peoria. Once again it was an excellent meal, especially for $5.35. I had the red chili burrito with rice and beans and shared chips and salsa with Norm. The burro was full of chunks of beef simmered in red sauce and covered with cheese and more red sauce. The rice was perfect and the bean... oh the beans... you cannot have better. The staff was on top of it and extra friendly.Who wouldn't love a restaurant with great prices, deep fuschia walls (yes!), friendly service, great food ... and lots of parking? (Hear that, Los Reyes de la Torta?)Upon reading Daren C's review, I decided to try this place for lunch and had the pleasure of having Daren join me too. I ordered the green chili burro lunch special. The burro was huge, had large chunks of tender beef, and was nicely seasoned. The rice that came with the meal was tasty, and the beans - wow, they're knock-your-socks-off good! We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good, and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil. Hmm, culinary secrets are sometimes hard to pry out of people. A great, generous meal for $5.35, tax included. So happy to have this gem in my neck o' the woods!

Restaurant name  Fiesta Filipina
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Having been to the Philippines working on U.S. Military projects, I was used to ethnic Filipino cuisines while I was there decades ago.I came to know that an old professional colleague of mine is now a Las Vegas resident and was quite surprised to received my unexpected call. With his directions, we eventually met at this Filipino restaurant for a quick lunch, for I intended to be driving back to LA afterwards that day.However, the quick lunch turned out into a seemingly endless feast of Filipino cuisines and delicacies, as we talked about old times, the best of times, as well as the worst ones in the Philippines and in various countries we've been while deployed overseas.I was glad I relented coming to Fiesta Filipina, instead of insisting for my friend to come over for buffet at the restaurant in my hotel.Incidentally, the word "Fiesta" in Filipino language means feast, and that was really a sumptuous feast we had.The next time I'll be in Vegas, I'll definitely come by this place near the southeast corner of Jones and Desert Inn.And indeed, just like aged fine wines, old time friends are certainly considered the best.Fiesta Filipina is one of my go to spots for Filipino food whenever I'm in Vegas. I like the location, selection of food and overall atmosphere of the place.Most Filipino restaurants in Vegas are on Maryland Parkway but this one is located on Jones Blvd. It's in at the corner of a small strip mall. I like this location because it's easy to find and get to. It's also not too crowded.The place is small and cute. Their decor is very Filipino with welcome and goodbye signs in Tagalog. They have kawayan bamboo wood decor around. Their back wall has a neat collage of Filipino celebrities who have frequented the restaurant. There are flat screen TVs on both ends of the restaurant where people can enjoy the latest sport game on cable or something on  the Filipino channel.This place is not a buffet, instead it is turo- turo (Tagalog for point point). There is a display of food ready to eat and you point to which dish you want. They have a vast selection of traditional Filipino foods like kare-kare (meat in peanut butter broth), caldereta (beef stew), Filipino bbq skewers (chicken and beef), beef steak (beef with onions), menudo (pork stew), sinagang ns isda (sour fish soup) and lumpia (Filipino egg rolls).  If you don't want anything from the ready made dishes,  they do have some items that you can order and they can prepare especially for you like crispy pata (fried pork). For drinks, they have Filipino cantaloupe juice and various sodas. They offer dessert too! They have halo halo (Filipino shaved ice) and turon (Filipino banana egg rolls). On my last visit here, I tried the kare-kare, the chicken skewers,  the beef steak and the turon. The kare kare broth on top of the white rice was a winner. I also liked the tender chicken skewers that surprisingly had a spicy kick to it. The beef steak had lots of shredded beef with onions. This one was good but a bit oily. The turon was a nice treat at the end. Crispy and sweet, the turon is a good deal for a $1. Like my previous visits, I left happy and full! I also had plenty of left over to take to-go.This is a good spot to go to for Filipino food in Vegas!If you're looking to get some authentic Filipino food, then Fiesta Filipina should be on your list of Pinoy places to try out.The decor was quaint, wooden, and very reminiscent of traditional Phillipine household decor. I really liked the vibe of this place; the staff was all friendly and ordering went smoothly. It's a turo-turo place (tagalog translation: to point), so you basically point to the dish you want to order and then you pay at the end of the line. It's an easy way to try a lot of different foods in one place, to be honest. Don't expect super fancy dining either, what you see is what you get -- traditional Filipino dishes. I had the two item combo plate which comes with steamed rice and two choices of entrees. I picked the sinigang na bangus (milkfish in a soup that has a tamarind base) and the classic Filipino beefsteak. What a good deal because it was under $10!The portioning for the sinigang na bangus was one fish steak with some soup, but they could've thrown in some veggies other than ginger. It had the superb sour taste, which means they put the right amount of sampalok (tamarind) in the soup.The beefsteak was PERFECT! It had the strong kalamansi taste (more citrusy) which went well with the tenderness of the beef and sweetness of the white onion. It really was marinated to the right taste... It's making my mouth water just thinking about it! It's THE perfect pairing to your steamed rice. The steamed rice, however, was a little more on the wet side, which isn't ideal but still good to eat.This is a good showcase of Filipino heritage. The kind of food they have out is the kind of food you actually have to (and want to!) try within the Filipino food realm. Oh, and they have good BBQ skewers! Ang sarap!

I haven't eaten much Jamaican food. But jerk chicken, oxtail and fried plantains come to my mind right away along with colorful tropical drinks. When I first saw Jamerica's menu I was surprised to see curry and BBQ on it. After some looking into the cuisine. Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavors, spices and influences from the native people on the island of Jamaica, and the Spanish, British Africans, Indian and Chinese who have inhabited the island.    Mango Rundown was cabbage and carrots stewed in coconut milk with  yellow curry on a bed of beans and rice. The rice perfectly soaked up the sweet sauce. The jerk chicken and BBQ(not sweet kind) chicken were fall off the bone tender, A chill night out with Bob Marley of course playing in the background.

Review Text :
It's a good 10 miles or so from the Vegas Strip.  But this location of this chain crab and seafood restaurant is so totally Las Vegas.  It screams "tourists, come inside!". You've got the tacky weathered all wood pseudo shack with "Joes Crabshack" sign outside.  Inside, there are Christmas lights all year, the big goofy 12' long fake fish hanging from the ceiling, men's bathroom with "Dudes" on it, and a special on 60 oz. pitchers of beer. And as a special treat, the kids had the best balloon guy ever.  For one kid, he did a Darth Vader all black "hat" with a black sword.  For a little girl, he created an orange fish with blue bubbles.  And for her sister, created a six petaled flower with green steams.  We were seated in about 5 minutes at 7 PM on a Friday night.  I really had low expectations of this place since I didn't enjoy my surf and turf meal at their Denver Colorado location a few years back.  Although I love crab, I hate to get my hands and shirt all dirty at a restaurant.  I will get sloppy at home where I can take a shower immediately after, but not here.  Pots of crab and seafood were the most popular item here.  A lot of the items are fried, like fish and chips, fried crawfish, fried shrimp. My brother had the lump crab cake dinner with two crab cakes, a small bowl of coleslaw, and french fries ($13).   The two crab cakes were moist and naturally sweet with the true subtle crab flavor coming through, with just a slight douse of onion and garlic.  The fries were tender and crisp, and not too greasy.  The cole slaw had bits of red and green cabbage, and carrots in a slighlty tangy and very sweet mayo dressing. I would give that meal a 4.5 rating.  I had the half and half crawfish combo ($12) with one half crawfish etouffee with bits of crawfish in a warm creamy sauce.  The other half was deep fried crawfish tails. It was served with rice and cocktail sauce. Both are actually good and not overcooked.  I only at 1/3 of it because of my New Year's resolution to reduce my intake of fried foods. Myh meal was perhaps 3.5 stars. Our meals were enhanced by the beers on tap. My brother had Sam Adams regular lager, I had the Blue Moon.Service was attentive enough. Music playing in the background was classic rock and pop from the 70s to the 90s.  The place is loud and energetic, with little kids and adults loving the tacky atmosphere, comedic balloon guy, and the food.  It was a pretty good experience here. .We dined here a couple times so far this year.  The Station Square location is okay.  We really wanted to eat outside, but the picnic tables looked pretty dilapidated.  So, we opted for a booth inside.  This place is so kitzy.  Even the tables are a designer's worst nightmare.  They have beach junk everywhere.Both times, our service was fairly attentive.  On our recent visit, I went crazy and got a Crab Daddy feast.  Three kinds of crab legs:  Snow crab, Dungeness crab and and King crab!  I honestly don't know which was which.  My bf even had to train me in the use of the crab cracker and the claw.  Love, love, loved playing with my food.  Nothing more fun than eating with your hands.  What a mess!!  It came with my choice of seasoning, I picked Chesapeake Style which is basically Old Bay Seasoning even on new potatoes and corn on the cob.  BJ got the Skillet Paella.  The skillet had clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops and sausage a tomato basil sauce served over rice and topped with crisp calamari.  No mess here.  He was cheating!I believe there are three very important elements for a great dining experience.  Service, atmosphere and quality food.  Joe's Crab Shack seems to get by without any of these three......LOL

Finally popped my Landmark Diner cherry this weekend. Can't believe it's taken me 9.5 years to try this place out.The menu has anything and everything. On top of that, a giant board of specials greeted us when we walked inside the door. The place was hoppin' for lunchtime Saturday.I've seen the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives episode at least a dozen times so I of course had to get the turkey, dressing and gravy. Huge serving. I took half home for lunch the next day. I'm a big fan of any meal covered in gravy. Craving some Thanksgiving? Go to Landmark and get this. The lunch portion comes with two sides. I went with green beans and a cup of vegetable soup. Loved the flavor of the soup. I will definitely get that as a side every time.Here's a rundown of what the rest of my crew ordered: -The fried chicken basket. This is quite the deal. The basket is huge. It comes with onion rings AND two sides. -Chicken pot pie. This was on the specials board and it was fantastic. Classic comfort food.-Roast pork and gravy. This was also on the specials board. Great flavor.-Fried apple sticks. Oh man, were these yummy. Ooey gooey apple goodness inside each one-Chocolate cream pie. Get it and share it. I made the mistake of ordering one for just myself. I was in a food coma when it was all said and done.My turkey lunch, pie and coffee all came to about $13. Not bad at all. I will definitely be adding Landmark to my lunch rotation.

Why are people not worshipping this place!?! Where is the Review of the Day (ROTD) for Food Shoppe?  PIttsburgh Yelpers, this place is flipping amazing, and someone needs to get the word out about the Food Shoppe.So if you've been reading my reviews, you know that my love of New York City and living in Astoria runs pretty deep.  Living in Pittsburgh makes me miss the food of Astoria greatly.  So imagine my delight when I found the Food Shoppe.  This is the closest thing to that type of neighborhood deli/ butcher you'll find in Pittsburgh.  The Food Shoppe is on my walk home, and we're going to have a beautiful relationship.  It's been cut short with the cold winter, but I will be back daily now that it is warm!Deli:  Boar's Heads meats and cheeses at the same to slightly lower prices than the grocery stores.  However, they guys behind the counter can actually make recommendations, unlike the grocery store.Create Your Own Sandwich:  Maybe the best part of this place.  You can create your own sandwich ($4.59) on fresh white, wheat, or rye bread with Boar's head meat and cheese.  At no additional cost, you can add lettuce, tomato, mayo, and/or mustard as well.  If you want extra meat, cheese, or a baguette it's only $1 more!  They have an amazing selection of meats and cheeses to chose from, which only makes it better.  I made a Buffalo chicken breast with chipotle gouda, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on rye the other day, and it was amazing.  Just trust me, and go get one!Hot Meals:  There are different daily specials of grinders, sandwiches, etc.  Plus, in the summer, they have an entire grill menu.  Pretty cool!Pizza Slices ($2):  This is what truly warmed my heart over.  For whatever reason, all of the delis near me in NYC had secret pizza ovens in the back of the store, and people would fight to get some amazing pizza out of the oven.  While this pizza isn't hidden in the back, I was super excited nonetheless!  What is better than a fresh slice of pizza?  And they'll throw it back in the oven for you to heat it up.  It's not the greatest pizza, but it's decent.Cold Prepared Foods:  Lots of cold "salads" to choose from (i.e. Ham Salad, Chicken Salad, etc.).  They are sold by the pound so make sure to think about what you order.  I got a delicious pasta salad with tortellini, but tortellini is heavy.  A single scoop was $3 and not quite worth it.  However, the ham salad was $5.99/pound and quite delicious!Take Home Prepared Meals:  There is a refrigerator with pre-made salads, pasta dinners, and other choices toward the front of the store as well.Convenience Store:  So there is all of this food, but you can also stop here for all of your basic necessities.  Laundry detergent, snacks, sodas, and basic household needs are all here!All of this and friendly employees too?  You bet!  There is a minimum purchase of $5 to use a credit card, but that seems reasonable to me.Ok, Yelpers!  Don't let me down.  UFC this review up, go visit the store, and send some love to the Food Shoppe!

I was on the Eastside late one night way out in BFE Sunrise Manor visiting a friend. We grew hungry and were craving Chinese/Mandarin food. I looked up Yelp and found Mandarin Express. I am glad we did because the service, delivery and food was Outstanding! We ordered crab rangoons, war won ton soup, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and house special chicken.The food was very hot and fresh upon delivery which was Fantastic, they don't mess around with delivery. lolA full belly is a happy belly :)

Restaurant name  Big Jim's Restaurant & Bar

Review Text :
My friend said this place was on triple D and he wanted to try it so we ended up going.  Big Jim's in the Run is essentially right in the middle of a residential zone.  It doesn't really feel like you are walking into a business at first because of the area you drove through to get there.  You will most likely end up parking on the street in front of somebody's home nearby.This place has what I call quintessential "American Italian".  What that means is that it's not necessarily Italian but rather Americanized Italian food which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's just not the same.  The first thing you will notice is that the decor is very simple.  This place is the last "D" in the title of the show, "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives".  This place is a dive and it's part of the charm of the place.  They are not trying to be anything outside of what they are besides themselves which is what makes this place genuine.  The servings at this place are really large in that one dish can maybe feed 2 people.  If each of your party orders a dish you will most likely not finish your meal.  The salads are huge, the bread comes to the table at first the entrees will fill you up big time.  The food at the same time is good as well.  The lasagna has A LOT of ricotta in it... almost too much.  The veal sandwich I ordered was almost the size of the plate!  All that being said it's not a lot of money for a lot of food.  While it's not the greatest Italian food I've had it's one of the better American Italian food places I've eaten at and I can't say you leave hungry because the portions are beyond generous to the point of being family sized.The service was very welcoming and friendly.If you follow me on the rest of my social media (HITTofMCM) then you've been waiting for this review.  I know that you come to Yelp to find out about the actual product, the Food, and I'll get to that, but Big Jims isn't just about the food no matter how good it is, it's about what this place stands for.Living in Pittsburgh my whole life I can't believe I've never been.  The building has been in the GreenField Run since the early 1900's but the restaurant opened in 1977.  I've eaten at a lot of places, I've BEEN to a lot of places, but sitting in Big Jims waiting for my food I couldn't help but feel at home, even a bit emotional from the love oozing from this place.  I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having a gentlemen by the name of Scott serve me my Bahama Mama.  He started there in 1997 and said he could never see himself working for anyone else even before they appeared on the famous food show DINERS, DRIVE INS AND DIVES.  He asked me about myself and what I do and I told him about IM SO BURGH and other things all while he tended to everyone who was there and everyone who came in as if they were all one big family.  He knew everyone by name, he knew what some people wanted before they ordered it and he and all the staff operated in a way that wasn't overly friendly and fake but, honest a bit exhausted from life and always with a smile just like it would be at home after a long day.  I told him all my Facebook family encouraged me to come here after I posted how I wanted the best Reuben Sandwich I could find in the city of Pittsburgh.  While I waited for the food he pointed out they are going through a bit of a revitalization getting new carpet put in, painting tiles and changing walls as if it was renovations in his own home.  He pointed out photos of before they were open and a big portrait of Big Jim himself looking all Tony Soprano.  He appeared to be a man who got respect and gave it just the same.  If I based this review alone on my experience and atmosphere it would get 5 stars but then my food came and as I write this, I wish Yelp had a 6 star system.My Reuben entered my place at the bar like a prize winning champion.  The Rye bread was toasted just enough to give it that crisp texture but not too much.  The sauerkraut and Swiss was just right and the thousand island dressing was just enough to marinate and flavor but the star of any Reuben is the meat and this didn't disappoint.  Thinly shaved, grilled just right with not a moment of chewiness or toughness it melted in your mouth all the way to the last bite.  Everything on the sandwich played its role like a team of ingredients should, and just in case I liked a little more Thousand Island, without even asking Scott made sure I had it right by my plate.  Each bite made me a little bit more sad because I knew it was coming to an end.  Like a night out with good friends that you wish lasted forever, that's how I felt about my closing time with this Reuben, Scott and Big Jims as a whole.I'll be back.  I promised them that. Once to take my woman to dinner and a third time to spread the word with friends.  The fourth time though, I'll need another solo visit to recapture that first visit feel all over again.  If you're from Pittsburgh or just visiting skip the chain places and head to Big Jims, they have something for everyone.Big Jim's is one of my dad's favorite places in Pittsburgh, and we ended up going here a few weeks ago.  I'm not much of a dive girl, but I actually liked this place a lot.  Located under a bridge in Greenfield, this unassuming bar puts out some massive portions at low prices.I ordered an Italian sub, and my dad got the Veal Parmesan sandwich.  I had some buyer's remorse, as my Italian sub was good but not special, and the veal parm was amazing.  The veal piece was huge and the sandwich was delicious.  They do love their condiments here so ask them to go light if you roll that wayThe service here is really pleasant and homey.  Not forced but nice.  It's a very old-school-Pittsburgh-y kind of restaurant.Once arriving, my brother pointed out that they had been on Triple D.  Who knew?  (Apparently, a lot of people on Yelp, that's who.)After cycling past Big Jim's hundreds of times over the past couple of years, I finally paid a visit this past Sat. evening at 6:30.  When a friend who enjoys large portions on the cheap wanted to go somewhere for dinner, Amanda J.'s review from last week reminded me of Big Jim's, so I suggested that we try it.Although I've always noticed several cars nearby, I was surprised at how busy it was when we stopped by.  We had to wait for a table, but we were seated in only about 5 min.  In looking at the drink menu, I noticed a cocktail called the Big Jim's cidre which appeared to be a spiced apple cider-like drink, so I decided to try it ($7.50).  I'm glad that I did, since it tasted just like a spiced apple cider with a buzz, complete with a cinnamon stick and cinnamon sugar on the rim.  It was delicious, and I could drink them all day (and night), but as it were, I showed some restraint and stuck to one.For food, I decided to go with the open faced turkey sandwich ($10.99), since the weather was cool and wet and I was in the mood for some comfort food.  It consisted of sliced roast turkey on bread and fries covered with gravy.  It reminded me vaguely of a similar roast turkey special that my college cafeteria used to serve, minus the mashed potatoes.  Nevertheless, it was pretty tasty, and definitely hit the spot for comfort food.  The one major drawback was the fries, which were clearly fried in old oil, given that they had a bitter taste.  Fortunately, the gravy helped to mask the bitterness, though.  My friend ordered the large fish sandwich ($9.99), which consisted of two huge pieces of fish on a large bun, as well as a large side of cole slaw.  The cole slaw was of the creamy variety, and contained so much mayo that it formed a pool as he ate the slaw.  He ate 75% of the fish and the bun, which impressed me, given the portion size.  Like most customers, we both took home leftovers.Overall, I was generally pleased with my experience at Big Jim's.  The clientele was definitely on the older side, and struck me as mostly consisting of Greenfield locals.  As others have said, this isn't an ideal date location due to the (lack of) decor, but it's perfectly fine for a casual dinner of comforting food on the cheap.  I'm awarding 3.5 stars because of the gross fries, but if Big Jim's could solve this problem, I'd go with a 4 instead.  While I probably won't rush back soon, I enjoyed my meal and would return the next time I'm in the mood for comfort food.

Restaurant name  HoneyBaked Ham

Review Text :
OK so this Christmas I decided to make things easy for myself in the cooking department, considering I just cooked a full on feast for Thanksgiving.I decided to have a Honeybaked ham for my Christmas dinner and I will make all of the delicious sides which would be simple!The Ham was delicious, picked it up the day before Christmas, yes waited in a 40 minute line, I was expecting that so no shock, lol.It was $38 bucks for a ham that fed 8 people a generous portion, I think it was a great deal for taste, price and convenience.You don't even have to bake or heat it up, simply pull it out and let it rest for an hour and you are ready to go. That is key that you serve this ham at room temperature!I suggest making your own sides as they are costly and in my opinion their sides are not as good as what you can do on your own. They are called Honeybaked ham for a reason and that is what you should buy :)All I had to do was my sides, green beans and bacon, brown sugar baked yams, and scalloped potatoes. It was an easy Holiday dinner and it left a lot more time for talking, snapping pics and laughing with family and friends!I will be doing a repeat of this next year for my Christmas dinner!!!I am a very happy customer!Let's get one thing straight: I am not a fan of warm ham. Thanksgiving is for turkey, not spiral-sliced. But this place is a great spot to grab lunch. Sandwiches are huge, soups are good (particularly the potato and the ham/cheese), and they have several grab and go items as well.Join their e-club for a coupon for a free ham sandwich- it's gigantic, probably what killed Mama Cass. You'll get another on your birthday. This particular location has a Yelp check-in offer for a free soda + chips, so grab a cup of soup and this can easily make two lunches for under $4. I feel like the turkey is even better than their namesake ham sando, but they're both large and fresh. The ham has a honey-mustard sauce that adds just the right amount of sweetness.Service is polite, location is clean. I won't line up around the block to buy a full size ham here, but it's not bad for lunches. They also have pies and various condiments/seasonings for sale as well.Thanksgiving shopping is DONE! We went to HoneyBaked early Sunday afternoon and got the ham and the turkey and a few fixings. Very helpful staff who walked us through what we wanted and helped us determine the right quantities. It sure isn't cheap though!This stuff doesn't have to be bought the day before, ya know? You can get it a little earlier because the line tends to grow as the holidays approach.

Restaurant name  Mr. K's Soft Ice Cream & Drive In

Review Text :
I have a very large soft spot for locally owned and operated restaurants. And this is exactly what this place is. There isn't a large parking lot or fancy entrance when you walk in. As soon as you walk in you find yourself in a tight, but yet roomy diner. Don't expect the fancy decorations or big puffed booths. You came here to get your food and eat. And that experience is worth paying for (and by paying I mean little).Nothing fancy on the menu, yet they maintain an interesting blend of options to keep you coming back. You have your burger and hot dog combos and the daily specials on their own whiteboard. The food is all reasonably priced and a combo can run for about $5.50.I came during dinner and found the place filled with construction workers covered in paint to parents eating with their ketchup faced children. I find this to be the real magic of the diner. A place where the white and blue collared can eat together without that feeling you get in some other places meant for a particular cohort. Finding a seat wasn't a problem though, so if you want to grab a seat and eat, no worries. I can imagine during the non-winter season that many people will want to eat outside on the picnic benches before catching the light rail uptown.The hot dogs and fries didn't give my taste buds anything new to think about either. There really isn't anything special about the food. It's the atmosphere and price you go here for. It's quick and pleasing service. That feeling that these owners actually give a two cents about their restaurant and reputation in the community. That's why you go here. I have yet to try their seemingly famous ice cream, so I will update when appropriate. Four stars for quality and service. Sure it isn't the best food, but it's local and a part of Charlotte.Ah, what's not to love about a good ol' Charlotte staple?!It was about time I made it in here; I'd bookmarked it months ago and literally drive by it all the time. So let's just say I was more than pumped to finally give them a try. Based on previous reviews I was ready to be amazed. And they didn't let me down! Mr. K's is said to have some of the best burgers, fries and milkshakes in town. After you fight your way to a premium parking spot (be warned parking is extremely limited) the diner itself is small.  You walk right into the grill and counter where you order. There are a few booths but when this place is super busy I'd say plan to either wait for a table or get it to go!  But a plus is that they do have some outdoor seating which I'd definitely recommend for the warmer months. I ordered a chili dog, fries and a chocolate milkshake. I just can't think of a better combination! Seriously. Chili Dog: Delish! Just enough chili and toppings to NOT leave the bun wet. You can get slaw on your dog but I opted out of that, I'm still not a fan of slaw. (I know, I know since I'm in NC I need to get used to it) Fries: Dropped HOT each order. They were hot crispy goodness. Just like they should be! Next time, I'll have to try their infamous onion rings. Milkshake: Creamy. Chocolate. Goodness. Yep. Order it every time. They have a good amount of variety of other flavors if chocolate isn't your thing but I'd make sure not to leave without having one. It was a pretty good meal. I enjoyed it and left satisfied. I can definitely see myself here a few times in the upcoming months!Coronary burger with a side of frings. Of course, the burger loaded and on an onion bun because... why not?The burger was excellent. Decent beef in there and cooked properly. Cheese, onion, tomato, ketchup and mayo. All the proper toppings for a proper burger.As much as I wanted to have one, I opted to skip the milkshake. Maybe next time, I'll drop the fries and go with the shake instead.Service was good. Be warned that they put a lot of ice in the sodas, but they do give free refills.If you're looking for a locally owned, friendly, old fashion place for a burger, hot dog or ice cream, this is the place to stop!. I've done their dogs, burgers and corn dogs so far. Still haven't actually had the ice cream. Go figure. Inexpensive but good. Friendly and fast. When I get a craving for a good grilled dog, this is my go to spot. I'm a fan for sure!I must have just not ever hit post.  There is no way that I have not reviewed this place before.  A big K, onion rings, and a shake.  I've been doing it since I was a kid.  This was literally the place where I realized that some places were just better than others in the foodie world.This no frills diner that is located next door to a strip club may not look like much from the road, but do yourself a favor and just go have a bite.  If you're looking for healthy food, go across the street to Luna's.The Big K is pretty much their version of the Wopper.  Its just better.  If I just left the gym, I might make it a double.  They have plenty of other options in general such as chili dogs, as well as diverse daily specials.There isn't table side service, but the service is plenty friendly.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Review Text :
This place has been open for so long! It might have been my first AYCE sushi too! I used to go here to satisfy my craving for tons of sushi, until I discovered Sushi Mon (which is closer to my work). This place still holds true though. The last time I went the fish was still fresh and the rolls were still delicious. The only complaint about this restaurant now is the location and the size of the place. The bathrooms aren't all that clean either.Location: This is definitely my sushi joint everyone has their own well this place is mine! I love the urban feel of this place. Its like a hole in the wall no one really knows about it but every body loves it. Like its your own secret spot :) Customer Service: is great! the servers are older Japanese women so they really treat you like their own. The chef is hilarious! Definitely if you sit at the bar expect some laughs. Food: is delicious if you love baked muscles with yum yum sauce on them this place is the best. I've tried Goyemons, sushi factory, Kaya etc and I've compared all none of them beat sushi on rainbows style. I love their Nigiri portions, big slices and little rice! Price: Great, definitely the cheapest AYCE dinner I've found and their lunch specials bento boxes are a great deal. You get so much food for $7!Being half Japanese & growing up in Japan I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi or any Japanese restaurant. Sushi on Rainbow did not disappoint. My friends indulged in my cravings and agreed to eat sushi. Not familiar with any sushi places in Vegas and one of the rare moments my friends have EVER asked me to jump on Yelp & find a place, I was stoked! Usually when I whip out my phone and start yelping it's amongst groans and moans from them. "Emy put the phone down!" "Seriously dude, do you have to yelp everything???" Sometimes I would Yelp while walking and a few times almost face planted into something. Though my friends were annoyed with my constant Yelping, they were nice enough to guide me while I was walking and typing. So yea, I was pretty happy they were turning to YELP for suggestions. This was my moment to either shine or worse - tank. Sushi on Rainbow was close to where we were at and the Yelp reviews were pretty good so I threw caution to the wind and announced, "I found the perfect place!". Fingers crossed and a silent prayer to the Yelp gods, we walk into SOR and was immediately greeted with "irrashaimase" in the right pronunciation...yeeesss, there is a Yelp god! It was AYCE sushi and other Japanese dishes such as tempura, fried oysters, curry rice, katsu etc. As some Yelpers have pointed out there is an hour time limit but this is common in Japan of any AYCE restaurant so this was not a big deal to me. I forgot how much it was per person but I did upload a couple of pics here that have the pricing on it. We all def ate and drank more than our money's worth in the allotted time.The sushi we ordered came out relatively quickly and so did the non-sushi items. I was amazed at all the things they offer for AYCE! It was delish! The night we were there, beer, sake and soft drinks were also included in the AYCE eat. After establishing who the DD was (gotta be responsible ppl) we all ordered sake.  The sushi chef's were very friendly and personable so were the waitresses. The sushi chefs would call out from time to time to ask us how we were doing. Like I said, very friendly. One of the waitresses was from my hometown in Japan and lived about 10 mins from me. It was fun talking to her in Japanese especially since my friends hardly ever hear me speak it. So yea, I got to bust out my Japanese...lol. Ok getting side tracked. I can't remember everything we ordered but the sushi was very fresh. I always start with hamachi (don't know what it's called in English) and it was very good. Salmon and maguro followed. Plus spicy tuna and a few speciality rolls. Also ordered the shrimp tempura, fried oysters and tonkatsu (pork cutlet). Yes, I'm a little oinker! One hour was plenty of time for us to fill our bellies on endless sushi and sake. Like I mentioned we hardly had to wait and the restaurant was a bit busy. The sushi counter was full when we got there and there were 3 tables that were occupied. The 2 sushi chefs both from Japan, were making the sushi and the cooks in the back were making the other dishes, This will be MUST GO TO restaurant every time I go to Vegas. Oh and btw, one of the sushi chefs was wearing a UH cap and told me they get lots of customers from Hawaii. As for converting my friends to Yelp that's another issue lol. I did score some big points on this once. (Fist pump!) Oh wait, I did convert one person, who just set up an account!If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi & food this place is the place to go. I've been to other Japanese restaurants in Vegas that were highly recommended by locals only to be disappointed that it wasn't authentic. I mean come on, shrimp tempura is not panko crusted shrimp...that's called shrimp fry. So glad I found this place thanks to Yelp. 1 point Emy / 0 points friends who I will eventually convert to becoming Yelpers. BwuahahahaCame on a Sunday for lunch. I know a lot of sushi places around the area are NOT opened for lunch. (what's up with that yo!? Can't a girl get her sushi during the day!?!) So with that said, being that Sushi On Rainbow was open for lunch automatically gave this place a 3 star. This may look like a "hole in the wall" but it satisfied my sushi fix.No trills, no frills....just come in and get your Japanese food/sushi on. The regular rolls on the menu ranges from $5-6 and each order comes with 8 rolls. The special rolls comes with two and it ranges from $8-12. Not sure if other places around the area have lunch specials on the weekend (we came on a Sunday) but this place does. My boyfriend got a beef lunch special box that comes with miso soup, salad, beef (duh), a generous portion of rice, and half an orange for your daily serving of fruit. This was $8.95 I think. And he got full off of this....so good adult sized meal. Service was great to us. Our nice little Japanese grandma took our order. I didn't know there was a lunch special for the Cali rolls and Spicy Tuna rolls that I ordered. Instead of keeping her mouth shut and just placing my order in, she told me it would be cheaper if i just got the lunch special price and it comes with my choice of soup or salad. How nice of her to tell me =) Throughout our lunch, the waitresses kept coming by to refill our drinks as well as asking how everything was.The bill turned out to be around $21 (tips not included) This may be my go-to sushi place from now on.Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting décor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a "secret menu" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is "Omakase" and they take care of everything for me. I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.3 strikes your out!It pains me to write this review, my heart actually aches.  I wanted to love this place in fact we went back 3 times to give it a shot, I don't normally do that. Sadly we left in heartbreak and will never go back.We have been to Japan, Sushi capital of the world.  We are not professionals but have traveled the world.  I have respect for those who carry that tradition over to our side of the pond.  The owner is amazing his cuts are exactly where they should be  the fish are precisely cut the rice is also perfect, he is amazing.So all that going.  Great!  well not so much.  We were treated horribly after our first trip. When we sat at the bar the owner served us the sushi was great.   The next 2 times not so much we were pushed off to the sideline. This time was busier we sat at his bar his sidekick took care of us.  Sushi is not all about the fish is is about the service, presentation and cut.  This individual had none.  No service. No presentation. and the cuts were horrible.  Fish was slopped all over the place no design or pride it looked like a serial killer left a crime scene.We wanted the owner to wait on us but it seemed he was always busy with his vips.  We Will NEVER be back.Treat everyone good and your place will be filled.  Treat one person badly and your place will be empty.  Three times you're done...Sushi on Rainbow-located next to Greenland Market. They have a sign that boldly states "Since we adhere to strict Japanese standards, our food costs are higher than other establishments which follow lesser standards" which sounds promising. Unfortunately, this place is underwhelming in many aspects.How to get any service at Sushi on Rainbow:1. Walk in and find your own seat2. If lucky enough they will swing by to ask for a drink. Tell them your drink order immediately as they rudely slap their menu on the table3. Order won't be taken unless you wave your hands.  Hands in the air, reach for the stars or imagine yourself being a butterfly trying to reach the heaven. You will get their attention eventually.FOODAs I said earlier, their sign posted all over the establishment is very deceiving. I have ordered Sushi 4 You and Sushi Combo for 2. Fish never taste fresh and this is a fact based on +20 visits. AYCE is $22.95 for lunch (with 45min limit) and $26.95 for dinner (with 60min limit). Way overpriced for their low quality items. On one of the visit, I decided to order Katsudon which turned out to be a total fail. First, it took over 30mins to get to the table. Perfect! Everyone in my group is done with their food while me and my starving stomach are waiting for the food ever since the dinosaurs existed. Finally my katsudon comes to the table and all I see is some crusty rice with katsu (breading falling apart) and egg...overall presented like a vomit. Not appetizing at all. Too much dashi or sauce used for this. Never again. CONCLUSIONI rather pay that amount at Sakana for their superior quality and fast/attentive service.

Review Text :
Structurally, the restaurant is quite charming - in a row of buildings on the national register of historic places, lots of exposed brick and tin ceilings.Lunch service is "leisurely" - not quite slow, but certainly not at a pace that will get you back to the office in an hour.The menu always underwhelms me though.  Not sure if it wants to be french (see the cheese plate appetizer which is large enough to be an entree), southwestern (several items are infused with chiles, corn, avocado or black beans) or something else.  This is a place we go once or twice a year as a change of pace.  But I can't seem to find anything compelling to bring me here more often - although I'd like to find one!Note to either server or kitchen - if the soup of the day is a Shellfish Gumbo, why put calamari in it?  Or has calamari become a shellfish?

Restaurant name  Roberto's Taco Shop

Review Text :
I once drove around for an hour trying to find this Roberto's. A little nicer and cleaner than other Roberto's but the food is the same no matter which Roberto's you stop in at. Best meal at 3am when you're belligerently drunk trying to find your way home. They always mess up my order. But whatever they give me, I finish it all. I heart the steak nacho's with extra salsa and sour cream. The best deal is the crunchy chicken taco with a chicken enchilada combo. I love how they stuff the taco with loads of shredded chicken, a little lettuce and tons of cheese.  The enchilada compliments it quite nicely.  The guacamole is processed but what the "o lay" do you expect for great mexican food at these cheap prices? Skip the beans, they aint  that great either. Tacos, enchilada's, nacho's, burrtio's, you can't go wrong ordering any of these.  Don't even think about going to Taco hell.I hear if you flash em in the drive through, it's free.

Restaurant name  Beehive Coffee

Review Text :
I won't say this a lot....but I felt slightly out of my element here.  I feel like The Beehive has probably hosted many area teenagers over the years.  Most of those teens have probably made their mark, literally, on the walls and tables of this place.  But alas, I am a teen no more.  Just trying to keep "hippity hop" like the rest of those youngins.  So for me, it's just not that type of place I can get into.  For others I'm sure it is.  Possibly a place that gets better at night...when you involve a dimly lite room, alcohol and karaoke.  Keeping it old school...like way old school...they do not take credit card.  A little irritating but I do understand that those transactions cost the owners money and I want to support the local biz scene. I did appreciate the incredibly friendly service I received from the Barista and the delicious Apple Cinnamon Iced Tea I drank in like five seconds.  I'd come back solely based on the service and to try the food.  I just don't know if I'd spend an extended period of time to say work...I may be too distracted people watching!I always hate to do this, but I feel the need to update my previous review and deduct a star in light of my experience here this past Sat.  Although I'd been to the Beehive several times before, I never realized that this coffee shop has a split personality. How, you ask?  Well, as I learned this weekend, past 10pm on Sat. (and presumably Fri., as well), the Beehive serves as overflow for the bar next door (the Rowdy Buck), which is presumably owned by the same owners.I learned about the Hyde side of the Beehive's personality when CM and I, who'd been there since around 8:30pm, were unexpectedly carded by a bouncer from the bar next door at 10pm.  CM, confused, pointed out that we were sipping on hot (non-alcoholic) beverages, to which the bouncer responded that he had to card us, per the rules of the establishment.  We obligingly got out our IDs, but were confused as to the purpose of the carding, since we'd already seen the barista ID someone who ordered a beer at the counter when we ordered our beverages shortly after arrival (the Beehive serves some alcoholic beverages--not sure if this is only during certain hours--but regardless, they were serving long before we were carded).  Soon enough, the reason for the generalized carding became evident, as noisy revelers from the bar wandered in via a doorway between the two establishments to hang out by the barista stand.  Unsurprisingly, as more of them graced the Beehive with their presence, the noise level rose exponentially, driving the people trying to get work done out to seek a quieter and less chaotic refuge.As for the drinks, CM and I were unimpressed.  I ordered the mate latte, which sounded interesting, but tasted rather bland and monotonous.  CM ordered his coffee shop standby, a cafe au lait, and was not a fan, placing it at the bottom of the ranking of the four indie coffeeshops in PGH he's tried it at to date.  I also ordered a slice of the flourless chocolate cake, which, in contrast, was excellent--very moist and chocolatey, without being overly sweet.  However, I'd guess that like most coffee shops, the Beehive procures their desserts from elsewhere--although I may be mistaken, given that their name is actually Beehive Coffee and Dessertery.To make a long story short, I'd recommend avoiding the Beehive after 10pm on Fri. or Sat., when if effectively serves as an overflow hangout for revelers from the bar next door.  At other times, I'd still recommend checking it out for its characteristically quirky ambiance and delicious baked goods, even though it may leave something to be desired in the hot beverage dept.

Restaurant name  Mickey & Mooch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Once upon a time, a party of 12 of us descended upon Mickey & Mooch to celebrate the birthday of one of our fair maidens.  Based on the restaurant's décor and lavish entrance, I was surprised to open my menu and found that the pricing on items were pretty reasonable, considering.  I had expected entrees to be higher priced.  However, we soon found that "lower" prices come with many consequences.  Drinks:  After 30 minutes of being seated, some were still waiting for their beverages.  When they finally received their bottles of beer, they were "as is."  No glass.  What kind of "upscale" restaurant serves beer without a glass?  We weren't sitting at the bar; we were in the dining room.  One of the beers was a Blue Moon brought in its bottle.  Don't the bartenders know that Blue Moon is always traditionally served with an orange slice?  It's like serving a lime with a Corona.  Someone else ordered a martini.  It was sloshed around as it was set down in front of him.  He had to wipe up the spillage by himself.  Bread:  Bread was served but it was cold (like it was taken out of a freezer and not fully thawed).  They asked to have the half-frozen bread taken away and replaced with "warm" bread at least twice; it never came during the entire two and a half hours we were there.  Salads:  We asked if we could get something besides a regular garden salad.  Our server advised a Caesar salad or Wedge in its place.  We were never told that there was a significant upcharge to getting a slightly different salad.  $2.95 for the Caesar, $3.95 for the Wedge..the same cost if you ordered them separately.  When this was brought to the attention of our server at the end of the meal, he brushed it off.  I'm guessing it happens a lot at the restaurant.   The salads arrived & we had to ask for silverware (for the 2nd time).  Several minutes passed and I finally got up and swiped them off an empty table.  Minutes after we had started using the newly acquired silverware and eating our salads, the server finally returned...with ONE set of silverware.  I guess we were supposed to share?Entrees:  Our entrees arrived halfway through the salads.  After delving into the entrees, several people had puzzled looks on their faces.  Some had ordered their steaks medium rare or medium.  They came out with raw meat in the middle.  And not just a small portion; it was golfball-sized.  Medium rare means pink with some reddish tones; not raw.  Worse, one person ordered pork.  It, too, had a golfball-sized red raw center.  Trichinosis, anyone?  At this point, we called over a manager.  When the raw pork was displayed to her, she tried to tell us that it was "fat."  Red fat?  In the middle of a pork cut?  Being served the raw pork is one thing.  Passing it off as acceptable by a manager is poor crisis management.  All of the undercooked meats were taken away to "re-cook" or replace.  The steaks were returned within a few minutes; the pork wasn't.  With the plates that were taken away for the steaks were the side items that everyone had ordered.  These were not returned on the plates and had to be "re-ordered" by us specifically requesting them from the server and/or manager.   One friend ordered drawn butter with his salmon.  It didn't come until he was halfway through the salmon, about 15 minutes later.  Halfway through my meal, I finished my glass of wine and ordered another glass.  It didn't come until I was through with my entrée and the plate had been cleared.  Great timing...and I'm not a fast eater.   After everyone finished eating and plates were cleared, the "new" pork finally arrived.  Bill:  Did I mention the Wedge salad that was on my bill after everything we went through and it was brought to the attention of the server that we were never advised about the upcharge?  After all our problems, getting the bill with all the additions was like a kick in the head after being punched in the stomach for a couple of hours.  Summary:  I'm just telling you the story from my side of the table.  I don't even know everything that went on at the other side of the 12-person table.  I only gathered stories here and there.  It wasn't just one error.  It was one after another.  It wasn't just one person at the table.  It was practically everyone who had a problem.  When the numerous errors were brought to their attention, the errors were not handled in an appropriate manner by the waitstaff or the management team.  The biggest problem of the night was that nobody seemed to care whether we had a poor experience or not.  The kicker was that afterwards I wrote a 3-page letter to Mickey & Mooch corporate...and got no response.  They apparently didn't care either.  So I guess they won't care if I take my money elsewhere. The End.  Happily Never After.

Restaurant name  Price's Chicken Coop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
What a bummer! So I moved to Charlottes Historic Southend last week and knew right away that I had to try the ever-raved about Price's Chicken Coop. I had high expectations- since Ive heard nothing but great things about this place.  I went this Saturday for lunch and ran into a crowd (expected) but I heard the line went fast- and just figured it was a good sign! After about 15 minutes of fully-expected wait time I made my selection the 1/4 lb white chicken meal complete with a roll, hushpuppies, and coleslaw for only $6!I walked down to the Common Market to grab a drink and sit outside to eat my meal- (CM rocks by the way!) ...When I actually ate my chicken I was more than disappointed. While I am never one to completely disregard an eating establishment because its a so-called hole in the wall (as this is) I do expect it to be sanitary. I immediately encountered a large black curly hair (that was definitely not mine) ... I was so disgusted- I put that piece in the garbage and tried to regain some of my appetite  and at least give the other piece a try. The chicken was fairly dry and definitely nothing special. There wasn't a lot of meat at all - and Ive had better chicken at KFC  which isn't saying much. ...The Coleslaw had no carrots or anything and was ok in flavor- basically a sweet watery-mayonnaise shredded cabbage mixture...nothing great. The highlight of the meal were the hushpuppies- which were perfect in every way.I do feel like I will give this one more chance since everyone else claims it's so great...maybe I just had one outlying bad experience.Why the 5 stars you say? Prices never disappoints me. They are ALWAYS consistent. I can actually eat their chicken cold and still be happy. The customer base is super eclectic. The restaurant is subjectively charming and how can you not smile when you see people with shirts and ties sitting on the street curb eating chicken? As we know there isn't anything special about fried chicken. Don't go buying fried chicken expecting some elaborate 20 step preparation process. Its just fried chicken. But fried chicken is comforting for everyone and always induces some type of nostalgia. Its a simple dish and Prices does it right: Moist, tastes like chicken and not overwhelmed with spices or anything, and lastly crispy batter. They don't have real sides here. Just slaw, potato salad, taters and hush puppies. Although they offer other menu items, I only get chicken usually. Gizzards (yuck) are okay here too. =) Thighs are just too greasy for me and breasts are too meaty. I like a 30% meat, 70% skin/batter mixture. So I'm a wing kinda guy and Price's has damn good crispy wings. My only complaint is that they chop off the wing tips. Yes I said it, I love wing tips! I'm still waiting for them to offer fried chicken skin. lolPopped in to give this place a try as I've heard nothing but good things about their chicken. And the raves are correct. This is really good chicken. A meaty chicken breast that was moist with a very crispy batter that wasn't so thick that it overwhelmed the chicken.I got a two piece dinner, which came with a dinner roll, a small tub of cole slaw, some tater tots, some hushpuppies and the previously mentioned chicken - one wing and one breast. The tots were excellent. Not too greasy at all, but I was glad to have the one packet of ketchup for dipping.This was a serious "fried" plate. If they could fry the cold slaw and the dinner roll, I'll bet they would have done so.Note: This place is TAKE OUT ONLY. There is no dining area that I could see.Thinking about eating here? Consider this first. The owner of Price's is likely the scummiest businessperson in the United States that I have had the displeasure of knowing existed. Sure, his chicken is actually not bad, but hear me out.If you park in the private lot for Price's after 6pm, YOUR CAR WILL GET BOOTED OR TOWED. No exceptions, EVEN FOR CUSTOMERS. It's absurd to think that there are people like this in a first world country who would hire his own towing truck service in order to extort people, including his actual customers, out of $50.If you care just one bit about where your money goes, DO NOT EAT HERE.

I usually ignore stars on here and go straight for the meat, the review itself, so I would urge you to do the same. Here are some things Barriques has going:1. Darn good iced coffee. 2. You don't have to sign a CC merchant copy.3. Uhm wine wall anyone? 4. Get a slice of pumpkin chocolate chip bread. Really. 5. You know that wine wall?Here are some things that need attention: 1. Been three times, each time tables were dir-tay. (That's dirty with attitude). 2. Floor needs a scrubbin'. 3. After I wash my hands in the men's room, I want to wash my hands.(notice a theme?)My vote... go for the iced coffee, wine wall, pumpkin chocolate chip bread, wine wall, wine wall, and the wine wall and take your goods to go. Yo.

==A Slice Of You==A romantic comedy by Jetta(The dimly lit pavement of a strip mall parking lot. JETTA, a glamazon in her early twenties, stares longingly into the night. An alluring ingenue with a dark and questionable past, she shivers in 90 degree night, tears forming in her eyes. Behind her is PIZZA PATRON, a tall, fedora-wearing gentleman. He sports a mustache that doesn't play by the rules. JETTA knows he is behind her.)JETTAI'm sorry. I just can't.PIZZA PATRONWhy can't you let me love you, Jetta?JETTABecause there's nothing left of me to love. I've been burned before. Lured by promises of reasonably priced large one-toppings and hearty, flavorful hot wings. Only to be given hot plates of garbage and crunchy and disturbingly misshapen wings of what I can imagine were once, long before growth hormones, in fact chickens. I don't known if I can trust you.PIZZA PATRONBut I'm not like the others.JETTAThey all say that. I like you, PP. I like your logo depicting a Federale whose about to cut me open and empty my stomach of all that cocaine I spent all morning stuffing in. I like how you scream "PIZZA PATRON!" at the top of your lungs to me whenever I step in the store. I like your queso sticks and chorizo-topped pizza. I even like how you accept pesos in lieu of dollars, no matter how many shithead right-wingers boycott and protest your storefront. Don't you see? I like you. If I open my heart to you, I could risk hating you. Can't we just settle for "like"?PIZZA PATRONWhat would be the point? Why offer a 4.99 large one-topping if the box isn't going to litter your living room floor. Why offer lime and pepper-flavored chicken wings if I can't know that somewhere, it's you're lips sucking the meat off the bone? Don't you see, Jetta? Without you taking advantage of my ridiculously underpriced food, there'd be no reason to make it in the first place. I don't know how else to say this--JETTAShhh. You had me at "$4.99 one topping". (The two embrace. Music plays dramatically in the background.)Somebody put a stop to me. Please.Actually the $3.99 pizza from Pizza Patron looked pretty darn good when I opened the box. It was hot but I noticed immediately, no pizza aroma! Adequate amount of pepperonis and cheese and the crust looked good too but had absolutely no flavor...none! Like a generic pizza..Possible imitation cheese, pepperonis, sauce and dough. I sprinkled copious amounts of garlic salt/powder and crushed red peppers all over it to give it some flavor. I guess if you don't mind doing that it's worth $3.99. Prob better to go across the street to Little Caesar's for $4.99! The star is for me and my seasoning additions! Haha Could give another star for convenience but parking is bad!

Review Text :
This is near our house, so we like to pop in. The outdoor seating is great in summer, and the tropical menu is fun on a cold, winter day.Food is okay. Nothing I particularly crave between visits, but it is nicer than most waterfront joints where you can park a boat. I do enjoy the house salad. Strangely, it comes with a little side cup of chocolate chip cookie dough. I don't know why they include this, especially since cookie dough contains raw egg (I'm surprised there isn't some code they are violating), but I happen to love chocolate chip cookie dough and I can't wait to eat it with my salad.I tried something different tonight: curry chickpea and lentil stew. It was pretty good! I can't stand cilantro and was able to order the entree without it.My husband had a massive cheeseburger, which he loved. I can attest the fries were great as well. They leave some skin on and use a lot of salt. Yum.Now for the reasons this is a two star review instead of higher:The outdoor seating process is a complete cluster. If you enter the front door at the hostess stand and ask for an outside table, they tell you to go outside to be seated. OK, no problem. We'll go outside.Outside, we were told all tables were full and to go INSIDE to get a pager from the hostess. We saw open tables near the outdoor bar and asked if we could eat at those tables. The waitress said those were first come, first serve, and we could eat dinner there. She was very friendly about it, "Yes, they'll give you menus there and take care of you, but you just have to order from the bartender because there is no table service."We were good with that and grabbed a table. I went to the bar for menus and I was told we could only order appetizers in the bar section. I explained the waitress had just told us we could order off the full menu. Bartender's response: "Oh, was that the one in the orange shirt?" Me: "No, it was someone in a blue shirt." I'm not sure why that mattered but should not have been the response. Bartender says we have to go inside for a pager to get a table. By this time more customers are ahead of us in line. On a Saturday night, every place we'd visit with patio seating would be busy, so we decided to get a pager and wait.I get a pager from the inside hostess stand. I will skip writing about the conversation between the hostess and the waitresses since this review is getting long. However, I will note the person who had just told me we could order off the full menu at the outdoor bar was there and I told her we had just learned we had to get a regular table to order from the full menu. Her reply, "Oh, sorry, I forgot."We then go back to the outside bar to wait for the pager to buzz.Surprisingly, it only took about 10 minutes for a table to become available. I go back to the outdoor hostess stand, walking by one of the three open tables we'll be seated at, and the waitress tells me I have to take my pager back inside before she will seat me. I just about lost my mind at this point!!! I keep my head cool and level, despite my frustration. I walk BACK into and through the restaurant to drop off the pager. The hostess says thanks and tells me to go back outside and find a waitress to seat us. Restaurant Manager: if you read this review, please fix this process! All the burden of finding a table is on your customers. Hire a real hostess for outside and either give her a stack of pagers or have her commit to memory who is on the wait list. I cannot believe how disorganized this was. The Nau-ti-Gal owners have owned restaurants in Madison for decades. This is rookie performance.

Review Text :
Ohhh yes. My kind of place. Raggedy, but some pretty delicious duck. I'm an avid patron of this 'restaurant' as I come here and order full ducks often. If you have never had duck, I would recommend you to try it out as its just tasty.Anyways lets get to it. This place is located right off central in a little corner across the street from the gas station and such. It's a very small spot as its truly just a take out spot. Not quite a dine in place. They have pretty authentic Chinese dishes as when you go in you can see their menu of some bizarre things. Also, I wanted to note their sanitary score. Even though its an A, it's not an high A. I think it's not bad considering what they prepare. Stick to the duck, and you will have no issues. The prices are very reasonable as I have been to other duck restaurants and it seemed to be really expensive.Overall, this place is a pretty good place for some authentic duck with a reasonable price. Take out, take home, and eat it with rice or bread... Awesome.

Brads is cheap and the fish and sides are all frozen pre-breaded. I pop thru the drive thru every now and then because its cheap and easy and on my way home.The catfish is OK. it's thin and flat? Never saw a flat catfish before. Not a lot of flavor. This is normal for Brad's trust my ex used to get the fish and fried zucchini all the time. I do like their tarter sauce it is tasty. It's weird if you go in they have all of these display cases to sell you trinkets from Asia. But looks a little like a cafeteria. They have everything fried you can think of. Fish, shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings, fries you get the idea. If you want great catfish go to Honey bears on central Thursdays or Fridays only.We have been going to Brads for over 15 years. It really has not changed much. The interior is blah.The staff is strange yet nice.The food is ok to good. Everything is breaded and fried but the breading is good. The cod fillet was meaty and good.  It was just too much grease after the rings and fish. It was 27 for 4 of us...not too bad.

I was hekka hungry today and my friend suggested we go here. We rounded up the apartment troops and hopped in his Hummer around 8pm. There was no wait and we were the last ones to come in just before closing. I was a bit worried since it was a party of 8 and it was so late but we basically ended up with the 2 servers to ourselves after the rest of the customers left. 99 cent margaritas all summer!! WTH and they were not in miniature glasses either!! OMG I saw customers with mi cheladas and other giant margs. Their chips were fresh and hot not greasy or salty. The salsa could have used more bite to it but the kids enjoyed it as well as the bean dip that I couldn't stop eating. My friends son had the waitress's wrapped around his finger they were very attentive and kept stopping to get kisses from the little guy. The men had the carne asada plates that were ginormous and left nothing behind. I had the enchiladas suiza's and my partner in crime had the fajitas. Mine was good there wasnt really any heat to it but the chicken was cooked perfect. It was all really good I cant wait till I'm hungry again for leftovers. The little ones had pizza's and fries it kept them entertained and their meals included ice cream for dessert. I was really impressed by how nice the staff was way after closing time and they never made us feel like we needed to hurry. They made sure the margs were constantly flowing. The menu had everything but tamales I think. I will be going back to try this hibiscus infused marg it sounded delish!! Party of 8 the bill came to $107 not bad at all! P.S. If you happen to like Coronas they are $1.25 on Tuesdays.During my mercado shopping day this week my husband was craving Mariscos ala Mexico and our pal Tom knew just the place. This little hole in the wall has all the right signs as you walk in the clientele is made up  of a wide slice of phoenix from  your  people on office lunch breaks , abuelas  with their famillias  and average types like myself.  We ordered seafood inspired Mexican food like shrimp enchiladas  , fish tacos (good but nothing to start a talk thread about )  and sopa de mariscos ..very tasty!   The chips were very fresh and the guacamole and salsas mucho yummo.     word of warning they put a jalepeno butter on just about every entree, for those that dont know oil  spreads the heat in peppers ..so your food is spicy!I will definitely be back again  to try the sopa again .

Review Text :
Why is Laura M., PGH's intrepid reviewer of hidden gem, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, reviewing a chain casual dining restaurant like Houlihan's?  Well, like many people, I ended up at Houlihan's at the behest of a friend (who I hadn't seen for months) for her birthday, along with a large group. (Said friend received a $15 off coupon for her birthday, hence her incentive to come.)  Quite frankly, I came for the company, with low expectations for the food, and those expectations were met.As soon as we walked in, I noticed a strange, slightly unpleasant smell that I couldn't quite put my finger on, which I later determined to be emanating from the restroom.  We stood at the hostess stand for several minutes before someone acknowledged us, and then we waited several more minutes while she put some tables together, during which time we were awkwardly greeted by another hostess. When we were finally seated, we inquired about the happy hour, and our waitress told us that we had to go to the bar to purchase drinks and apps at the happy hour price.  So, we awkwardly got up a few at a time to get our drinks, and ended up getting regular apps.  Per the bartender's recommendation, I got the raspberry long island iced tea ($5.75, HH price), which I thought was a glass, but turned out the be a liter.  Though I've never had a long island before and don't have any standard of judgment, it was cloyingly sweet and wasn't strong at all, since I didn't feel tipsy in the slightest even after drinking the entire liter.  I tried several different variants ordered by my friends, and they were all very sweet and not very strong--the only drink I thought had a better balance was the angry orchard cocktail.For food, we ordered several appetizers to share between us: parmesan frites, "shrooms," and pretzel sticks.  They were all predictably mediocre and salty, with little depth of flavor.  In particular, I was not a fan of the bier cheese, which had a strange aftertaste, or the horseradish sauce incorporated into the shrooms.  For my entree, I ordered the quiche Lorraine with a cup of potato soup, which came with it ($11.95).  To my surprise, the potato soup wasn't salty--if anything, it was bland and underseasoned, such that I added some salt and pepper to spice it up.  The quiche was okay, but nothing very special--I'd definitely had much better renditions elsewhere.  I felt that the amount of food that I received for the price was lacking.  Several other members of our group ordered flatbreads, including my friend who sat next to me, who ordered the gluten free version.  Her flatbread was served at room temperature, such that she sent it back to the kitchen to be warmed up.  To their credit, the kitchen remade it and the manager comped it--but at the end of the day, this shouldn't have happened in the first place.Needless to say, I was less than impressed with the quality of food and drinks that I received from Houlihan's, especially given the price (total check: around $20 w/ tip), not to mention that you have to pay for parking (you're looking at around $5 for a couple of hours).  I'd never been to a Houlihan's before, and to be honest, I doubt I'd return.  There are many restaurants with more character and better--and less expensive--drinks and bar food not far away on East Carson St., including Piper's Pub, Fat Heads, and the Smiling Moose, to name just a few.  Experiences like this are why I always try to talk my friends (and boyfriend!) into trying somewhere new, and avoiding chain casual dining whenever possible, esp. given the richness of the dining scene in PGH.  2.5 stars.

Review Text :
Last night, upon taking off work, I was super-hungry and was craving a (hot) sandwich, so I decided to head over to Uncle Sam's.  Since most of the menu options appeared to be variations on cheesesteaks, I decided to go with a basic chicken cheesesteak ($8.13 w/ tax), given that I don't eat beef.  From reading other Yelp reviews, I knew the sandwich came with free fries for dine in, so I mentioned that I wanted to do this.When my sandwich and fries came out after about 10 min., they looked very fresh and tempting, so I was excited to dig in.  When I did so, I was underwhelmed, however.  The bread was light and fluffy, rather than substantial, as I prefer, the tomatoes were pretty white, and the chicken was on the tough side.  The flavors were so muted and bland that I sequestered all of the condiments (hot sauce, cajun spice, brown mustard) and put them to use, which significantly improved the sandwich.  As for the fries, they were of the previously frozen shoestring variety (I saw the box)--similar to McD's fries, but not as crisp--and were utterly forgettable sans condiments.Interestingly, this place seems to be a haven for single male grad students during the dinner hour.  In the 30 min. or so I was there, I was the only female who ate in--all of the other diners were solo men in their mid-twenties with textbooks in front of them. In contrast, there were plenty of women, couples, groups, etc. dining at Noodles and Co. a block away. Maybe cheesesteaks for dinner are a dude thing?At the time of my visit, I found the dining area acceptably clean, and the service friendly and fairly efficient.  This is likely due to the time of my visit (5:30pm), however, since Uncle Sam's is probably much more popular at lunch time.  Thus, YMMV.Given that I'm from DE, where Capriotti's originated, I have exacting sandwich standards, and I have yet to find a place in PGH that satisfies them.  While Uncle Sam's is a cut above Subway, it isn't quite as good as Peppi's, which I also found underwhelming, despite its good reputation.  Thus, my search for a satiating sandwich continues...

Great Scott! I traveled back in time and didn't need a Delorean OR 1.21 jiggawatts of electricity! All I needed to do was eat at the Beef and Bottle.  Old school? Based on the wood paneling and framed, yellowed photos of such greats as Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra and, who is that? Bert Convy?, the Beef and Bottle was settled and collecting dust when Old School was in kindergarten. Sure, it's not exactly SWANK (the piano bar seems more converted trailer/walled in patio than anything), but I'm not exactly a swank cat. I tend to travel the other side of the tracks. (And by "other side," I mean the underneath.) To wit, I thought the strange rear entrance, the presence of barbed wire and, yes, the wood paneling, actually were POSITIVES rather than negatives.The food? Tasty. Not too expensive. Actually the steaks were priced around those of Longhorn and Outback rather than a Ruth Chris. However, the sear and crust on my ribeye were superior to those chain joints, so point goes to B&B. The meat was cooked to spec, medium rare. Sure, the most nouvelle the menu gets is the presence of shrimp, but hey, sometimes the occasion calls for a salad of iceberg lettuce and gloppy ranch dressing. That last sentence sounds insulting, but I assure you aspiring Foodie Douches, it is not. I meant it with great sincerity.In fact, the only thing I found to gripe about was the intensely low lighting made the menu difficult to read though, I'm sure, it makes your date much more attractive. I'll give Beef and Bottle a solid 4 stars. I think I'll be coming back when I return to town.Truly looks like a strip club from the street. Would never have walked in to the place were it not for Yelp. The experience is a bit schizoid. You enter through the rear parking lot into an atrium and then pass through down a step in to a dark dining area. Our greeter looked approximately 16 and didn't quite fit in the overall club-y vibe they seem to be going for.Similarly schiz-y were the customers who were dressed in date nite dinner-out clothes as well as shorts and t-shirts. I am not sure who the target market is as there were small kids around, which seemed out-of-place, as well as middle-aged couples who were clearly regulars.Food is steakhouse circa 1972. Dishes are straight up what-you-see-is-what-you-get. What they do, they do well but there are absolutely no surprises.  Steak or shrimp, salad, potatoes and some kind of side veggie.Didn't try the desserts as we were stuffed from the meal.Overall service was pleasant and well-modulated.  Not sure if this is a place to take a date as it is solid, but not stellar.Loved this place, I love supporting the local restaurants as apposed to the larger steak chains in the area (cough cough: Sullivan's, Flemings, etc...) This place looks like an old Pennsylvania lodge from the 80's playing rat pack music - kind of cool. Service was excellent!! (oh - and 1/2 price bottles of wine on Thursdays!) Here is what was ordered: cheese spread at table - awesome oysters Rockefeller - perfect salad - average steak fillet medium rare - PERFECT and tasty!! lobster - above average and delightful scallops - local from Virginia and perfect baked potato - loaded and yummy! chocolate dessert - average key lime pie - really great! I would go back for sure!Ok, I must admit I have driven by this place a million times and had decided I was never going there based on the fact there were no windows and it sorta looked like a strip joint from the outside....My husband who has is iphone glued to his hand at all time loves looking up reviews of things before we go someplace and suggested we try this.  I was skeptical.  We pulled in and went in the back which is the main entrance.  It's dark, not very fancy, and there's Sinatra music blaring. We were seated and given a basket of crackers to spread with delicious cheese spread.  Then we were given a lettuce salad and a tray of veggies to sort of "make your own" salad.  I ordered steak tips with mushrooms and peppers and had rice pilaf as my side.  My husband had the sirloin with a sweet potato.  Both were amazingly good!  The steak was cooked perfect and had been basted in garlic butter (no calories!)  For our whole dinner it was only like $17 per person including the salad, oh and they have this amazing garlic toast!  You must have some if you go.I was definitely not psyched about going but the experience and the food will have me coming back again!I still think this is the best place to get a steak in Charlotte. Bold statement... right?If you haven't been here, there's a good chance you have passed right by it and not even realized what it is. My mom actually asked if it was strip club. It's not fancy. When you walk inside, you feel like you stepped into an episode of the Sopranos. Very old school feel.What to order: Appetizers: you really can't go wrong with any them. Keep in mind though... you have a lot of food coming.Meal: The specials are all really good. However, you absolutely can not go wrong with the filet and shrimp scampi combo. The filet cuts like butter. The shrimp.. perfection. Bonus: dinner comes with a side and salad. At most steakhouses, both are extra. The salad spread comes to your table. You get to make your own. All the dressings are homemade. Feeling naughty? Get the blue cheese. Every calorie is so worth it.Dessert: I don't care how full you are. Get apple pie with cinnamon ice cream.Deal alert: Mondays and Thursdays you can get half off glasses and bottles of wine.Service is top notch. If you want to do a Friday or Saturday, you may want to call ahead to make a reservation. They get pretty busy.I debated on the 5th star, but you know what?  The Manager asked me if there I was anything he should change and I told him "Please don't change a thing, you can only mess it up".  Concerning the commentary about how it looks from the outside:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Yeah, it has some "Mafia hideout place to bring your mistress maybe it's really a strip club" look to it - but if you haven't figured it out by now, that IS part of the charm and the appeal.  One reviewer here thinks none of the clientele are locals.  Perhaps he is clairvoyant, but I don't think it is possible to make such a claim.Pricey?  Not really.  Making comparisons to Outback?  You should probably stick with Outback.To start - our waitress (also the bartender) Hillary made me one of the better Old Fashioneds with Dark Rum I've had.  She left out the orange but it was still pretty great.  Now she knows she has Myers on hand, too. We had "the cheese" but with Panini bread instead of crackers.  Sounds silly, I know.  I thought the cheese was to die for, and the danger here is eating too much of it.  Next time I will eat the cheese with a spoon when no one is looking.  The bread is crazy good, too.  There is a reason they bring this out to your table when you are seated - it's tastes really good.We also had French Onion Soup, Salad with Blue Cheese, Shrimp Scampi (prepared perfectly), Trout (perfect), Ribeye (it was hard to resist licking my plate in public when it was gone), Creamed Spinach (awesome) and Mushrooms.  (I love mushrooms, but these are prepared in a wine sauce, wheras I am more of a garlic butter fan).We had a hard time choosing a bottle of wine, but we described what we were looking for and another waiter made a recommendation - it was spot on.  I think it may be crowded on Mon and Thurs for half-priced wine nights, so remember you probably need a reservation any night of the week.  When we were leaving a van full of seniors showed up with no reservations.  The Manager was trying to accommodate, and I hope they were able to work it out but...trust me, make a reservation.We had to skip the dessert this time, but it was tempting.We thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, and sincerely hope it doesn't change a bit.  We are new fans and cannot wait to go back.  To anyone who didn't like it, you should probably stick with chain restaurants.

Review Text :
So I have to admit that I am an Indian food snob. I went to school in NYC and ate on 6th street (aka Curry Row) 2 to 3 times a week, because it was cheap and tasty. Once I got a job and had a little cash to spend, I scoured Queens for the best buffets and samosa stands. I'm a little nuts about Indian.That being said, this is one of the reasons I'm culinarily comfy in Charlotte. Better than 90% of the Indian I've eaten, it's reasonably priced, traditionally spiced, has a fascinatingly diverse menu (Dosa's are amazing, and so are the curries! Their Szchecuan dishes taste like high-end chinese! CRAZY), and a sweet, if tho often harried, waitstaff. Very importantly: they trust you when you ask for "very spicy". If you tell them fry-me spicy, it comes out fry-me, crying, happy spicy. I can't tell you how often this is NOT the case, although my fellow Indian food snobs will understand how frustrating this can be.Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands-down.Woodlands always comes through for vegetarian Indian.  Even for the biggest lover of meat , vegetarian Indian is the best.  It is so good and spicy you don't even miss your favorite meat products.  If you haven't tried Indian food, I like to order a lot and eat family style.  So if it is a first visit bring a couple of people with you, so you can order more food. The menu is daunting at first glance, if you aren't familiar with Indian food, some of my favorites are the okra and tomatoes, chickpeas in tomato sauce, cheese in tomato sauce, eggplant - there are always plenty of lentil dishes.  Once when you get the Indian words down, you find your favorites fast.  Don't forget to order bread.  It is the most important part for dipping!  If you like it spicy- remember to tell them, because it is so much better spicy.  I might suggest ordering everything medium and one dish spicy, so then you can see what your comfort level is.  Woodlands is not much to look at - this restaurant is begging for a makeover, it could be so cute, but it is so broke down.  In fact, I prefer  take away rather than dining in.  If you judge restaurants by their restrooms, don't even go in.  Woodlands has awesome food.I tried out Woodlands on the recommendation of a friend (who happens to be a vegetarian) with a group of girls on President's day as we all had it off of work. I'll be honest - I've not had great experience with Indian food, but this restaurant completely changed my mind. It was literally the best pure vegetarian food I've ever eaten. We decided to get the full experience and share a bunch of dishes around the table. Here's a list of what we ordered: Appetizers Samosa Chaat - chopped samosa topped with wheat crispies, yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney - this was literally the best item I had at lunch. It was the perfect blend of texture and flavor and set the bar high for the rest of our meal. Dahi Batata Puri - cripy dough topped with yogurt, potatoes and chutney - very delicious but also quite rich. Lunch Pesarat Masala Dosa - green lentil crepe - this came out looking like a huge pancake, and it was almost as delicious. The dipping sauces were quite good and gave the crepe a bit more flavor. Chana Batura - large puffy bread (think elephant ear with no cinnamon/sugar) with chana masala (chickpeas in delicious sauce) - great item for someone who has never tried (or says they don't like) Indian food. It had great seasoning but wasn't too spicy. The bread was great with everything we had on the table. Palak Paneer - spinach and home made cottage cheese with tomatoes, onions and spices - my second favorite thing we ordered - I paired it with the puffy bread just to change things up a bit. That puffy bread is good with everything. Gobi Manchurian with gravy - marinated cauliflower sauteed with ginger, garlic, green onions and soy sauce - the sauce was absolutely divine. Gobi Paratha - whole wheat bread stuffed with cauliflower, potatoes and spices - this was my least favorite item we ordered as it was very spicy (even though the menu says "mildy spiced"). It was still good...but something had to be my least favorite, and this was it. Parking was not a problem and it's not too far from uptown. The food has no trans-fat and there is an organic menu available. Tables don't turn over very quickly, so the restaurant seemed full the entire time we were there. I highly recommend this restaurant and will be going back soon to try out some new dishes.Ok ok....So, these guys aren't the easiest to find, get to, track down, locate, etc, but the journey far exceeded my expectations. On the outskirts of Eastland, it's not the prettiest area, but I dig the trudgery it took to experience the flavorful onslaught. It's purely vegetarian/vegan. Not a whisper of meat was found in our food. Started with the pea/potato samosas and garlic naan. Perfectly executed. The sauces served alongside were lovely. Spicy and pungeant. I'd order these again, but would look forward to trying another variety. The garlic naan was legendary. Chewy, charred in places, and kicked so much flavorful ass.For entrees, we went with Chana Masala and the Paper Dosa. Masala was absolutely wonderful -- served with jasmine rice. The Paper Dosa.....just look at my photos or anyone else's. It's like a joke. So massive and hilariously served on a medium sized plate. It's a crepe-like bread with a potato mash on the base of the plate and a few dipping sauces. It's one of the most versatile Indian dishes I've experienced. the sheer size of the dish will stick with you for the rest of your life. However, the flavors are wonderful and earthy. I'd order it again in a heartbeat. Service was efficient, but they did seem to exude the "you're inconveniencing me right now" sort of attitude a few times. Not a huge deal, but it did make use the eatpayleave strategy.Would I go back? Hell yes. Will I get Paper Dosa again? Hell yes. Am I stoked to explore the menu further? Oh....hell yes. Count me in as a part of the Woodlands fanclub.My review was written four years ago, so I thought it was time for an update.  Still solid four stars, bathrooms have been remodeled, many owner changes and currently service is a little slow, but if you know this going in and you are in a good mood you can certainly tolerate it.  We meet at 5p on the dot, order starters and a bottle of wine immediately, but if you don't know this, you might be sitting there a little while.  If you like spicy food be sure to specify because they will tone it down for you.  Especially if you are getting take away tell them HOT or they will write medium down.  Even with crazy service, I don't care, Woodlands remains one of my favorite restaurants in the Queen City.

Remember that scene in Lady and the Tramp with the spaghetti...don't lie. you remember. Anzios always reminds me of that scene. Small, quaint, the little checkered table cloths. Its adorable.They have great pizza. there is something special about the crust and thick cheese that they use and the mild yet tasty sauce. The salads are always perfectly chilled, perfect lettuce. The hotwings are making my mouth water thinking about them.The service has always been terrific. I have been going for years and have not had one single bad experience. They are prompt and friendly but not clingy to the table. and Its been awhile but 30 cent wing night was always something a little special.I like the comparison to Lady & the Tramp that Nathan S. made in his review. This place totally reminds me of that scene too with the red & white checkered table cloths.The service at Anzio's is usually very good.The salads are very good.The bread is good.The pizza and the other dishes are just ok.The beer selection is lacking, no good micro-brews (get some Sierra Nevada, New Belgium beers or at least some Four Peaks, would ya?)And that's all I've got to say about thatWent to lunch on a Sunday with some girlfriends, and they picked Anzios, found out that the place has been in business for 28 years, I love small local places!  And it looks like fellow Phoenicians love it too!   I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and added chicken to it, the creamy alfredo sauce has some great flavor, couldn't get enough of it, even used the garlic bread to mopped it up, oh soo yummy! The noodles cooked perfectly and the chicken tender and tasty! The garlic bread was perfectly toasted & soaked up sauce beautifully!  The side salad was crisp & fresh, a perfect little salad.Our server Gus made sure that we were taking care of, very friendly and helpful!  I love local places & great service!  I will be back!

Review Text :
Finally made it in to Cajun Yard Dog! This place can be a bit tricky with getting a table! Quaint inside, popular for sports fans and great food can pack out the inside in no time flat. My wife and I ventured in for an early-ish dinner on a Saturday night. The menu houses a phantasmagorical array of Cajun choices. Etouffe, jambalaya, seafood....all choices apropos for the bayou-seeking culinaries. First, we ordered a few drinks and an app. Great beer choices. Red Oak from outside of Greeensboro, and Abita root beer. If you haven't had Abita's root beer, you must. It's incredibly flavorful and not overtly laden with sassafras. The house-made chips are wondrously prepared. A little more done than most, served with herb sour cream and a BBQ cream. The BBQ cream is faint and sweet and the herb is much more pungent.My wife ordered a menagerie of side items. Veggies, Mac n' cheese, fried okra and jalapeno cheese grits...oh, those grits. They are incredibly creamy and packed with flavor(s). All were fantastic. I had the chicken jambalaya. A HEAPING plate of jambalaya packed with chicken, smoked summer sausage, rice, spices and a brilliant sauce. Each bite is packed with that roux-y, tomatoe-y, spicy sauce and the chicken/sausage chunks in each bite are subtle and plentiful. The level of spice is manageable for anyone, in my opinion. Not over the top but definitely enough for you to recognize throughout the meal. There was so much of it, I had to take most of it home!  Prices are fair and the service was great. Next time, have to try the desserts!So happy with this quaint, festooned with Mardi Gras accoutrement, Cajun joint! Can't wait to go back!

Restaurant name  Diamond China 2

Review Text :
I was looking for a new Chinese place to check out near home and after passing on one because they did not have the dish I was in the mood for, I settled on Diamond China 2.  It was my first visit and I am impressed.  The place does not stand out physically by any means.  Not from the outside anyhow.  When you first walk in it does not seem any better.  The front counter looks like any Chinese take-out place.  Nothing special about it.  But I was quickly greeted and seated in a very friendly manner.  Service with a smile is a truism here.  The dining area is very clean and not in the least bit gimicky like some other Chinese places around town.  This is classy without being gaudy.  The blue floral print on the benches and seats if soothing and comfortable.  It also brightens up the room a bit.I began looking immediately to the noodle section of the menu.  I wanted chow fun noodles, my new favorite.  Before I found the dry style beef chow fun and decided on that, I was brought a pot of hot tea, a glass of ice water and a bowl of crispy fried noodles with sweet and sour.  It was like they read my mind.  Soon, the waitress came back to take my order.  She asked me if I ever had the dish before and told me a bit about it.  "Fun with bean sprouts and beef" and "True Hong Kong style" were how the dish was described to me.  I was also assured this was her favorite dish.  Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.  I sure liked it though.  The noodles were not as dried out and chewy as at some other places I have ordered chow fun from.  They were still tender but with that trademark chew of a rice noodle without being like rubber.  The beef was tender and delicious.  Maybe a bit sparse but honestly, with the bean sprouts and green onions mixed in with the noodles, the amount of beef was hardly disappointing.  I still came away full and floating away after a pot of tea and three glasses of water on top of my meal.  I'll be checking this place out again.  The food is good.  The service is excellent.  And the pricing is about average.I came across Diamond China 2 by accident. There were a couple of hours to use wisely ahead of my doctor's appointment at Advanced Foot &  Ankle Specialists near Mountain View Hospital. After the twenty mile drive from Henderson I was up for a Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. I was driving around the area when I decided to pull into the Lake Mead at Buffalo Smith's-anchored shopping center to see if there is a Chinese Restaurant. I was in luck when I  saw Diamond China 2.   Before stepping inside, I checked out their luncheon special menu hanging on the window. The luncheon special that is served Monday through Saturday from 11:00 am to 3 pm looked worthwhile. This menu separates the luncheon special into three price points ranging from $5.50 to $6.95. Corresponding to this review are pictures of the luncheon special and restaurant menus. The luncheon specials include a choice of white or fried rice, skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce, hot tea, and eggflower soup for dining in. The $5.95 price point includes two cheese puffs, and the $6.95 price point includes one piece of egg roll. In similar style to many of the Chinese restaurants, the highest price point includes the shrimp-based entrees.    Diamond China 2  is a rectangular shaped restaurant. The rectangle is divided into two rooms. Customers walk into the left room where the take out counter, cash register, and view of the kitchen are. Customers that are dining in proceed into the room on the right.   The dining experience was more casual than the take-out atmosphere in a Chinese Restaurant that would include New York Chinese or China Go Go. This is a full service restaurant. And good service at that. The waitress, hostess, and cashier, who's name I believe is Grace was exceedingly polite.    At the time of further reviewing my choices, there was a pot of hot tea with a cup and a bowl of skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce rested on the clean table. I have reviewed several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and never have I seen the waitress offer complimentary hot tea. The hot tea is delicious here. Too bad I have been unsuccessful finding the quality of hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve in a Starbuck's. But that is another review all together. I selected the chow mein soft noodles. They served it on a plate divided by fried rice to the left and the chow mein soft noodles to the right. It was delicious and in my opinion far better than the chow mein noodles served in China Go Go that are more filler than tasty. And those onions that were interspersed with the chow mein noodles added to the deliciousness of the entree. Between the crunchy noodles and the entree, I enjoyed a bowl (not a cup) of eggflower soup.    The best part of this lunch was that before a well-deserved tip, all this came to $5.95. That's a few dollars less than a fast food restaurant. The Diamond China 2 luncheon special was $5.95 well spent.

Review Text :
Are you the type of person who likes to explore new places? A true adventurer by definition?Have I got a hot one for you; 43rd Express, aka; 'Pho 43rd'.Owned by the same Vietnamese family for over twenty years, Pho 43rd, despite its dive-like ambiance both inside and out, is truly a charm.The pho is above average and served with all the accoutrements; bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, and jalapenos. Try the beef, tripe and tendon pho, asking them to conspicuously leave out the tendon and tripe. (I never said I was an adventurer, I only asked if you were) It's delicious.Their sauces are a delight, featuring a traditional siracha, their own chili paste, and a delicious homemade hoisin sauce. Spring rolls were light and wonderfully tasty. A strong recommend.The service is fast and very friendly.Upon leaving, the owner introduced himself and gave us a brief history of the restaurant:-How he and his brother worked in the kitchen since they were small children.-How the family has owned the restaurant for over twenty years, surviving the great recession. -How mom is now retired, passing on the family business to her sons. His story was impressive. One that makes anyone not familiar with the restaurant industry know just how difficult it is to succeed in this type of business, with all the hard work and sacrifice.Pho 43rd ceased to be a dive at that point, embodying the true spirit of capitalism and the American dream. I left, feeling both satiated, and proud of David (owner) and his family for what they've accomplished.If you're disinclined to visit a place like this based on its location and outward appearance, you'll be missing out. IMPORTANT NOTE: THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH.I hardly want to tell anyone, because I want to keep the place all to myself.WOW.Be adventurous. Try the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, or the salty plum soda.The soup bowls are gigantic. The egg rolls come with a platter of greens and dipping sauce. The prices are inexpensive and the service is great.At 2pm all the tables were full. That tells you something.UPDATE:Went the very next day with entire family. We each tried a different rice noodle soup. Everyone liked what they got, but we will note that meat is more of a garnish, so if you want more meat, you should order an extra order of it ont he side, which a lot of people do. But just know that at $6-9 (depending on what kind of soup you order), you are getting a lot of food that will fill you up, if you like a lot of fresh vegetables, noodles and broth. The broth is heavenly.On our way out we were followed out the front door to be given a rare treat: a macaroon ice cream sandwich, gratis. Now they probably don't make a habit of doing this, but we thought it was very generous, and it tasted out of this world!This is probably going to be a go-to lunch spot form now on!What took me so long to try 43rd Express?!  The staff was very attentive and explained to us that we didn't have to stick to the combos, but mix and match items if we wanted to.  I had heard about the macaron ice cream sandwiches so I was very eager to try one.  I ordered the red velvet macaron with chocolate chip ice cream in the middle.   It was so good!!  I recommend eating it right away before the ice cream starts to melt.  The texture is chewy and true to the flavors you choose.  A lot macarons these days are just sweet, but this place does it right!  The owner must have seen how excited I was because he gave my husband and I each regular macaron on the house!  I thoroughly enjoyed their customer service.  Since this was our first visit to 43rd Express, we were shown how to eat the dishes by pouring a special sauce over the meal.  My dish came with a fried egg, which was cooked the way I wish all eggs would be cooked.  You can see what I mean by some of the pictures posted on Yelp.  The fried eggs are crispy underneath and around the edges, and is just so perfect.  The entree I ordered came with a bowl of broth on the side.  The flavor rich and comforting.  43rd Express is now my go-to Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Five stars!!Pho is perfect for many things:as a meal, hangovers, cool weather and evoking feelings of nostalgia (IMO)43rd Express has it down pat. Throw your preconceived judgements and feelings of the exterior and interior appearance out the window. After dining here twice already, it's the kindness of their service and flavor of food that keeps me coming back for more- you already know that a good portion are their macarons as well!With the weather a bit cooler I decided to go with the Beef Ball and Rare Steak Pho and a Sam Bo Luong (sweet palm sugar drink with barley, seaweed, dried fruits and dessert beans). Unfortunately they were out of many drinks that day, so I finally settle with a Thai tea.Yes, yes, yes. Their pho broth is still consistent and lovely as always, aromatic, savory, salty and slightly sweet. Love how they provide a generous helping of basil and bean sprouts. Their rare steak is always tender and the beef balls- I must admit ... my biggest pet peeve is when Pho restaurants have beef balls with the little bits of fat studded throughout. These did not have that at all, yay! Always a large serving portion here that is inexpensive even for a college student like me.The girl helping us was so nice, to discount the meal since so many items were unavailable which was unnecessary but a great thought. She was also so kind and apologetic, but it was all so understandable.Free drink off the menu with a check- in on yelp.If there is a pho place you should try, it's this one!Definitely the best pho I've had in Arizona. Broth is flavorful and everything is very authentic. Pho tai ($6.50) is a good classic dish to order. My sister ordered the pho dac biet ($6.75) which includes steak and tripe (intestinal lining). We agreed that the pho here was really bomb and that we'd gladly return. The restaurant is kind of a hole-in-the-wall in a semi-sketchy area, but the food is well worth it.I also ordered 6 macarons because I was tempted by all the yelp pictures. They are $1.50 and larger than macarons sold at other places. They were delicious and very pretty to look at. I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and prices are very reasonable.TIP: Free drink with yelp check-in!I might have a macaron habit. But please, don't tell my addiction counselor.OMG so much amazing happens in the 43rd express kitchen. The saying "you don't know what you're missing" comes to mind when I think of everyone who's not had one of their a macaron ice cream sandwich.Never had the pleasure of experiencing Phoenix best macaron?, then get here, now. Unless that is, you've been here before, and if you've been here before and not had their macarons, I don't feel bad for you, I feel sorry. Sorry that you didn't order the best macaron you'll experience in Phoenix. With flavors like strawberry ice cream, taro ice cream, and Oreo cookie, the ice cream alone is delish, but they combine their home made ice cream with amazing macarons to form Ultron, defender of the universe. But seriously, it's a friggen macaron ice cream sandwich. It's rare that I head west for anything gastronomically delightful but this is just one of those places. If death must find me west of central phoenix, let it find me at 43rd express with a fistful of macarons and a mouth full of ice cream sandwich!! :-)Happy yelping!

Review Text :
First, a disclaimer: I grew up chasing the best dim sum in Atlanta with my comfort-food-starved-family, and I've tasted the dim sum delights of countless cities including Hong Kong. I understand that Charlotte, NC probably won't host the dim sum mecca we ABCs of the Carolinas are looking for.That being said, I'd have to say that Dragon Court hits the spot when traveling to Asia isn't on your agenda.Finding Dragon Court can be a little unsettling. As you're walking through the desolate shopping center courtyard, you'll see rows of abandoned shopping carts, an empty water garden, a stack or two of broken wooden pallets, and a coin operated merry-go-round. We almost didn't make it.Upon entering Dragon Court, however, you'll find that it's ambiance is pretty similar to many dim sum restaurants. One thing that's a little weird is that as soon as you sit down, pretty much every available food cart will flock to you. I guess since I've never been on a particularly busy day, the servers seek out customers specifically rather than just circling the restaurant waiting for you to flag them down.I've been to the other Dim Sum restaurant, and dish versus dish, I felt like Dragon Court wins out. My favorite dim sum staples are all pretty much there, too. My trusty dining partner said he'd be a little intimidated to go it alone without me, but that's the beauty of dim sum: there's so little commitment. Because it's just a series of tiny dishes, if you hate it, move on.Ultimately, Dragon Court satisfies my need for the occasional dim sum to break the monotony of Sunday brunches of eggs benedict and sweet and savory crepes (ooo actually those sound tasty at the moment...).11/13/10Don't ever come here!!  Should've known better than to stay and try the food,  after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server (the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal); It took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water.  Service was very slow (the noodles arrived first, and that was half an hour or more after we arrived); our server was surly, almost to the point of rudeness; and my nephew and I even checked out the aquarium there-- it was almost void of live fish (maybe one swimming), w/ dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water.  NASTY!  But (and there's always a "but" in these kinds of reviews, isn't there?) we were starving... Next time, I will insist on going somewhere else, especially when there are many signs telling us to!  (Funnily enough, the restroom here wasn't that bad...  I'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here, so the restrooms aren't used much?  LOL)Total bill was just under $50, w/ minimal tip.  Food included about six dim sum plates, a beef stir-fry, lo mein noodles, tea, and water.  The only item all of us liked here (Mom, sister, my nephew, and me) were the noodles!  The beef stir-fry was the only thing I thought was palatable, w/ some of the meat tougher than the others.  (Don't even get me started on the dim sum fillings!) I'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone!  I wouldn't be surprised to hear this place closing down very soon, if it isn't already. What a horrible experience.  :(

Review Text :
After hearing all of the Wing King hoopla and praise, it was destiny to stumble upon this fantastic joint at some point. We had played a round of disc golf down at Winthrop and were on our way back up I-77 and then *CLICK*. We were close to Wing King. The timing was perfect, the hunger was imminent, and wings were on the menu. On our way, we read a few other reviews and were a little iffy about dining in or taking out. We decided the full experience was necessary. We seated ourselves and grabbed our own menu and began to peruse the mountain of sauces available. Everything from teriyaki to crazy dry rubs. We settled on a large basket of fries with a side of medium sauce for my wife and 10 wings (5 Medium and 5 Honey Hot) for me. The fries are great. Krinkle cut with a subtle dusting of seasoning salt. The medium sauce....Textbook. It really does stick the the doctrine of "medium" and doesn't provide too much spiciness. Pungent flavor and well rounded with a buttery finish. The wings are evenly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and a good mix of flats and drums. I'm a big fan of the mixture as I feel flats tend to have more flavor and are more tender. The sauces work wonders on chicken. Goodness gracious. The medium will make any dyed in the wool wing-lover weak at the knees. The honey hot is something out of a romance novel. A sweet, succulent sauce that is thick like honey and has a slight twinge of heat. We even started dipping our fries in it! Usually 10 wings is too much for me, but I muscled through these bad boys with ease. I would have to say that Wing King lives up to the infamy. Wings that can turn my head and stay in my flavor memory are rare. I look forward to many visits to come!Our usual Tuesday get together usually involves wings and beer. Lately, it's been the Wing King in Fort Mill. This time, we decided to get past the fact that this WK is actually in a gas station plaza and give it a try.I opted for 15 honey hot BBQ boneless wings. A little drippy in the sauce department, but the chicken bits were cooked right, the sauce tasted great and they were piping hot.Good choice. Beer specials, or at least reasonably priced beer. Lots of stuff that's been fried. What's not to love?

Review Text :
If anyone had told me that I, a Jewish girl from Brooklyn and former hippie, would be living in Vegas and watchin a '30s-'40's swing show in the Italian-American Social Club, I'd think they'd just arrived on the first flight from Mars.  There's just no end to the Secrets of Sin City!How'd we get there?  An offering from LV House Seats.  It was definitely not my speed, but the description was intriguing.  And, they serve dinner (optional), so we figured we could kill two birds with one bocce ball.Aside from the fact that the average age of the audience was the wrong side of 75 (the saxophone player is 96 - and I am, to plagiarize Dave Barry, NOT making this up), the show was delightful. The reason for the offer was because the second part of the show was being taped for TV and will be seen on some local cable station - which one escapes me - in a few weeks.Jeanne Brei was the singer and star of the show, which runs the first Thursday of every month.   She's a pro - a woman of a certain age with a great voice and more energy than a 10-year-old.  The band is incredibly talented and date back to the very beginning of Vegas history - the sax player played with Benny Goodman, and all the other "youngsters" probably have a combined 200 years of experience.  She and the band are known as the Speakeasy Swingers.  Though listening to music such as "Pennies from Heaven" is definitely not my cup of Chianti, the show was very enjoyable.  There's also a large dance floor, populated mostly with a few professional dancers, but some regular couples got up to dance, too, though not the 95-year-old woman in the wheelchair who used to do solo flying.  The second part of the show, the one that'll be shown on TV, featured Jeanne, a talented tap dance duo, and solos by a couple of very good singers.But this is Yelp, so now to the food.  It was mostly terrific.  And no surprise - Italian!  I ordered Chicken Marsala.  I couldn't see the chicken, because it was buried under more mushrooms than I've ever seen on this dish - dark, woodsy, mushrooms in an authentic and rich Marsala sauce.  The same sauce, with even more mushrooms, covered the perfectly-cooked linguine served alongside it.  Hubby had Chicken Piccata, and it, too, was different - it was garnished with beautiful THINGS:  were they uncured olives? capers on steroids?  They're not my thing, so I couldn't tell, but my husband sure loved them.  Both entrees came with a small, unremarkable dinner salad in an unfortunate styrofoam bowl, and the bread, which should have been as wonderful as the food, was awful.  I think there's no cover for the show, and the fact that it was offered on LV House Seats was merely to ensure an audience for the taped portion.  Sometime during the evening a gentleman walked around with a basket collecting contributions "for the band."The large room is, no surprise, very dated - probably dates back to the Bugsy era, and there's a full bar in a completely separate room, with a juke box.This is surely worth a trip - for the entertainment, the food, and the nostalgia of a bygone era.  And you can even go for free Salsa lessons on the other Thursdays!!This is an old school restaurant and it's very good.  I came here for a show and had dinner in their restaurant section before moving to the room where they have entertainment and dancing.I was seated promptly and given a menu.  Someone quickly came for drink order and I soon had my iced tea.  After asking my server, Andrea, some questions about portion sizes, I went with a Caesar salad to start and veal marsala for my main course.  I was brought bread that was accompanied by three butters--one regular, one pesto flavored, and one olive flavored. My salad was quite large and it was very good.  Light on the dressing but heavy with the cheese and the cheese is done a different way.  The parmesan slices are baked in a bowl and broken and put in pieces under and throughout the salad.  This baking gives the cheese extra flavor and I really enjoyed the salad.The veal was very good.  The marsala sauce was rich and flavorful.  With the dish came a choice of side--either pasta or potato--and I took the daily pasta of ziti with marinara.  This was a good dish of pasta.I asked Andrea for her recommendation on dessert.  She to;d me her favorite was cannoli, but I have been disappointed by some restaurants in the past with cannoli so I went with her second choice--their house made tiramisu.  It was very good  with mascarpone, lady fingers, espresso and Belgian cocoa.  The espresso was not overpowering and the same for the cocoa.  It was a perfectly balanced, creamy, tasty ending to the meal.Service was excellent!  All the servers and bussers constantly circulated through the two rooms.  No table was just one person's.  Rather, they all looked out for each other and served the customers well.  This is somewhat why I call it old school.  The service and food are two reasons why the place has been around for over 50 years.

Restaurant name  Humberto's Mexican Food

Review Text :
Based on my first meal there I can only give 3 starts for now. My 3 star is rating the food, not the complex or the interior. I will explain. The complex has been there for 300 years, it was updated once about 150 years ago. There is a Pep Boys, Country Boys, Ghetto Boys (just kidding) there is a MEGA liquidator, a RC Hobby Store, a lawn mower place, a guitar place, car audio and maybe 3 other places. The complex is in dire need of cleaning, paint and general upkeep. Humbertos is a dive, the interior is sparse and ugly, The decorations are strange and old. The paint is gross, the floor is decent but the entire seating area needs rehab-ed. The KITCHEN is Immaculate, I am talking clean. The cook knows that that is his domain and likes it clean like his 67 Impala. The food was priced reasonably, I had carne asada quesidilla, Ryan had pork and chicken tacos. The food was good. Right on par with other bertos, nothing stood out as bad or as excellent. The service was friendly and the food arrived quickly. If I were in the area getting my car worked on or picking through the junk at the Mega store, I would go back. I doubt I would go out of my way to come here.

There is a difference between "cheap" and "inexpensive." Skyland is the "inexpensive" part with low cost meals that are good quality and good quantity. I love that they are open 24 hours and in this part of town, that's a good thing. Short walk - quarter mile - from the Woodlawn Lynx station as well.My daughter and I both opted for breakfast and were quickly served large portions and as much coffee as we could drink. My cheese and mushroom omelet had plenty of both. The hash browns were plentiful though you might want yours a little more well done.Two full meals for $20 with tip. Hard to go wrong there!

Review Text :
I'm a huge fan of most ***bertos type joints. I occasionally enjoy having lard drip down my chin after biting into a questionable beef taco...       NOT HERE. The oil very obviously hadn't been replaced in who knows how long. It was pure sickness. I am not a picky eater by any stretch. Growing up with little $ has it's perks in that way. Something has to have zero redeeming qualities for me to not just eat it anyway.I usually love fish tacos at places like this but these were fucking awful, not crispy, sauce tasted like straight mayo tacos from Hades.      blech!I won't return. I'm taking a long break from any ***bertos as well after this experience. My heart and cholesterol levels thank you Eribertos.I gotta say I like Eri's brother Fili much better. Or is it a sister. I'm not sure. While I devoured the carnitas tacos in my car at Filibertos, happily, with a smile and even a sense of danger...the goods I've had at Eribertos have left my mouth dry, unfulfilled and on one occasion, injured. Yes. I said injured. Keep reading. Rickie likes the Americana Burrito for breakfast...had it twice...both times too dry for me. No beans? I've eaten the carne asada and carnitas tacos...both just OK...I like my carnitas to be both succulent and crispy. Did I just say succulent? So I'm not always fulfilled...as I am with a carnitas tacos from Fiiberto's. AND then there was the time when I bit into some strange foreign object...and by foreign object I do not mean Aziz Ansari. Though biting into him might be mighty tasty. The drive thru guys are uber friendly. I wonder sometimes though, does anyone ever go inside? Fili. Eri. Whatev. Just glad when I need a fix I don't have to get outta my car! Buenos Nachos My Yelpitas!

Review Text :
We used to send a co-worker here to pick up lunch. We had them (especially Marissa) on speed dial. And I know they dread when I'm the one calling because I'm not Filipino enough for them. LOL. We call and ask what's on the menu since it changes every so often but we always get crispy pata. Their version is different from what you'll normally see in Filipino restaurants - appearance-wise. Theirs is super puffy. Crispy pata is one of my favorite Filipino dishes. Fried, crispy porky goodness...mmmm...  The dipping sauce is great (soy sauce + vinegar+ jalapeno + onions)...I just gave away the recipe! Great! I'm banned from this place now.CASH ONLY turo-turo (translation: turo = point). You point at the food you want and that's what they'll give you which is great if you're not super familiar with Filipino dishes. If you point with your lips, they'll love that! There are items such as crispy pata that's made to order.Other things that are good here are: halo-halo, turon and pork BBQ. They're pretty generous with the stuff they put in their halo-halo (leche flan, ube,  beans, etc). The turon (bananas and jackfruit wrapped in wonton-like wrapper, fried and drizzled with caramelized sugar) is sweet and crispy. Filipino BBQ is totally different from what Americans know as BBQ.  The Filipino BBQ is on a stick and is marinated in soy sauce, calamansi/lemon, sugar and sometimes ketchup. Yum!The first time I actually came here to eat, I was a bit shocked as to how small the place was but whatever. Pack it!Disclaimer Alert...This review is strictly for their service, Shanghai Lumpia, and Halo-Halo.  That being said, I found Baba's to be 4 stars in my book.  First of all, service here is great.  I didn't get the owners names, but they treated us like family. One of the owners reminded me of my mom and couldn't help do what us sons of a Filipino moms do, that's joke with them a little.  She was game and did the same. As for their food, we didn't get to try much because they were out of almost everything.  Baba's on our visit was catering 3 parties at the time.  With only one person cooking in the back, this meant they were out of Chicken BBQ, Turon, and Chicken Adobo to name a few. But they still had their Halo-Halo and Shanghai Lumpia, which are my favorite Flip dishes.  As a Halo-Halo Hunter, I found that Baba's had pretty much everything I look for in Halo-Halo (i.e. Ube ice cream, legit ube, flan, white beans, and nata de coco).  One thing that was missing was red bean.  It was still good and found Baba's Halo-Halo up there with the challengers around town. Note to self...bring some red bean to make it perfect.  As for their Shanghai Lumpia, I thought that they were as good as it gets.  No one makes them better than my Auntie Heidi, but Baba's is pretty damn close.  I'm not saying I'm a Lumpia Hunter, but I am a Lumpia Whisperer.  Whispers..if they make them, I will come.  Come to eat Shanghai Lumpia that is. Overall, I can see myself coming back.  This place is no secret.  Tons of regulars coming in and phoning in is proof that Baba's is some people's go-to Pinoy spot.  You don't have to be a Halo-Halo Hunter or even a Lumpia Whisperer to eat here. You just have to be a fan of Filipino food served by great business owners.TIP:  Call ahead or pick up their menu.  Some items are served on specific days.  Shanghia Lumpia is all the time!!YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (466/500)I ordered some catering dished for a pool party I had recently. Everyone loves some Filipino food, so I was excited to try out this joint. We ordered:SisigLumpiaPancit BihonChicken on stickEverything was super good. The only thing people didn't like as much was the pancit. I make it pretty often and they said that it didn't taste as fresh or as "fishy sauce" as they like it. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Especially because I didn't have to cook it! We didn't even have leftovers for about 15 people. We spent roughly $180 for the 4 dishes. Which is really not too bad. Overall, we'll definitely be going back to this place. I want to try out some more stuff to compare it to my family's cooking. :) Also, I need more sinigang in my life.

That's right, I'm giving this little greasy spoon 5 stars.  The food is everything you would require from a diner - tasty, hot, cheap.  I love the atmosphere!  Think Pulp Fiction - this place makes me feel like Vincent and Jules are in the booth behind me.  It adds a fun little element when you come in hungover/still drunk for breakfast.  The service is like you'd imagine it would be - a woman passes by every 3 minutes and calls you hun while she fills your coffee cup.We stopped in for breakfast before hitting the road back to Vegas.  Located off of Indian School Road, its easy to find with plenty of parking.The building itself is older and the decor on the inside reflected its age.  Upon entering we were greeted immediately.  We were able to choose any place to sit.  Our waitress was amazing.  She was so friendly with us during our visit.  I think she knew just about every customer that walked through the door.  Needless to say there were many regulars visiting for breakfast.  I ordered the Spinach & Feta egg white omelet.  Our waitress informed me there was also mushrooms, onions and tomatoes inside.  Sounds good to me!  I chose the hash browns for my side with sourdough toast.  The cook that morning was quite efficient.  Our breakfast was out in a flash.  The omelet was so tasty with the yummy ingredients.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly.  There was a lot of food sitting in front of me for $7.99.   My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy.  A huge portion for only $3.99.  Everything had low prices for an abundant amount of food. I would have no problems stopping back in for breakfast.

Review Text :
I've been going to Crazy Jim's for at least 12 years and it is one of my favorite spots for anything Feta. I have probably had every item on the menu throughout this 12 year relationship and have never had anything I did not like. Here are my top 5: 1. Gyro Feta Pita (loaded with gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and feta)2. Spring Mix Chicken Feta Salad (Enough to feed two people)3. Calamari Feta Salad (Crunchy and tasty) 4. Penelope Pizza (Chicken and Artichoke)5. Fresh Warm Pita Bread (a must have)The restaurant is cozy, casual, clean, and the staff is very friendly and prompt.  I have tried other Greek restaurants in Phx that have either been way to gimmicky or a total bust and none compare to Crazy Jim's. If anything ever happened to this place I would go "CRAZY"!!!!!!I finally made it back to Crazy Jim's... and just as I remembered, it was crazy delicious!I was taken to Crazy Jim's for the first time when I moved here several years ago... and I remember it being somewhere on the avenues downtown - obviously, I didn't know my way around the Valley yet.  Now I'll never forget where CJ's is located; it's easy - on 15th Ave just south of Indian School!Upon entering, it's easy to tell that CJ's has been around for a long time - it's comfortable, casual, and packed during lunchtime; filled with regulars I would assume.  (I'd be a regular if I lived or worked closer to the location.)I can only write about their salads and pita bread, but that's enough for me... the pita is pitalicious - I could eat the whole basket if I weren't so carb conscious.  It's sweet and savory and served warm and oh... so good!  The feta they use in the salads tastes like it's straight from the dairy farm; it melts in your mouth.  I have to explore the other menu options one day, and I have a feeling they won't disappoint.I definitely will not wait so long to return to Crazy Jim's!Gabi's review got me jonesing for CJs so I headed back over for lunch. Maybe it's a middle age thing, but I always forgot how good they are in between visits.Since I live close by, this is pretty much how CJs and I roll: 1) hit up website, 2) read entire menu 4 to 14 times, 3) pare down top 10 selections to 1 or 2 and call in order, 4) hop in car, and 5) return home 15 minutes later for a private pig out on the coffee table (so I have room to spread out). They do offer delivery, but it takes longer to get my feast on and I don't always need / want $15 of food.Since it's all pretty much been said, let me just tell you the few things that make CJs a stand out:* I have never found one thing on their menu that I wouldn't order again. * There is nothing that CJs feta doesn't make better... bring it!* I could eat my weight in their pitas and never tire of them.* The creamy greek dressing is 'lick your plate clean' to die for.* You will not find a better deal on baklava anywhere in the city (seriously it would be hard to get the ingredients for the price they charge).If you are eating in, grab a cold beer or some wine to wash down your meal (and they are working on upgrading their liquor license, so they will have mixed drinks soon).Don't let the location or the homey diner atmosphere fool you. This place serves up incredible food made from insanely fresh ingredients with flavors to match!Best pita bread IN THE VALLEY! I crave the pita bread enough to make me order a salad (a basket of it comes as a side with a salad) and their Ranch dressing is tasty (Hidden Valley packet tasty). My go-tos are: the goat cheese (with spring greens) or the gyro feta salad. Salads are around $10 but pretty filling.Non-pita lovers can get burgers or pizza :)I can't say I'm in the western avenues a lot, but in the future, whenever I make my way due west, I'll know where to get my Mediterranean fix! Crazy Jim's is hidden on 15th Avenue just south of Indian School. It's unassuming and you could easily drive right past it and never know the difference. But, take my advice and find time to stop in. You won't regret it. While in between meetings today, Gabi M introduced me to Crazy Jim's and I'm sure glad she did! We were seated by the friendly hostess in the narrow restaurant. Our drinks were brought out within minutes. We started with a side of hummus and pita bread and I opted for the Greek salad with chicken. I was told the dressing on the salad is excellent. The hummus came out in a bowl and the pita bread was fresh and warm. The hummus didn't have a ton of kick to it, but it still had the creamy hummus taste so it satisfied my chickpea craving. So here is where I shed some light on the concept of a salad from Crazy Jim's. Holy moly salad size! I think they gave me an entire chicken breast on the top of a salad of greens, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese and onions. The salad dressing came on the side and was creamy, delicious and definitely not low-cal (but I don't care)! The meal was hearty but not overly filling. I liked how the salad was hefty enough that I definitely didn't leave hungry for more. So in summary, there's nothing crazy about Jim's except the fact that they are crazy about their food and getting it right! The next time I find myself on 15th Avenue, I'll know where to go.

I've had take out here about 3 times now and it has always been good! I always call in before  I go so I don't have to wait and it's ready in about 10 minutes... The service is friendly especially the gentleman who I assume is either the manager or owner. You order the counter and there is both indoor and patio seating available. The prices are fair as well as the portions.. The dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) are addicting and have a delicious lemon taste to them! HOT TIP: If you like vinaigrette for your salad then request the lemon and oil dressing upon ordering.. If not, they usually give you a creamy sauce.. Also, they can toss the salad for you in the dressing and some special Mediterranean seasoning if you request it!I can never go back and I am bummed about it! MAJOR-LY.Here's the sad, sad tale: My husband and I had been frequenting Kabob Grille. Their lentil soup is homemade perfection, their vegetarian combo a delight, and their pistachio baklava is just amazing.So about a week ago, we were having dinner and a fight broke out between a Middle Eastern husband and wife. More accurately, a husband lost his temper and started yelling at his wife in front of their two young girls. When I say yelling, I mean unbelievably aggressive IN YOUR FACE, I'm-going-to-beat-you-up yelling. This continued for a few minutes inside the restaurant. Then, they took it outside. More yelling - hitting cars - more yelling - pushing. Meanwhile, the two little girls are sitting at the bar, teary-eyed. More yelling. What does the manager/owner do about this? NOTHING. He seemed to know the couple. He just stands outside watching as this man reviles his wife. Now, I don't know what caused the fight in the first place but there is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Can you imagine what happens behind closed doors?What should have been done:1) The owner/manager tells the couple that this is unacceptable in his establishment2) Ensure the two girls are OK3) Call the police when the husband starts hitting parked cars4) Apologize to customers and staff5) Offer a complimentary drink or dessert -  at leastNone of the above happened.

I've eaten here many times and had the Pizza, which I rate 4 Stars.  However, this most recent visit I decided to try the Thunderbird Sandwich $8.35 (Baked Chicken Breast, Ham, Pepperoni, Cheese) w/Lettuce, Tomato, Fries on the side for an extra $1.00.After a short wait, they brought out the food.  The Sandwich was piping hot....and looked so good!  I had to let it cool off for a minute because I didn't want to burn the hell out of my tongue.  It cooled off and I took a bite....WOW!  The combination of Baked Chicken, Ham, and Pepperoni was amazing!  The sharp flavor of the Pepporoni complimented the slightly salted Ham and perfectly baked Chicken Breast.  The Cheese and the Bread put it over the top!The Fries were pre-fab crinkle Fries and were nothing special....I'll pass on them next time.Overall, I was impressed by their Sandwich.  I already love their Pizza.  I would give them 4.5 Stars if I could.Will I return?  There are a bunch of other Sandwiches I want to try....hell yeah!Since Tenaya Creek Brewery doesn't serve food, we ordered delivery from Northside Nathan's, which is nearby.  After browsing the menu, we decided to get a Large 1/2 Guys & Dolls (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onions) & Veggetarian (Onions, Peppers, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives).....$24.  They told us 45 min to 1 hour.....not bad during the Super Bowl.The food didn't seem to take long to deliver.....we anxiously tore open the box and started to dive into it....it was very very good!  The crust is thick like Sicilian style Pizza and is fluffy and full of flavor.  The Pizza is square-cut and holds the toppings well on the crust.  It hit the spot!Easily one of my favorite Pizza & Sandwich joints in town.Return Factor - 100%

Have been back a couple times since last review.  I am tempted to up my rating to 5 stars.  Food is that good.  Maybe I'm going crazy but it seems like they might have raised their prices a little bit.  I feel like everything used to be $6 or $7 and now it's $8 or $9.Whatever, it's still totally worth it.  Same awesome waitress with awesome grill.  Prices may have gone up but food hasn't changed at all.4.5 starsI definitely would say try this place, but as for 5 stars, guess I'm a bit of a conservative Cubana. I am Cuban, and learned how to cook at the ripe age of 9, I will be 44 this July and it still is a passion. The passion of Cuban cooking comes from so many different aspects, first, the culture, the value of family, tradition, smells, flavors, colors, presentation and appreciation. One thing I have learned from cooking is if your heart is not in it, the flavor and the love in your food will be nonexistent! So....when I try Cuban food that is not mine or my families, I am a bit of a snob. But, this charming little hole in the wall, I felt the passion upon entering the place. The lady "Tati" who answered the phone and aided me with driving directions, was very welcoming, hospitable and anxious for us to sit and grub. I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacates (avocados, onions, vinegar and salt), tostones (crispy fried plantains), and the Boliche (Cuban-style pot roast stuffed with Spanish Chorizo), of course I have to order a Malta (malt beverage-ice cold). The appetizers were right on, perfect, the Boliche however, lacked the Spanish chorizo, the meat was tender tasty and presented well as were the accompanying black beans and white rice. But, honestly, my beans are better as is my black beans. I have often urged my sister to help me start a catering business or better yet, help me open a Cuban cafe, but in San Francisco, CA., I am not sure it would take off, people in California are much more partial to Mexican food. We did return the next day for lunch, my friend ordered the same thing she had the night before "Camarones Enchilados", which is sauteed prawns in tomato sauce, garlic, cumin, wine, onions and peppers served over white rice and black beans. She LOVED it so much and I was thinking the entire time, she would flip if she had mine! I ordered the steak sandwich and I was shocked when the sandwich arrived with lettuce and tomatoes??????????!!!!! Cuban sandwiches are forbidden to have lettuce and tomatoes...LOL! Anyways I removed it and had my sandwich, the meat was a little fatty, which is a No NO for Cuban sandwiches.....again we ordered tostones and avocado salad, this time the tostones must have been made by someone else they just weren't the same. But, it felt good to be around my own environment, my culture, my food and the staff here is excellent! They want to please and they want you to eat it all, which is very Cuban by the way, I give them a 4 stars, and I would go back, especially if I ever come to Vegas again, since I cannot cook while I am away from home, this is a life saver for someone craving some good Qooban food.Located on Las Vegas Blvd near Charleston. In the grungy area so usually do it in the day and it's not good for big parties as the dining room is really small.This is a follow up review and I Love this place. But I'm not over selling it and dont expect a fancy looking decor and designer napkins - it's not gonna happen. The waitress and t.v. are set for spanish...cuban style so be ready.Lunch pollo criollo , black beans, avacado salad and iron beer.  All we're bangin my drums and made it a better day :)Fast service  and like eating at a relatives and all really good.Been eating here for along time.

I know this phrase is overused on Yelp, but this place is a hidden gem!  If you're looking for a cute little place on the North Side to grab some casual, delicious diner-style breakfast or lunch eats, look no further!  CM and I stopped by yesterday at 12:30pm for lunch on the way to the Mattress Factory, since we didn't have cash, ruling out my first choice (Wilson's BBQ).  Despite being my second choice, this sweet little sandwich shoppe (love the old-timey spelling, BTW!) exceeded our expectations.Based on the recommendation of our waitress, I ordered the blueberry pancake special ($5.09), and a side order of home fries ($1.50).  My order came with three good-sized pancakes packed with delicious, juicy whole blueberries, topped with a ribbon of whipped cream.  The last time I received pancakes with this many blueberries was at Dutch Eating Place in RTM in Philly!  The pancakes themselves were of a nice consistency--not too thick or thin, or too light or heavy--just right.  My only wish was that there was more whipped cream--but then again, my waistline is thanking me for not flagging down the waitress to ask for more.  The home fries were cooked just right, with a hint of crispness on the outside, and were further enhanced by some additional salt/pepper seasoning and hot sauce.  CM ordered the chicken breast sandwich, Cajun style ($6.95), which was topped with lettuce and tomatoes, and came with a side of chips and a mayonnaise-y dipping sauce.  Because he was still feeling under the weather, I didn't sample it, but he was very pleased with it--although he did tell me it wasn't very spicy. (But then again, this is Bland-burgh...)Despite our arrival half an hour before closing, our waitress was convivial, assuring us that we could take our time eating and not rushing us out the door.  Based on their interactions with the employees, many of the other customers appeared to be regulars, which speaks well of this place's loyalty among the locals.  I only wish they were open past 1pm on Saturdays, since it would be nice to be able to feast on breakfast food and sandwiches later into the afternoon.  Our check came to $13.54--extremely reasonable, in light of the quality of the food received. Personally, I think this place is much better than Peppi's. 4.5 stars.

The food wasn't memorable, but the service was.Our waitress had no idea what she was talking about and seemed abrasive and rude!  Unfriendliness aside, she didn't even do her job very well.It's expensive, and just based on service alone, I wouldn't go back.

I just had one of those meals that I'll remember forever here.  Now I have to confess, it might have been much different had we gone alone -- but we went with some serious foodie Chinese friends who are regulars and wow -- we were seriously blown away.  Here's how my Chinese host puts it:  You know a Chinese place is good when it meets 3 criteria:  1)  The line outside the door is all Chinese.   2) The bathroom is dirty   3)  There are flies. We had a ten course tasting menu -- family style.  Started with a pot of pork and winter melon soup -- simple, light -- and as our host said -- free, so don't complain.  Who would?  Next came the "free chicken" -- all tables of 7 or more get the whole chicken -- that's Chinese poached chicken, served cold, hacked, bone in -- with a remarkable cold ginger sauce that I'm still thinking about.Then our server came out with our fish and lobster for our host to inspect -- and the reason he invited us to join him.  He wanted to teach my husband the difference in "fresh fish" and "live fish" -- there really aren't that many places in town -- or anywhere actually, that serve their fish from flipping, to flat in a matter of minutes.   And this was one of those mind-blowingly red rockfish -- that if you swam up to in the ocean, you'd definitely avoid.  The lobster was at least 5 pounds and gorgeous and pissed.   Soon, they would be our dinner -- and honestly I felt guilty and unworthy.Next, they brought out a platter of the most phenomenal looking prawns -- I'm talking 6 inches long, brilliant pink, heads and tails on -- for us to peel and eat, and dip into ponzu.   These were so fresh, I'm blown away -- packed with roe.  Truly a life changing dish for me.Then jellyfish -- with daikon and cucumber -- great acidity, sweetness, crunch -- and the slippery-ness of the jellyfish -- texture, flavor -- and we loved it.  Had thirds.Then there was tofu, that creamy, slippery kind that defy my Anglo chopstick skills.  Imagine, my horror and shame, when they presented me with a fork.   Yep, that bad.Then string beans -- the twice fried kind.  Shivers...they were so good.Oh, we did a quick check of the door -- we arrived at 7 -- and the line was  about 15 deep and super cranky that the two of us slipped past them (all clearly regulars) to our host and his wife and other guests who were already seated... we were the only white folk in the place -- and I don't think it went over well...   Now it wasn't even 8:30 and the line was still as long, and the room packed... I'm talking big parties, too. Back to the food...after that brief respite, they brought sauteed oysters and green onions,  stir fried rice with dried scallops and egg, the magnificent lobster, stirfried.  Then the rockfish -- Hong Kong style -- over more tofu, with more scallions and more ponzu -- nature's true art -- and a tribute to the chef that he served it so simply -- whole in all its beauty.Then, tada...crispy frog with jalapeno, fried garlic and green onions.   Yep -- frog -- apparently not such a rarity on menus in Vegas, as one would think.  Our host explained that frog is a big deal in China -- a very common ingredient -- rice paddies... I had never thought about that before.  His other guest also lauded frog's excellent medicinal benefits...since my husband is Alsatian, and frog is popular there, I guess I'm going to have to rethink things... it was definitely good enough to have again -- just for the batter it was in -- and yes, it tasted like chicken...The chef came out as dessert was served to visit with our host and meet my husband.  He is fascinating, the dessert, not so much...it was a red bean tapioca soupy sort of thing -- ok, it was the only miss for me -- but again, no complaints since it was complimentary... Seriously, for those of you looking for a truly authentic Chinese meal -- I implore you to try this restaurant -- now mind you, this was a simple Tuesday night -- and it was slammed.   This is a completely hidden, local Chinese only secret, which probably explains the reason there is only one mediocre review... and btw, the fish aren't in a tank by the door... But I truly believe that it would be best to begin asking your Chinese friends to come with you -- my guess is they're sworn to secrecy.  And I'll send you this wish, that your meal is as wonderful as ours was.Oh, and this place is open late -- I think 2am.  Try to come with friends in one car, too -- the parking lot is small, and in classic Spring Mt style, shared with a host of other businesses, but all are taken up by KJ Kitchen customers.  So there may be a wait for a parking spot, too.Here is the thing: I live in Austin Texas. You know what the best Chinese restaurant in Austin Texas is called? PF MFing Chang. Yeah... exactly. Therefore, when I leave Austin Texas I'm on a mission for Chinese food. Not beef and broccoli but REAL Chinese food. Therefore, when my buddy asked where I wanted to go my only answer was an authentic Chinese restaurant and KJ Kitchen was PERFECT. We ordered 4 items because...well.. I didn't know the next time I would be able to eat authentic Chinese food and quite frankly, I CAN put away enough food for 2 1/2 people. I'm not skeered. We ordered fried sea bass which was served with a dipping sauce that was not the slightest bit greasy and incredibly tasty. We also ordered sauteed Chinese broccoli which was as good as one would expect. I don't think you can really have spectacular Chinese broccoli. Whatever. Also we had a noodle dish and the steamed chicken both of which were VERY good. The service was very prompt and courteous and I never felt rushed. The owner also came over to say hello which was a nice touch. The atmosphere was as to be expected in an authentic Chinese restaurant: lobster tank, the usual art, nothing spectacular.. overall nice.Alright fellow gamblers, I think i've finally found one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. This hidden gem is about a mile or 2 west of Chinatown in a small shopping center. We started with the Egg Flower soup with crab meat. Yumalicious! I'm not a big vegetable guy, but I loved their garlic spinach. If you like tofu, order the clay pot cooked tofu. It's a great mix with your rice.  Now you gotta get the honey walnut shrimp because it was perfectly glazed and not overly mayo'd out. The walnuts tasted fresh and were well glazed too. For our meat dish, we got the sweet and sour pork which wasn't that great. I would probably order a beef or chicken dish next time. Finally, these last two items are what you MUST get here. The pan fried crab and the pan fried lobster. I loved the seasoning used in both dishes. You'll be sucking the poor critters shells dry. Don't forget about the egg in the crab shell!  Now for the warning. This place gets packed. The servers and waiters get your food out quick, but your wait will still be from 30 minutes to 1hr. The overall service was good, but they do get extremely busy so you'll have to waive them down a few times.  I suggest getting there a little early. They do open till 2am and they start serving hot pot after 10pm.  So after the casinos give you a nice butt pounding, head for KJ Kitchen for some healing.I have dined at KJ many times and have enjoyed their great food and reasonable prices. However, my last (and final) trip there was quite an unpleasant experience. We arrived at 7 PM and were seated pretty quickly within 10 minutes. Our server came by promptly and took our order of about 10 dishes, including appetizer soup and entrees. And then we waited.....I checked with the server on our order at 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, and 50 minutes. We were getting the "it's coming" and "they know" run-around answer. He even dared to say "it's the new computer system we have, you just have to wait." At over one hour since we ordered, I finally asked for the supervisor. She actually went to the kitchen (unlike the server) and had our rushed. At 8:15 PM, we finally received our appetizer. We were never given an explanation or even a simple apology. Unfortunately, the good food and cheap prices does not compensate for the horrible staff at this restaurant. I will never go to this restaurant again.This place is 100% a 5-Star place, however, only if you pass this quiz:Chinese food I eat most is:a. Chow Meinb. Fried Ricec. Lemon Chickend. Broccoli Beefe. All above but with brown ricef. Steamed Rock Cod with scallion, oil and soy sauce.If you picked "F", then read on below.  If you picked a-e, then this place will be a THREE-STAR for you and you are better off going to PF Chang, Pei Wei or Panda.For any of you picking "F", you will know this place is pretty darn good and well worth a 5 star.a.  The place - This place is a just the right size. Perhaps 10 -11 tables and also a separated area with two very large banquet tables. I can see this place would be busy at dinners and for lunch it was just right.b.  The service - I know I was in a real cantonese place because of the service. I would have to classify it as indifferent efficiency.  However, that being said, I wanted to order something not on the menu and worked with them and they had it and they asked me if it was the way I liked it. Also it was not too busy.c.  The FOOD -- You know you are in the right place when at the front door is a large fish tank with dozens of rock cod in the tank and also another tank with huge geoduck in it.  Yeah baby.  Let's get ready to rock it.- Rock Cod steamed - This s essentially a key fish in cantonese cuisine, at least in my book.  The rock cod themselves have rather large bones and is perfect to steam. The meat is just the right texture and when you add the scallion, oil and soy sauce, the smell, the taste, the natural sauce, it is absolutely the best.- Bitter Melon with spare ribs in black bean sauce - Now listen here all, you know you are in a great place if they serve bitter melon. How many people would normally order bitter melon.  If this was served at Panda, it would never be sold. but here, my goodness, it was great. The melon was just right, firm, not crunchy. The black bean sauce was just the right amount ant the ribs were cut to about an inch or so and was perfect!  When I first moved to LV, I could not find this at any Chinese restaurant so I learned how to make it and at KJ, I love it!- Steamed Chicken with Scallion and Ginger - Now I did not see this on their menu, and they had similar items that were fried, but I needed mine the authentic steamed method. I asked the waitress if they had this after I attempted to describe it and she knew exactly what I wanted and they brought it out.  The half chicken order was perfect. Tons of shredded scallion on top of the chicken that had a very thin layer of skin which means, awesome tasting proper chicken baby!  Yep, the best chicken for this is the not so thick and meaty chicken, but the bony rather emaciated chicken that have a wonderful taste. This dish was just perfect and I had to have extra ginger sauce as it was so good. d.  Overall - You know you are in a really authentic Cantonese restaurant when you see the following:- The Shovel Method - Yep, that is right.  You shovel the rice from a bowl into your mouth with chopsticks. You do NOT try to pick the rice up, you are NOT dainty, you are NOT polite.  You SHOVEL the morsels of rice into your mouth.  By the way, no soy sauce on the rice.  When you are eating Cantonese style, you are putting the food in your plate or your rice bowl and the fragrant and tasty juices of the dishes are absorbed by your rice. Much tastier than soy sauce.- The Boney Plates.  Yeah, not "china" plates but BONEY plates. Yep, true Cantonese people love their meats on the bone.  The bonier the better.  You will hear some sucking and some crunching, gnawing and jawing, however, the best visual is a plate piled with bones stripped clean like a piranha attacked it!- Oh yeah, no silverware.  Come on.  How can anyone eat Cantonese with a fork and knife is beyond me.  BTW, isn't it funny to see so many people at other restaurants eating Chinese food on an american style plate trying to use a chopstick?   I use silverware when eating in Chinese restaurants that do not have bowls.  Shovel method.  That is the way to go!GK says, check this place out. If you see someone making a ton of noise and gushing all over the bones on his plate.  Check him out. That could be ME!EXCEPTIONAL SOUTHERN STYLE CHINESE CUISINEThere are plenty of cheap eats in Las Vegas that serves great Chinese comfort  food. However for exceptional culinary excellence at most reasonable prices, there is KJ Kitchen which stands near or at the top. It's been years since my last visit and I had no idea of how popular this restaurant had become with it's LAS Asian residents as well as repeat visitors. The LAS Asian population now exceeds 10% of the two million residents in this valley. A mix of former California residents and overseas Chinese from all over the world.. It was a festive evening with people enjoying their southern style Chinese cuisine in this packed to capacity restaurant.. On this particular evening there was a table of ten red faced joyful diners singing all sorts of songs and ballads in Mandarin.Never had crossed my mind that on a weeknight there would be a wait list for a table for four. Worse for those needing seating of six or more. We were nearly finished with our six course affair when the group of six behind us during our wait finally sat down. The couple with us was essentially new to this level of excellence and style of Chinese cuisine. Perhaps one or two Gringo sweet and sour cornstarch dishes they may have experienced at a Panda Express or entrees served at many of LAS's culturally diverse buffets. Tonight we would introduce them to an epicurean experience and delightfulness that they never would have dreamed. In fact it was so enlightening that they asked for a takeout order of one particular entree to share with their family members waiting at home to hear about this evening's Chinese dinner adventure. I'll point out which entree (photo) they took home to share. I was surprised by the choice and so will you.Yu-go chauffeur's photos of this evening's dinner will more than fill in and complete this review. Oh, one more important item to mention, service was way above average under crazy busy conditions. They more than earned their 20% gratuity.

Review Text :
With the two restaurants closest to the Dodge Theatre not serving alcohol (you know who you are....bastards!),  finding Seamus McCaffrey's before the Margaret Cho show was like finding an EZ Bake Oven under the tree Christmas morning. Complete joy! I really don't know downtown so when we turned the corner and saw a bunch of smokers shwilling pints on the sidewalk, we ran like school girls chasing Zac Efron. Quickly and with our tongues out. We were thirsty and ready to catch a buzz before the show. Inside it was sort of narrow with a long bar on one side and scads of tables throughout. We spied an open table on the "patio" and were told we could nab that and our server would be right out. And she was. Delightful and speedy. We ordered two Stellas and a couple shots. Didn't see any food, but perused a pretty big menu. Usual fare with approachable prices. Thank you, though, Seamus, cuz the group on the "patio" was much more entertaining than Ms. Cho!We stopped here for dinner before catching the performance of HAIR at the Herberger Theater with Amanda B. and her sister. This pub / restaurant has a quaint laid back atmosphere and quite a few brews on tap Guinness, Bass , etc; I chose a pint of Smithwick's to accompany my dinner. The menu has traditional Irish fair like Corned Beef, Sheppard's Pie, as well as burgers, salads and sandwiches. I went the safe route and had a Swiss Cheese Mushroom burger which went well with the pint I ordered. I liked the fact that the burger was 1/3 pound and had a decent flavor. Seamus' has a great downtown location, half a block off the light rail. The majority of the menu is priced under $10 and quite an array of offerings so everyone should find something they like.I stopped in for a pint of cider on Friday night with some friends. This place is much less of a pub-in-a-box than some other Irish Pubs in the area and has some character to it. It wasn't packed, but was semi-filled with an interesting mix of people trying to get out for an after-work drink downtown. The wait staff was very attentive and it was a reasonable $5.50 for a pint of Stongbow cider. Seamus loses a star for having the worst bathrooms EVER! The god-awful stench as you ascend the stairs is enough to make your eyes water and pass out from holding your breath. It smells more like a sewer problem than the bathrooms themselves, but it was enough to make me think twice before bringing out-of-town guests here again.2nd stop off the rail pup crawl.. a little walk, nice place for regulars but they did not seem to like having a large excited group there. The server was good, the drinks were good and the price was good. The restroom stunk like old piss.As I walked into Seamus McCaffrey's, I felt like I was in a serious downtown. If I hadn't known better, I could have said I was in a Chicago or San Francisco. This bar was jumping with locals, live music bounced off the walls and character filled the room. The bar is divey, it's cozy, it's dark and it's awesome. The drinks are cheap, the patrons are awesome and there's plenty of seating. Downtown Phoenix could use about 15 more types of these bars. I visited Seam McCaffrey's after a Diamondbacks game and it was so cool to see Downtown Phoenix alive and bustling on a Friday night. This bar is like a little taste of what the entire Downtown Phoenix area could be like if we took every bar and restaurant filled with character like this and placed them on the same block. Having just got back from Chicago, this bar definitely reminded me of the character the Chicago bars have and it really made my night to see it! So bottoms up Seamus McCaffrey's! You make Phoenix proud!The Food? Only if you have to.The Bathroom?  Only if you have to.  So why the five stars?  Because it does what it's supposed to extremely well.  The second I walk in I hear "hey Dante" from the bartender as he pours me a Guinness.  Can you say that about a bar in town?  I can sit with friends on the patio and people watch.  You'll likely hear Bob Barker or see Cliff.  You'll notice the alley or like to call it "narnia" for the fact that no one who walks down it ever walks out as the same person.  You can sit on the patio of Seamus and judge the people at Ghost Lounge.  You see life walking around and can do it with a cigarette in one hand and beer in the other.Great little bar down town. They get oddly crazy busy just about every night of the week. I love living down town! Their kitchen stays open late, midnight I think, they have great beers and cocktails, its a scotch drinkers dream, I couldn't even count then number of single malts they had up there behind the bar. I dragged the boyfriend in a few months ago and he is in heaven!I love the down town feel for this whole in the wall-ish bar that has been around forever it seems. Might be fun to have a few drinks then wonder over to the San Carlos hotel and get spooked. haha :-)First off didn't stay here very long may be an hour or so, but seems legit. Cute college girls and full bar a plus, but a little run down. Appetizers (wings) were not very good. Drinks were on the soft side. Like the live band, and willing to give place another chance in the future

Review Text :
This place has been here for EVERRRR It's behind the Big O Tires in the same parking lot as a bunch of car shops. This was the original "Raider" bar of N. PHX. for over 10 years I guess its under new ownership now and the new owner ousted the Raider Club. Ouch this place used to be packed!! I haven't been here in awhile, well since I had a kegerator and with these bad times I found myself here again last night for a bit while the Fiesta Bowl was on. You would think with sports on that people would be here but the parking lot was pretty empty. It was about 8-ish and the bar was quite bare with only a handful of patrons sitting at the bar possibly just for the barbie bartender behind the counter in a tight corset. It was just my brother and I but we didnt get greeted upon entering or feel welcome so much. They only had Bud, Bud Light and Amber Bock on tap and what looked like a decent selection of bottled beer. The staff wasn't overly friendly or attentive to us with my brother practically having to beg to buy another round.The atmosphere was just pretty blah all around. The projection screen looks to be the same old one and is in dyer need of being replaced. The flat screens above the bar are nice but thats about it. One more good note looks like they put in a smoking patio that seems new and some fresh paint outside to green and white. Used to be Silver & Black I guess this place really wants to set itself apart from those crazy Raider fans. I didnt make it upstairs  to have a look around (they used to have pool tables) but most of the furniture looked to be the same nothing special or new. This used to be such a great place full of energy and happy people. We left feeling neglected and spent the rest of our money on scratcher tickets at the liquor store where they like us. I don't want to believe this bar is THAT bad so I plan on returning on a busier night, to give it another go and hopefully update with more stars??Was here on a slow night; they just began hosting free poker and just like karaoke nights, the purpose is to bring in people when they aren't already coming.The slow business worked well for playing poker, as the single bartender/server was able to handle everyone nicely and with friendliness.  The place itself is super cool.  Two stories tall, done all up in wood walls with old fashioned gas pumps and junk.  It used to be called "The Service Station" at one time, but i heard that no one could find it, nestled in a strip mall full of nothing but actual auto mechanic's shops, tire stores, and car stereo installation places.I can see Shenanigan's hopping on the right nights, and with atmosphere this cool, don't know why any of the local youngster alcoholic crowd would want to congregate at nearby Native New Yorker, Applebee's, Hooter's, or Santisi Bros.Sorry, Shenanigans.You're a classic example of unrealised potential.A lady on a pole can really screw up a brutha's judgement.Such supercools digs, and yet apparent satisfaction with such a generic standard.  The sportsbar goings on in this establishment are not worthy of the amazing architecture.This new disillusionment is based on my recent attempt to actually use the bar for its main purpose, to drink alcohol.  After a sad, quick glance at the beer tap pulls, the pyramid of empties on the back of the bar make it seem like there's a large selection of bottled, at least.But no, my hoppy friends, that is not the case.  I think the most imaginative thing there was Sam Adams Boston Lager.  They had Blue Moon, but I'm not a fan.  Think of every single other generic american beer and its Lite version, and it's there.  Why?!  Why have 6 or 7 different brands of american fermented rice lager, when the current trends in pub style have everyone and their mother drinking microbrew ales, stouts, and hefes? *also* - i understand cost and spillage, etc and how important that kind of thing can be to the owner's bottom line (esp employee theft), but I have never in my life seen a bar install special caps on all the bottles of liquor and an electronic device that fits over the bottle and measures an exact pour.  I get it.  but it's stupid....and... if as the bartender, you're going to make a comment that it's not your fault the owner makes you use such a thing, at least learn how to use the damn thing !!! If i'm only getting that one ounce then you'd better be sure squirting the liquor down onto your overfill of ice cubes doesn't splash my Captain all over the side instead of into the glass!!!  .and then you'd better not splash the soda in so full to the top that it spills over the side.  That's my ounce! I paid for it, and apparently I'm not getting anymore!!if you like generic beer and don't get mixed drinks, then this place can still be pretty cool.if i win a lotto, i'm buying the damn building and tying the owner to a wall for a month so s/he can see how a bar with this much potential _should_ be run.All the food offered sucks balls (except the heaping mound of french fries for like $2 that the cook fries up quite well), and the owner guy is a TOOL, the kind of jerk that thinks it's okay to banter in a talking-shit/put-down kind of manner with a complete stranger as if they were a long time friend.  Fake friendly doesn't cut it in the service industry.This is a tough one for me. I hate to review based off a short visit. Here goes.I messaged the new owners to see if they were serving real "coke" for a mixer yet because the last time I was there it tasted horrible. She said it was RC COLAOK cool. We hear they have Karaoke and decide Saturday 4-18-15 would be a good time to check it out. We arrived around 830pm. There was 3 guys at the bar and the bar tender. We both went right into the restrooms before sitting down. THE MENS ROOM IS FILTHY AND GROSS, NEEDS A CLEANING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND A GOOD COAT OF PAINT. I walk out just in time to see a tall slender black man (I only bring up race to assist in identifying) exit the WOMENS restroom, where my wife is, I was dumbfounded, I look around to see if she was in the bar and look to be sure she was in the right restroom. She came out with the same WTF look on her face. We exchange a few seconds of dialog while walking into the seating side... look at each other, and NOW that we should just leave. We walked out 4 min after being in there... laughing at the train wreck that just happened. I doubt we would go back, not until they get cleaning and get real mixers.

Goldent Nugget has a name that mashed together the names of two of the raunchiest pornographic magazines in mass publication, so I really expected very little from them. It was a surprising visit, though, with fresh food and a super low cost. It is sad to see the other review judging this place against the other "super buffets" nearby.  It's truly an apples to orange popsicles comparison.  If you want to go to the giant place with crab legs and junk for $12.99, go ahead. If you want the kind of buffet you got in 1981, this is the place to get it, for a 1981 style price, too. Does this menu sound familiar?fried chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, pork fried rice, egg rolls, beef&broccoli, sweet&sour chicken, jello, pineapple, hot tea, get the idea?The thing is, that even early sunday afternoon, this little old school hold-out was hopping with business when the other two giant buffets nearby were full of screaming kids and gluttons piling crab legs six inches high on their plates as if they don't know they're allowed to go back for more.Golden Nugget staying so busy means a lot.  There are many regular customers coming back.  The food rotates quickly and stays fresh.  Sure, the prompt, no-frills service from the host/cashier/server/owner/? guy borders on downright surly.  However you do not bother setting foot in a place that looks like this if you need 5 star service.The food was REALLY GOOD. There was a more authentic seeming dish made with chicken and spinach in a garlic sauce that was more super than anything in the super buffets multiple steam tables of repetitive dishes. I just wish I would have gotten the number of the doctor that advertises making house calls, posted on the wall here at Golden Nugget.  Not really a good sign to see this sign....but hey, I have a few bucks I saved since I didn't go to the super buffet.The people getting take out buffet reallly got their moeny's worth, too, since the lady dishing out the food REALLY piles in as much as she can fit.[cash only]

When you walk into La'Wan's there is a poster of a martini glass with a chicken leg in it. Now this makes me chuckle.  Our server was so friendly and always a step ahead of us.  He's the kind that if you have a restaurant you want to steal him away.  The food does not rock my soul, but it is served hot and plentiful.  And it's really nice  when we were leaving they all said good bye.  Very refreshing to have such a pleasant experience.  We get used to mediocre service and forget about what it's like to have proper hospitality.The menu is standard meat and two veggies, pintos, lima, collards, mac & cheese, potato salad, mashed potatoes.  Roll or cornbread.  Sweet tea. Ten dollar check average.Sometimes, you just want fried chicken. And you don't want to get it at the fast food joint. When that craving strikes you, give La'Wan's a shot.While the ordering situation was initially confusing... do I seat myself? do I order at the counter? ... it straightened out quickly. Yes, seat yourself. Yes, someone will bring a menu and take your drink order. There's also a buffet table, but I skipped that today.A few minutes later, I had a quarter of white meat chicken set down in front of me. The chicken was really excellent. Lots of meat, not a lot of batter, not too greasy at all. The mac & cheese lived up to the sign out front ("Best in the Queen City") with lots of cheesiness inside and a good topping of toasted cheese. Maybe not as good as *my* mac & cheese, but certainly some of the best that I've had away from my own kitchen. The cole slaw had the right consistency and texture, but I found the pickle relish taste to be overpowering. No worries, to each his own.Service was excellent. My water was refilled as needed, I was checked on as needed and there was a squeezy bottle of Texas Pete on the table for some bite.Really good chicken and great service. Yum!

Review Text :
I have to come to understand and accept that I am probably the reason restaurateurs  hate yelpers.I just have no appreciation for atmosphere. I know this because during my 12-day stay in the Bay area, the word had to be repeatedly hammered into my brain, as the natives could not understand how I could merely judge a restaurant's merit based solely on their cuisine. Eventually they wrote me off as a lost cause, chalking up my dis-appreciation of fine decor and tacky acoustic music as a symptom of being Phoenician. For a while I was confused. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Was I just impossible to please? Had I no taste for aesthetics? Oh shit, I have no aesthetic sensibility. I'm an art major. What does that mean for me?All I have is a clock radio. Who am I Mommy?I was beginning to have some serious doubts about my aptitude for critique. Sweet Zombie Jesus. Maybe I didn't know what I was talking about all this time.After all, Angie and Jimmie's is as far from atmosphere as you could be. Like, as far as John Cage is from actual music, or Miley Cyrus from being talented. Fun Fact: While in San Carlos we saw a guy parked underneath a Miley Cyrus billboard giving himself some of the old "self-service at the pump". True story.There are no polished tables and cushy chairs at A&J's. No, instead they have those all-plastic all-purpose chairs that last you years and years sitting in your backyard until you invite that one plus-sized friend of yours who sits in it and bends it in such a way that is is never usable again. And there is no ambient music. Only the sounds of the arcade machines and the TV, which no matter what time of day is always playing a crime drama. Or a Billy Mays infomercial. "HI BILLY MAYS HERE BUY SOME FUCKING OXI-CLEAN OR I'LL SHOVE SOME MIGHTY PUTTY UP YOUR ASS WHILE I BANG YOUR WIFE!"The staff at A&J care as much about presentation as Fred Phelps does about receiving a box set of "The L Word" for Christmas.Their wings are not soaked in the sauce (BBW calls the process "spinning") like at other joints. No, the wings are cooked, and then, the sauce is poured over them. At first you're like "this is fucking shady, I am not pleased with this", but when you can actually taste the chicken, and dont' have to ask for like fifty extra napkins, you find you might actually walk away from the table with some dignity. Try saying the same thing after paying 9 bucks for half a sandwich while ten pounds of bitch in a five pound bag asks you if you have room for dessert.The subs are meaty and quite sustaining. So I've heard. I have a rule about ordering shit that isn't on the sign. I've never ordered a cheeseburger at Del Taco or chicken nuggets at a Red Lobster, and here I am, still alive and kicking. The system works.The pizza is simply fucking fabulous. It's crispy but never crunchy, hot but never molten, and cheesy but never "hey, how long are you going to be on the toilet? I need to take a shower" cheesy. Honestly, the only pizza I've had in Phoenix that even compares to it is Pizza A Metro...which is another small independently owned pizza shop crammed next to a Circle K......Maybe it isn't me. Maybe it's just Phoenix. Or just the west side of it. Everything's backwards here. It's like Bizarro world.All the best food is located in these hole-in-the-walls, where the decor is haphazard the menus have to be laminated because people are always spilling shit on them. There's still a pretty good chance that I'm a tasteless Philistine, but we're  in Bizarro World and that makes me a learned connoisseur of wealth and taste. I fucking love it here.DING DING DING!!!! We have a winner!Yes, Phoenicians, you heard me right, I am hereby declaring a winner of the best wings in Phoenix even though I haven't been to all the restaurants that other people recommended.  There is no need. The best that another restaurant could do is come close to the yumminess available at Angie & Jimmie's, and I'm pretty sure that's not possible.  I've had plenty of adequate and good wings in P-town, but these wings are EXCELLENT!The wings are huge and meaty, covered in a mouth-watering Frank's RedHot-based sauce, and crispy.  Just the way they should be.  I haven't had wings this good since August, when I went to Duff's while I was visiting Buffalo.I have one teeny-tiny complaint though, A&J's sprinkles some seasoning on top of the hot wings that tastes like meat tenderizer.  I'll make a point of asking them not to put it on the wings next time.  It didn't make the wings bad, but it was a little distracting from everything else they did right.Other things I loved:- 5 pictures of Elvis in the dining room, 2 are on velvet- The counter is a 2x4 frame covered with lattice, the exposed lights from a beam, mismatched garden chairs, inch-thick layer of dirt on the windowsill - Just like in Buffalo!- The squeeze bottle of dressing that they give you with your wings, although I'm not sure if blue cheese is available.  I'll check next time.- The place reeks of yummy-smelling pizza. I didn't have any out of kindness to the gluten-sensitive husband, but I might have to go back and buy myself a small.- The menu is simple and perfect: pizza, wings and subs - Again, just like in Buffalo!Improvements that A&J's could make:- Kick out my neighbors and open up a second restaurant here that is only open to me.- Free food

Restaurant name  Blue Ox Tavern

Review Text :
It has been over three years since I last dropped in to Blue Ox Tavern.  And up until just a few seconds ago, I was still completely uninformed about the significance of "Blue Ox", except it has some connection to Minnesota.  So if you are curious about the name, here is a brief Cliff Notes notation about this trivia:Blue Ox is actually named Babe, and is Paul Bunyan's animal companion.Blue Ox was also a professional roller hockey team based in Minneapolis, MN, that used to played in the Roller Hockey International League.But if you are expecting the interior of the tavern/sports bar to be all blue, you will be disappointed.  Hues of light pink is what you will most likely be covered with regardless of where you decided to park your hiney for the duration of your visit. But don't worry, your eyes are very good at filter that out, but it could get problematic when you try to take pictures of your food, menu or other picture worthy subject matters.  Anyway, I was here recently to catch the slightly more than half of the most boring Super Bowl event in recent memory. The place was fairly busy, but there were still a few tables and booth that were unoccupied when I walked in.  The average age of the patron was easily over 35 (and I am lowballing my guestimate), so if you are looking for young wild and crazy sports bar scene, this is probably not your best bet.  Best surprise of the afternoon was the complimentary half time buffet that was sponsored by a local law firm (the hot links and other sausages and sides were a definite hit).Their regular menu is your typical, non-gourmet bar food.  You have your appetizers (mostly fried items and nachos), salads, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast items.  I had a bowl of soup (changes daily), and one of their burgers on both visits.  Food is decent and portion is relatively large (but nothing to rave about in our local weekly magazines), and most items are under $10.  Service is decent. The waitresses checks up on you regularly, so your refills or next order of beer is practically effortless.  If you stop in to this sports bar when there are no games on, you could save $1 with your Yelp Check-in off.Overall, I like this vintage sports bar that has persevered through the years with the occasional event promotions to draw in regulars and snag a few newbies.  Good experience if you are looking for something different from your regular routine.Review #5 of 2014Most dive bars have a stench of stale smoke, barely-passable food, and sucky service. Based on my visits, Blue Ox must not be a dive bar because none of those things can be found here! Space is a bit dated but clean, and staff is downright peppy. Food is low-priced and fresh. COBB SALAD: Generous portions of all ingredients, wish the dressing were served in a cup and made in-house rather than takeout packets.* But having the calorie count handy does make me use less.ALL BEEF JALAPENO CHILI: Ask to add sour cream, onions, and cheese to make this meaty dish into a meal. Good flavor without being spicy. This would be even better if they had some sort of cornbread.FISH & CHIPS: Two smallish pieces of fresh-fried fish, crispy and flavorful. Fries are crinkle-cut but also surprisingly good. House-made tartar sauce is just right, malt vinegar available too (in a packet again).They have a few specials, like walleye on Fridays and ribs on Saturdays. Ask about their Mules Around the World drinks. Back of dining area has a separate meeting space available to reserve. Staff is always cheerful, music is a good mix of 90s alternative and radio hits.*I stand corrected, the ranch dressing here is made in-house. All other options are currently served in packets.

Restaurant name  Shiloh Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
CM and I had dinner at the Shiloh Grill on the 4th of July after we found that another local restaurant (that shall remain unnamed) that took our reservation was closed for the holiday.  Given that I had a City Dining Card for Shiloh, after confirming that they were open, we headed over to grab a table.  Although all of the tables on the porch were occupied, several tables inside were available, so we were able to be seated right away.Despite being seated right away, nobody came to take our drink orders until almost 10 min. later, after I made eye contact with a manager.  The waitress who took our drink orders offered the excuse that our waiter had to cover some tables both upstairs and downstairs, which is why he hadn't stopped by yet.  After 5 more minutes, he finally showed up with drinks redundant with the ones that'd already been delivered by someone else.  At that point, we were ready to order, so he took our food order.  Thankfully, the food came out reasonably quickly after that, but we weren't super pleased with the service, given the initial snafu.Because we visited on the 4th of July, there was a special limited menu, but I was pleased to see that the prices appeared to be unchanged from the norm.  First, CM and I ordered a large mac and cheese to share ($12), which was brought out prior to the entrees per our request.  Despite looking rather dry on the top, the mac and cheese didn't disappoint, and was up to the standards of the mac and cheese we'd received from the Harris Grill in Shadyside.  For my entree, I ordered the Henny Penny spicy chicken sandwich ($9.99), and CM ordered the 4th of July blue plate special ($7.76), which came with two hot dogs, tater tots, and a slice of watermelon, and also got chili sauce on the hot dogs (+ $1).  The sauce on the Henny Penny sandwich was spicier than I expected, but placing the vegetables served on the plate on it helped dampen the heat a bit.  To be honest, the sandwich wasn't my favorite, but I know it's a popular menu item here, so if you enjoy really spicy food, you may like it more than I did.  CM's hot dogs were pretty standard, but the chili was a nice touch, dressing them up a bit.  Our respective sides were mediocre, being of the previously frozen variety, and my fries were disconcertingly limp.  CM also tried to take advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free bowl of chili (worth $3.75), but after ordering it, we found out that we couldn't combine it with the City Dining Card discount (according to the fine print, this is the case--however, at least one other restaurant has let us double dip on discounts, so YMMV, I guess).While I felt that the price: food ratio was decent here (total check: $24 after discount), unlike our last experience at Harris Grill, I also felt that our meal here was pretty forgettable, aside from the lackluster service.  (Our waiter even forget the doggie bag we requested for our leftovers.)  Everything about Shiloh Grill, from the menu to the setting to the service, was almost identical to its sister restaurant, the Harris Grill, so your opinion about Harris will transfer to Shiloh pretty well, and vice versa.  As such, my rating would be a by-the-book 3.5 stars (reflecting the PGH citywide average), but the inept service we received merits a decrease to 3.0.

Review Text :
Unique, fresh and damn good. Unique, they are called Steakenburger, they combine a good burger with a good cheese steak. Nuff said Fresh, The bun...oh the buns. Fresh local bakery, sliced when ordered, light and spongy. I am a bun kinda guy. Damn good, The two slices of cheese, the two thin patties and the cheese steak fixins, all wrapped in "the bun" The beef was fresh, Thin but fresh, not frozen. Served with skin on huge steak frys.... damn good. I too wanted a second burger, but opted for 31 flavor for dessert instead.Open letter to restaurant customers everywhere (especially Yelpers):The inc.com article recently discussed in Yelp Talk makes good points about the serious impact that Yelp can have on a business, positive or negative.http://www.yelp.com/topic/tempe-new-article-on-yelphttp://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fmagazine%2F20100201%2Fyouve-been-yelped.htmlDespite any controversy the article also may have included, I realize the importance of being a responsible reviewer more after reading it, and hope I can share that feeling and understanding with you now.Especially when it comes to independent, unique, one-of-a-kind places -- would you really want your favorite local flavor to disappear because a yelper or two didn't like a particular server's muffintop or tone of voice?With that in mind, I must humbly take on a review Update that 's weighed heavily on my soul for some time.Several months after my initial review of Steakenburger, I received a note from the owner, Tom.  He sent a personal message instead of a public comment, and did NOT at all make the mistake some proprietors do by responding in an angry or condescending tone to my critiques.  Instead I found the response to be brimming with *CLASS*.I received a sincere and heartfelt letter apologizing for my experience and asking a chance for redemption.  If you read below, you can see that they took the review and steps to address its criticisms VERY SERIOUSLY.I would like to invite all Yelpers to remember to give second chances and update their reviews often, even the bad ones, whenever appropriate to do so.  Sometimes things go wrong that are outside of the biz's control.Sometimes a rogue server is having a pissy day and takes it out on you.Sometimes they just make a mistake.We all do.  And we always want another chance, don't we?  Ask us and we'll tell you we DESERVE it, too.   -----------------------------------------------------------------"Ryan C-My name is Tom Philp, owner of SteakenBurger.First, I am bummed about your bad experience.  With that said, I truly appreciate your candid feedback.  I cringe every time I re-read your experience (which is often), but I believe your review has made us a better restaurant.While we are still hiring from the human race, and will make mistakes, I'd like to believe that we listen to our critics and respond with systemic adjustments to prevent future similar occurrences.I have waited some time to respond to insure that I felt comfortable that we had improved our processes and consistency.  I'd like to invite you back for a do-over ....I've read all of your reviews and know that I could get skewered again if we fail you, but also feel that we would get a favorable review IF (and only IF) it is warranted.  At the risk of your wrath, I invite you back. Thank you for your consideration of this invitation.Tom & Judie PhilpSteakenBurger"---------------------------------------------------The folks at Steakenburger are a class act, and I wish them great luck in their tough business endeavors.Steakenburger earned their redemption, and they highly DESERVE it! I went back for the food, becasue it is unique and fresh and tasty.  The Steakenburger was a delicious meat-pile, cooked to ideal doneness, and yet still juicy without feeling greasy.  The homecut fries seem to be double fried now, or something, becasue they had a crisp outside while retaining a potatoey mushiness inside -- perfectly cut thick with the skins on.  Homecut fries are hard to crisp up, and they've done a wonderful job with this recipe.  There are ten different flavors of wings (let's see if I can remember them: mild, med, hot, suicide, zombie (?!?), bbq, honey bbq, honey hot, habanero, damn i fell short!) and there is even a neat challenge to eat a certain number of habanero wings within an hour and get your picture on the wall of fame.  I'm sure Adam Richman has this one on his radar allready for a future MvF.  Steakenburger is way more deserving than some of the junk that's been on DDD, too (Chino Bandido, blech)In summary: GO TO STEAKENBURGER !Good cheese steak + good cheeseburger=SteakenBurger What else could we hope to see? Good sushi + good pancakes=SushiCakes Good Thai food + good omelet=ThOmelet Good Schwarma + good BBQ=SchwarBQGood doughnuts + good custard=DoughTurdI can see we wouldn't want to go too far with this concept but it's working for SteakenBurger.I could have sworn I wrote a review of this place months ago. Are some of my reviews disappearing? The Yelp can't just give my reviews away because I have so many! So SteakenBurger is a pretty solid sandwich place with big portions. Consider sharing a sandwich and fries here, you can always go back for more. If they were closer to home I would go back. Ryan C's review brought me in when I was in the neighborhood. The atmosphere is pretty basic, service was friendly and the food was pretty good and reasonable.Heard about this place on one of my favorite morning talk radio shows and decided to give them a shout out. Been here a few times in the past when in the area and hungry for some grub.This is your basic Burgers, Wings, Cheesesteaks, Pizza, and deep fried vittles joint. They even offer a few items that go coco crazy spicy. One is called the Diego Dave's Habanero Wingz Challenge. If you can finish 10 wingz in under 10 minutes you will get a free T shirt and your photo on the wall.We have tried the Zombie Wingz, the HellzaPOPPIN Double Cheese Burger, a couple of the Steaken Philly Sandwiches and a few of the different deep fried Appetizers. We both thought the food was pretty good but not outstanding. Kinda like a Dairy Q on steroids and then some.Service is friendly and helpful. Give them visit and go SPICY if you dare. I could just buy their Spicy Habanero Hot Sauce and put it on some Ice Cream. Might even rub a little on my sore knee. OH YEAH!3.5 STARS

Review Text :
So there I was on Yelp! Looking for a Thai lunch buffet in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, none of the reviews I read had a lunch buffet. After searching through the 11 or 12 Thai Restaurant reviews in Las Vegas I stumbled on the picture of Lao Thai Kitchen [It reads "Lunch Buffet" under its name].The lunch buffet starts on Monday - Saturday from 11:00AM - 2:00PM.Pro's:1) All of the food was very fresh (even though we arrived at 1:35PM the food was still very good).2) Plenty of Available seating. Of course, this could be because we arrived at 1:35PM...3) Five or six servers means fast service.4) Several Thai dishes to choose from including soups and desert.5) Servers were very friendlyCon's1) I recommend arriving for the lunch buffet anytime before 1:30PM because, by the time we arrived, the servers were basically done serving. However, we still received drinks.2) The distance from the strip or downtown Las Vegas to Lao Thai Kitchen keeps this spot a local secret.So now your probably wondering why I gave Lao Thai Kitchen 5 stars. When I eat a buffet I am basically eating for quantity and not quality, here the quality far surpasses the quantity. Give it a try, I definitely recommend the lunch buffet at Lao Thai Kitchen.

Restaurant name  Grandview Saloon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I joined Yelp specifically to say this: The Grandview Saloon was one of the worst culinary experiences of my life.  I would rather lick the grease off the tracks of the Duquesne Incline next door than suffer through another meal here again.The entire Grandview concept appears to be premised on the belief that as long as you've got a phenomenal view, you can charge inflated prices for food you'd be offended to find in a middle school cafeteria. In general, the food I saw was all-American in the worst possible sense - bland, slimy, and whenever possible, smothered with cheese.In our case, the chicken marsala recipe eschewed the traditional topping for some kind of watery combination of ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The shrimp scampi tasted as if it was prepared by a chef without a tongue. Our request for pita chips that were simply warm, not fried, elicited a significant delay from the kitchen, as if they couldn't figure out why any of their customers wouldn't want to slurp up something lathered in butter and oil.Frankly, we should have run out the door the moment we sat down.  My brother-in-law aptly described the decor as a Days Inn ballroom circa 1995.  The walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them.  Of course, you've got an incredible view of the downtown skyline, but that's no excuse for such hideous decorative malfeasance.  After all, Vincent van Gogh didn't frame Starry Night in particle board he pulled from a dumpster.If you've got even one iota of romantic feeling left after surveying what must surely be an accurate replica of Purgatory, the Top 40 hits from five year ago blaring over the soundtrack will surely kill the mood once and for all.  While you enjoy the strains of Pink's "Get the Party Started," you'll be left munching on beer-battered blobs, silently wondering why your life feels so empty and numb.To think that I paid almost $70 here for a two-person dinner that didn't even include alcohol makes me want to gnaw off my own pinkie with rage.  That experience would be tastier, cheaper, and far more pleasant than my time at Grandview.  However, my sacrifice will only achieve some higher meaning if I can serve as a warning to the rest of humanity.  For a great night out, check out the free view from the public observation point a few doors down, and then eat in literally any other restaurant in Pittsburgh.

Restaurant name  Lenny's Burger Shop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Whenever I think of Lenny's Burger, I think of that urban myth about ecstasy. You know the one."If you have sex on ecstasy, you'll never be able to enjoy it sober."  Why, because the experience is that intense, or because you're brain has been so fried that you can't realize you've spent the last twenty minutes trying to fondle a rock? And why the fuck are you dropping this on me now? Like I'm not stressed out enough worrying about how a ouija board works and whether or not Mountain Dew depletes your sperm count. Shut up, you.Lenny's Burger is the ecstasy of hamburger joints.You go in there not expecting much. Perhaps even a little condescending because you're so fucking spoiled you don't know any better."Ha! Look at this ironically low-end establishment! Why, they don't even have a value menu! Bush league! Oh, how cute. They expect you to pump your own condiments. What, couldn't afford the little packets? Ha. This shall be a good laugh."And then you order, I don't know, for argument's sake, a double-patty chili burger. And fries. And let's just say that, for shits and giggles, you fill your drink cup up with horchata, because it's my fucking scenario.You bring your order back to your table. Ha. How quaint. Burgers served in a noisy steamy cafeteria setting. How retro. One minute you're biting into a slab of meat in between some bread.And the next you're in fucking Willy Wonka land.Your taste buds suddenly become Charlie and Veruca and Augustus.HOLY SHIT THIS BEEF TASTES LIKE IT CAME FROM A REAL ANIMAL! AND THIS CHILI'S FRESH! THE BUN IS TOASTED! JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST, THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING FRIES EVER! I'VE NEVER HAD BURGER JOINT FRIES THIS GOOD! AND THIS HORCHATA FUCKING ROCKS! IT TASTES JUST LIKE I IMAGINE HORCHATA WOULD TASTE!And believe me, muchachos, if there were snozberries on that burger, they would taste like snozberries.By the time you've finished your burger, you already crave one again.You spend the next few weeks trying to convince your friends to try it with you."Dude, you have to try this burger place. They have the most amazing fuck me burgers ever! Seriously.""Nah, man. I'm good."WHAT!? Bitch, you did not just turn down a suggestion from an Elite!Weeks later, you find that nobody wants to try this place.Because they're all trying to get clean.They're trying to cut back on the fast food. Get on a good diet, go vegan, cut out the refined sugars and carbs or whatever the fuck it is that people with a nutrition book do.It's not you. They're not turning YOU down.They just know. They know because they've seen it happen.One Lenny's Burger and suddenly they're lives will go out of control all over again.One bite of a double-patty country burger with cheese and chili fries and suddenly they'll start double-dipping and eating right before they go to bed, and years from now they'll be wearing those electronic belts that zap the fat off of you while they get their cry on to a very special episode of Maury Povich.It's just you and Lenny's now. You'll do your best to be stoic about it. Eating alone while tables of laughing hipsters and married couples enjoy their hearty meal, stopping to give you the occasional look as they slowly decide in their minds what could possibly be so wrong with you as to force you to eat your meals alone."Just come with me once. I'll pay for it.""No thanks. I'd rather do McDonald's.""WHAT!? Didn't you watch Super Size Me?""Actually, I just did. Now I want a Big Mac.""Fine...just this once."Go on, buddy. Try and enjoy that, what do they call it, a Large N' Delicious? A Royale With Cheese? Yeah, I'm sure you like it going in, let's see how you like it coming back out.Your stomach/intestines aren't fooled. It wants the good shit. It's not going to settle for this "McBullshit" you're trying to feed it.Just deal with it. You've been bought and paid for by Lenny's Burger Shop. You are Bitch Numero Uno.Awww, don't cry. Ronald McLittleKid'sNightmare didn't like you anyway. But Lenny's Burger, Lenny's will always love you. It will always be there for you. It will never judge you, and will even forgive this little "selling out" phase you went through. It's okay. We all make mistakes.Now...would you like cheese with that?Hopefully today you have learned something, and understand the downward spiral that is consumption of actual food.Be good, stay in school, listen to your parents, and remember, what doesn't give you high blood pressure and diabetes will only make you stronger.being from LA.. i didn't know where to get a good burger and chili cheese fries so i yelped chili cheese fries and 2 Wienerschnitzels topped the list.. and i thought.. wow.. it's gonna suck being out in AZ.. then i look further down the list and see 5 star review for lenny's burgers.and the words chili cheese fries. i didn't even read the review at all until i got back from my own experience. but jetta's review is awesome!let me say that in the midst of all the commercial chain burger joints.. we found a diamond in the rough.looks like any random burger stand but when i saw the nacho cheese dispenser.. i just prayed that the cheese they used on the chili cheese fries... i watched as they prepared my food the fries sizzling in the oil and then drenched in the real chili not that runny ground meat crap.. but has kidney beans and a bite like real chili should and then she drizzles the nacho cheese and tops it with jalapenos.. oh and the kicker.. when i grabbed a fry and chomped it down.. i realized.. they even used seasoned salt on the fries before they chili'd it. i was so pleased with the chili cheese fries i nearly missed the burger patties..they are HUGE. and i just got a single on sourdough i believe it's a 1/4 lb of meat. and real meat. i think it would have been better to have the pattie thicker rather than so thin but it was still good.they have different sauces on different burgers and a wide variety of shakes.i couldn't finish my burger which i also added bacon too and they load it up with bacon. i had about 1/3 of the pattie left and it was still bigger than a big mac pattie.. maybe even both patties put together.the establishment itself is sort of weird. it's quite narrow and there is counter space but they also have tables around the corner but it's setup in a very weird preschool like environment and it's super quiet.. almost freakishly quiet.. and i believe the restrooms are through the back door.oh and there's a HUGE sign that says they don't accept checks.. just to warn everyone but who pays for a burger with a check?It's lunch time here in the LBC, and I want a big juicy burger like the ones I used to have at Lenny's!! The only *other* thing I miss about Phx.. What a gem of a find!! Hands down, the best little burger shack I've ever been to.. ever. And we stopped there completely on accident. The smell lured us in maybe lolDon't come here looking for decor (there really is none..).. just stand in line, place your order, and wait for the good stuff to grace you with it's presence :) I remember people comparing Lenny's to In n Out and Sonic. How embarrassing! I love InO but you just can't compare the 2.. or 3. Sonic isn't even in the same league, sorry Sonic lovers of the valley. ANYWAY, if you're in the 'hood, this is a MUST. BIGGER and better than In N Out and all that other stuff for sure. Drip down your hand, cheesy, beefy mouthfuls of bliss. And the fries..mmm... geez I'm hungry now!I think your either a fan of Lenny's or not a fan.  I can't seem to understand what the "fans" are tasting when they eat at this place.  I went to this Lenny's again last week for lunch and and had there single cheese burger with a side of fries and drink.  The burger was overcooked and tasted like something you would get a burger stand on a street corner. The toppings were ok but my bun was smooshed since it was on the bottom of the bag.  The fries were plain, possibly pre-frozen.  I tried their Mexican burger on my prior visit based on some Yelp reviews and it wasn't much better than last week's burger.  Bottom line, I'm not a fan yet but it's beats going to the chain fast food places since there is not many places to go in this area.BTW ~ I find it very hard to believe the burger in the cover photo was taken at Lenny's... there's no way.

Originally I used to like this location because it was convenient for lunch purposes.  Today I've had the worst experience out of all the restaurants I've eaten at.  A few weeks ago I was eating at this location and I took a photo of an employee texting on her phone and posted it to Yelp which you possibly can still view.  Harmless photo....Well today after I ate my lunch I was getting  ready to leave and I was approached by an employee that works here.  As he approached me he had a phone in his hand and he had my yelp profile pulled up and asked if that was me. I stated yes but I thought it was a little weird that he'd have my profile on his phone.  This employee states that his management wanted me to take a photo down that I posted a few weeks ago and that it was against the law for me to post a picture of an employee without their consent to yelp.  This same employee then stated that the mother of the employee I snapped a photo of worked there and that the employee was UNDER AGE.  I then asked him if she was under age what is she doing working there?  He really didn't have a reply for that.  I asked this employee to show me where it's against  the law to take photos and post them to yelp.  He then got a little irate.  It just amazed me that instead of serving the customers he's going through his phone and pulling up yelp reviews and confronting customers with them.  One minute he is stating that management wants me to take the photo off and then the next minute he's telling me I'm breaking the law and that Carl's Jr has lawyers and they could sue me.  At this point I was tired of listening to his nonsense and asked him to get out of my face.  Then this employee had the nerve to tell me to get out of HIS store.  All this over a photo!  At this point this employee starts yelling for his manager across the store with other customers in the store.  This same employee has horrible customer service.  Several weeks before this incident today I ordered a simple low carb burger and went to sit down.  I watched 3 other customers come in and order and receive their food before me.  So I went to ask for a refund.  At first he say he couldn't do a refund and that I would have to come back for a refund because a manager was there. I demanded a refund because I waited around 15 minutes and watched other get their food.  So then  he's telling me I have to sign a receipt saying I got a refund. I declined to sign the receipt.  I didn't sign anything when I paid for the food.  I was a little upset because my food was sitting under the warmer the whole time and he just either refused to bring it out or was just overlooked it.  Ever since then he  has had a chip on his shoulder.  One thing I do not like about situations like this is that when you say your going to make a complaint to corporate or their district manager....he responds with his first and last name like he's bullet proof or untouchable. This employee thinks it's okay to confront customers in the store and demand them to alter their reviews or photos.....then states it's managers request and then wrongly quotes the law.  I  think managers are smart enough to realize not to mention anything positive or negative involving reviews especially since it's a fast food chain.   I feel this is a case of an employee just thinking he can say or do whatever he wants involving customers.

Review Text :
It's rather difficult to find, hidden in the back of an otherwise boring office plaza. They clearly do not get much walk-by traffic here. It's also a little out of place in a city like Charlotte, where barbecue and Bojangles fried chicken usually rule the roost.Katz is a standard New York-style Jewish deli (though not kosher), decorated with assorted New York memorabilia including the front page of the Post celebrating the Mets/Yankees World Series and pictures of the World Trade Center. If they're trying to show their New York creds, they've succeeded.Depending on the server's mood, they'll put a bowl of cole slaw and some pickles on the table when you're seated. Katz serves the usual stuff you'd expect for such a restaurant - corned beef, pastrami, etc. What's not to be beat are the "Smokey Joe" - whitefish and nova on a bagel (get an everything bagel, of course!) and the classic Reuben sandwich. Doctor Brown's sodas available too. The chicken soup is just as good as what mom makes.If they have any left, take some rugelach to go! (They do not accept AmEx.)All the New York memorabilia this place has around the store is really easy on my eyes. (read: Yankee transplant) What is not easy on my eyes is the faux paint job that covers the walls.I think I've been more impressed by all the articles with rave reviews  they have lingering in the store front window then the sandwiches I have ordered form here.The Reuben (pastrami) was good !  but for the price ($10.50)  I would have expected great. ( the title reads "Charlotte's best Reuben"on the menu.)The portion was nice and they serve it opened face unless you ask otherwise. For the price it does not even come with fries. They do give you complimentary pickles and cole slaw. The cole slaw has no flavor at all IMO.I have sampled a few others sandwiches from the menu but this place is know for the pastrami and Reuben's? Oh and the knish,which I have also had the round potato one. If you like cheesecake order it here! It is $6.00 ($5.95) per slice but  I can easily get two slices from it and I'm a pig.Their black and whites are shipped in from NY and not bad if these are your thing .I think even the best black and white in the whole wide world might not impress me. So, if you like B/W cookies try em here for yourself.The people here have always been cool unlike the  time Peter L visited the store.Go back,Try em out Peter L , Let us know!I've been wanting to review Katz for a while, I mean I've eaten here for years and years.  I've gotten to know Lee and his fun crew.  They know about our shop, they were the first restaurant to see our new son a week fresh--back when he'd sleep in his stroller heh.So Katz, why are you wanting to go here?  I'll tell you.  They open early, for a breakfast that is hearty.  Want an omelet? Expect a full platter.  Our favorite is the 2-2-2, eggs, pancakes, bacon--inexpensive and hearty. They have some of the areas best hash browns which are more the potato chunky crunchy seasoned style.After morning you're always served some pickles and slaw.  A nice primer for a meal.  I don't know the history but I enjoy it.For lunch I have 2 go-to's.  The Philly with a side of mayo, or a half-reuben (whole if I'm ridiculously ravenous else it's waay too much.), add a basket of fries and we're good to go.  The reuben is open faced style with your choice of corned beef or pastrami styles--you can go 1/2 and 1/2 too.  Piled high with kraut, sauce and cheese. The philly on the other hand is on a crispy toasted roll loaded with brisket, mushrooms, onions and cheese.  Really tasty and hearty.My wife Robin many times will get a 1 potato 2 potato which is like  plate of meat and mash with applesauce.  She loves it, and I don't argue.Their bagel/knish platters are par for the course and I believe they now source fully from Poppy's Bagels which gets a lot of local kudos from me.Now for the finisher.. If that wasn't enough get their blintz as a dessert.. You'll get stapled to the couch for a while.  Luckily a secret is you can order a 1/2 order of them (1 blintz) and it's the perfect side.  Sided with sour cream and blueberries.The only thing I as a hearty foodie of natural product origin would like to see is-- when fruits are in season, I wish Lee would buy them.  Fresh blueberries, strawberries or peaches  with the blintz would be killer.  The other thing is we bring our own maple syrup (grade B baby!) because they have those old school corn-syrup-flavored-maple things and for the style of their breakfast it just doesn't do their product justice.  It's all probably a cost but it's points that could take it higher.They are like family and will get to know you over time so say hi for me when you're in! :DSo, since my last review in August, I have returned twice and definitely owe them a better rating. After today, I felt they deserved a four. I arrived and was seated immediately and received the complimentary pickle and cole slaw, chilled to perfection this time, I ate it all. I ordered the Turkey BLT, with Swiss on a Kaiser Roll. The sandwich was huge! And delicious! The turkey was sliced to my liking, the bacon crisp and the added touch of mayo on a fresh Kaiser Roll, OMG! I could only eat half so I took the other half to my Mom, who is from New York, and she loved it. The wait staff is great, but definitely favors the regulars, so maybe I will be one soon. I look forward to returning and definitely checking out their breakfast options & bagels sandwiches, because from what I saw they looked awesome.Finally getting around to updating one of my first dozen reviews that I wrote six years ago, it's time to repeat everything I said. Dropping the "Katz" from the name to disassociate themselves from the original Katz Deli in New York, this is now just "New York Deli". Yes, they have every right to the name as the previous owner was Katz, but this just eliminates any confusion.This is a proper New York deli with sandwiches that are more meat than bread which includes pastrami and corned beef, knishes, potato pancakes, smoked salmon and whitefish, the usual black & white cookies and of course, rugaleh pastries. There's nothing else like this in the Queen City.Depending on mood, I might have their smoked fish platter or their Reuben. The Reuben is a ton of food and has won "Best of Charlotte" a couple of times. But today, it was the "Smokey Joe" which is a toasted everything bagel, cream cheese onions, tomato and whitefish salad with a solid portion of hand-sliced Nova salmon. A great portion of very fresh food.The New York Deli isn't easy to find and it looks closed when you drive up to it. But they're open, buried in the very back of the plaza at the southeast corner of Providence and Pineville-Matthews.

Review Text :
This is the exact same food from the exact same people who brought us the fine 7foot tall, tube sock and sneaker wearing, weiner squirting ketchup onto himself at Mr Gyros  http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-gyros-glendale#hrid:vNtdB1l_gwBMZ4slKfrGBQThey're both solid 3.5 stars, serving Chicago style dogs, falafel and gyros, italian beef, and other assorted fast food.   Mr Gyros gets 3 and so BurgerMania gets a 4, maybe for nostalgia at eating at this building in its previous incarnation as a Wendy's all through high school.I've only had the gyros and fries, both really good, with HUGE portions.I trust DarenC though, who has tried it all, and liked it all but the burgers -- but with the Pastrami-Burger getting a special mention, I had to put it on my list for next time.   (Ironic, with the name, but these guys aren't really specializing in burgers, making the alternate name "GyroMania" suggested by the previous yelper a great idea)Friendly owner or his son will chat you up if you like;  I found the matriarch of the family who served me at Mr Gyros a bit more reserved, but still cordial.  They also run the Mr Gyros II up in Anthem.So nevermind the Bell Rd car-dealerships, Motel6, Waffle House, and other nearby neighbors (the lady with the short skirt doesn't really want to 'date' you) and pop into BurgerMania for a little of everything.Disappointed I hear only good thing about Burger Mania and thought it's about time I try this place.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the food on this visit wasn't  good.The burgers at Burger Mania are exceptionally bland.  To be honest initially, when I unwrapped my burger and took the first bite I thought there wasn't a patty on the bun. When I pulled the top of the bun off I saw a very small thin patty covered in condimemts.  The burger had so many condiments it made the bun soggy and it fell apart.  The fries at Burger Mania were crispy and hot however, the fries had an odd tasting seasoning and just weren't very good.On a positive note the service at Burger Mania is fast and the prices are on the low end.  However, if you are looking for a tasty traditional  burger or would like to enjoy a burger  with a twist, I would forgo Burger Mania.

Review Text :
Big Wong just gave me a food-gasm!Being Wong virgins, Hubby and I decided to get the Family Style Dinner so we could try a wide variety of menu items. The waitress/owner warned us it was a lot of food, and she did not lie. We started with a bowl of delicious egg drop soup which was quite eggy and also chock full of sliced veggies. Next came the po-po platter with flavorful and perfectly cooked tempura shrimp, beef stick (cooked to medium, very tender and tasty), pork ribs so tasty my "I don't eat things with bones" Hubby sucked it clean, yummy veggie egg rolls, and the best crab rangoons I have had in a long time. Already getting full, the entrees came next and they were so good we had to have some of each. We ordered the stir-fried scallops which came with plenty of fresh and crunchy veggies in a light garlic sauce, and the house lo-mein which was full of shrimp and pork and chicken. The noodles were perfectly cooked and flavorful. It all came with a heaping side of fried rice which seemed to have as much pork pieces, egg, shrimp, and veggies as rice. It was a ridiculous amount of food and we have more than enough left over for dinner tomorrow. It really struck me that the meat was of a higher quality than at almost any other Chinese restaurant I have been to in the Valley, and they also know how to prepare and cook seafood properly- a Phoenix rarity. Having read online that they make their own ice cream, Hubby and I simply had to try it. They have two flavors: coconut with chopped peanuts on top and a bright green one that gets some flavor from coconut, but the rest of the flavor and its color from a Chinese leaf that the owner says they use a lot in making desserts. Both were absolutely delicious. A little more icy than the super-premium double-churned ice creams most of us are used to, but I thought it was really light and refreshing.But- the owner gave us some potentially bad news. They are having some lease renewal disagreements, and may close by the end of the year, and may or may not open at another location. Go, go, go to Big Wong and experience this culinary treasure before it's too late. Hours are 11:00-2:30 M-F and 5:00-10:00 every night for dinner.

Poor customer service in Spanish AND English. You just can't legislate or regulate against stupidity. It is hard to manage a franchise operation, I know. But with unemployment hovering at ten percent, I think this Popeye's can do better.The chicken I'm not interested in fueling a brand loyalty debate. It is what it is. Spitefully overpriced, but each to his own as I prefer the flavor of the spicy. But bad customer service in today's economy is UNFORGIVABLE. I'm not talking about someone who can't speak in a language I understand (because they didn't realize it ... but I speak all languages spoken at this particular Popeye's) and I'm not talking about someone having a bad day at the register. I'm talking about shameful, rude, arrogance beyond comparison.No...I will never go back to this ghetto excuse for a Popeye's.  This chain restaurant franchise has earned my "Restaurant Most Deserving of Implosion" award for this year. There is no excuse for the racism displayed by these people, and no excuse for the clowning around behind the counter in view of the customers whom you attach nicknames to. Evil, evil people.Grr.

Review Text :
Wow, how is it possible for a Cajun place to have so little flavor? Everything here was completely bland, uninspired, and barely resembled the amazing food that comes out of New Orleans. I've seriously had better Lean Cuisines than what we ordered. It probably didn't help that we came a few days before Christmas, originally planning to eat at Revolution Pizza across the street, but having to settle on Boudreaux's because Revolution was closed for the holidays. As soon as we walked in you could feel the nasty cigarette smoke in the air (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385694117/in/set-72157623503537096/), I definitely do not miss that about North Carolina restaurants.After waiting well over 10 minutes, someone finally came by our table to bring us some water, but they didn't take our order. We waited another 10 minutes to at least see a waiter, and I finally got impatient, went over the bar, and asked who the hell we could give our order to because we had stuff to do besides sit around in an empty restaurant. Apparently there was some confusion over who was supposed to take our table, and instead of figuring out which of them should do it they though the best course of action was to ignore us completely, not smart.Since we were already delayed a good bit due to the slow service, I decided to only get one appetizer for the table, the gator bites. I really love the flavor and texture of gator when cooked properly, and my mom or Nicole had never had it before, so I wanted them to try it as well. The pieces we got were pretty miniscule (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385694465/in/set-72157623503537096/), and the plate as a whole wasn't much in size or appearance. They basically charge you for novelty, and then make it as generic as possible. In fact, the pieces were so small, some bites wound up being more breading than meat, really sad. The cajun "mayeaux" was also far too creamy, and too much mayo and not enough cajun.I ordered the shrimp and crawfish etouffe as my main lunch item, as I generally love anything cooked in a good roux. This was another tragic failure. The shrimp were not cooked properly, and the crawfish was virtually missing. The roux was a sloppy mess (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386459240/in/set-72157623503537096/), and even the cornbread was doughy instead of crumbly. Worst of all, there was NO flavor, it tasted so horribly bland. Etouffee is supposed to be one of the crown jewels of Creole cuisine and they butchered it.My mom ordered the blackened chicken salad, which sadly was probably the best thing at the table, but unfortunately it too was still lacking any solid flavors. How you manage to cook something "blackened" and leave it devoid of any charred or spicy flavors is beyond me, but it looked like they just rubbed some red pepper on and prepared it normally. I didn't even bother trying Nicole's oyster po'boy, because the baguette was completely ruined (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385695997/in/set-72157623503537096/). The bread was practically crunching off like charcoal with each bite she took, and the oysters themselves were tiny and fried for entirely too long. The fries were edible, but overcooked as well, and probably sitting for a while because they weren't very warm.How much of this horrible meal was due to it being Christmas week and them probably understaffed and under-enthused about having to work I'm not really sure, and I honestly don't care. If you're going to be open you should treat every day the same, and give customers the same quality of service you normally would, otherwise give everyone a 50% discount for your 50% effort.Date night with Mrs. K., we headed to NoDa of course!On a Saturday night, there was a solid wait for a table - 45 minutes. We spent it wandering the nearby neighborhood and were only accosted by one "upper class" beggar who wanted "a dollar toward a vegetarian burrito, man". Love NoDa!We started with the "Gator Bites" - a small plate of battered and fried alligator tail. Despite living in South Florida for a decade, I've somehow managed to miss out on this delicacy. Tender and rather buttery, you should give it a try.For our mains, I chose the day's special - a half-rack of St. Louis Ribs which came with an ear of corn and cole slaw and fries. I cleaned the plate. I love ribs and these were particularly fall-off-the-bone. My date chose the blackened steak, which she said was cooked perfectly and the side greens were excellent.I would have thought that after a meal like this we would have been stuffed solid, but our lovely waitress managed to convince us to share a bread pudding and cappuccino.Great meal, great service, great date. We will absolutely be back!Okay - confession #1) the waitress from Davidson Street Public House said if you're going there next, order the Red Beans and Rice with Andouille Sausage. Confession #2) we peeked in and there was no one in Boudreaux's at the time - it was bright, empty and I didn't want to feel like I was on display in a fishbowl, so we ordered and had the food delivered to Sanctuary. Holy Yapple Dapple Yabba Freakin' Doo! Tasted like they have been stewing/cooking those beans all day long - jam packed with flavor and spices. Nice consistency to the rice (not overcooked). Let's not forget the sausage - nice portion with just a little heat. Great choice of eats for a pub crawl or foodie crawl. If I remember correctly too, it was under ten bucks. Will definitely be back to try the Jambalaya that Kelly C raved about!Boudreaux's Louisiana Kitchen was the first place my coworker and I went to in Charlotte.  Mostly because I was craving Shrimp and Grits!  It's been a while since I had some Southern food.  Overall, based on the dish, pretty good.

I could have sworn I had a review for this place! Since I have no idea where it went, I guess write a new one.I really love this place. Welcoming, great service and lots of good food make this place one of my favorite Italian eateries. They have lots of lunch specials and reasonable prices, as well as a dinner menu that won't break the bank. Their desserts, deli counter and breads are always fresh and plentiful, so it's a good place to pick up food to go.I'm not a big pasta eater, but they cook their pasta well and all the dishes I have had here have been delicious. Some of my favorites are the linguini with clams, eggplant parm sandwich and many of their lunch and dinner specials are outstanding as well.I prefer the other location but can't put my finger on why. Service is quick, product is good, the sandwiches and salads are what I prefer to get. Space also includes a small deli, bakery, and grocery area, with cannoli, San Marzano tomatoes, and various meats and cheeses. They do offer takeout and delivery, and dine-in does include table service for dinner.Their chicken or eggplant parm sandwiches are heavenly, with fresh bread, tons of gooey cheese, and a large portion. The calamari salad is a bit plain, but fresh, so I tend to go for the greek- add chicken if this is intended as a meal.Downside to this location is the parking situation- I often come by to a full lot and have to pull out on the busy street, turn into another adjacent lot, repark, and walk over. If you want a great sandwich though, it's worth the (admittedly minimal) hassle.

Review Text :
The ultimate panacea for a hangover:-THC-H2O-Burritos from El Norteno. Sunday I awoke with a headache that could reduce a lesser man to renouncing alcohol. Rather than do something so drastic and foolish, I opted to meander wearily down 7th ave to El Norteno. Riding my bike there in the already intolerable morning sunshine I fantasized about what I would order; savoury green chile pork, creamy pollo fundido, succulent machaca beef, mountains of delicious beans, gooey melted cheese, gallons of horchata. My goal was to be the fat and happy mexican version of Augustus Gloop, drowning myself in beans rice and horchata, while small guatemalan oompa loompas admonished me in song. Thick in the midst of daydream I nearly rode my bike into oncoming traffic on 7th ave. A wandering homeless man gave me a look that suggested "what the hell is this guys problem?", I shrugged my shoulders and waited at the cross walk. Staring expectantly at my destination, mouth agape, drooling, raving and mumbling, unaware of my surroundings, tortillas and tacos and tostadas danced around my head like little hallucinatory mariachis. The homeless guy I saw earlier managed to catch up to me at the cross walk, and again he stared dumbfounded, with the same look. I paid him no heed, I was so close to my goal, if only the light would turn!! Finally the punishment light turned and I rode across, once there, I realized there was no where I could safely lock my bike up, and in this area, I'd either lock it up, or end up walking home. I walked it a little up the street and found sound rod iron gates I could hook the u-lock around. I start walking back and I see the same homeless dude go inside ahead of me, I cursed my luck and followed him into the cramped little closet of an area inside where you place your order. The homeless guy,....lets call him Thurston, was third in line behind two portly Hispanic guys, assumedly father and son. I sat and sat cramped behind the three ahead of me. Thurston finally got his chance to place an order and opted for two! mexican pizza's. Again I cursed my luck, knowing how long it would take to actually get my food. After Thurston placed his order he stepped outside into the glaring sunshine. I got up, rubbed my hands together rapidly, and stepped up to the counter. I chose the pollo fundido plate and a carne asada cheese crisp with horchata, and after waiting eagerly my number was finally called. I grabbed my order, headed to the little eating area, and promplty blacked out, apparently over dosing on mexican food.

Review Text :
I still remember going to Esmeralda's as a little girl. My mothers boyfriend at the time was Salvadorian so we would frequent it a lot back in the late nineties, early two thousands. Not a lot has changed since then. I still come from time to time, sometimes I call in an order and pick it up for lunch. I don't work too far so it's a cheap, convenient meal. The pupusas are really good and a steal at $1.50 each, although I do prefer the revueltas versus the other filling options they offer, they come with a red salsa and curtido (chopped cabbage in vinegar). The platanos fritos con crema y frijol are also really good, I love dipping the plantains in the beans, it's mix of sweetness and saltiness that I can tolerate without being grossed out. To wash your meal down, I recommend an ensalada. It's a homemade fruit drink with little chunks of apple. I've never had a problem with service, there is normally a sweet older lady that hands me my order, other times, a younger woman replaces her, let's just say she's not the friendliest, she's very cold in comparison, doesn't smile, and just seems miserable, but she is never rude.

***L'Etoile is a very good contemporary fine dining restaurant, but it is also a great showcase of Midwestern farms, Wisconsin cheese and grass fed beef***More than any restaurant I have tried in the Midwest, L'Etoile is truly committed to local, seasonal cuisine.  The back of the menu lists the many local farms that L'Etoile uses to produce its contemporary fine dining cuisine and the freshness and quality really come across.  A lot of their produce burst with flavor and freshness that is easy to find in California but difficult to find elsewhere.In addition to the fresh ingredients, L'Etoile utilizes a lot of premium ingredients like chanterelles, high quality prosciutto, buttery and velvety foie gras, and grass fed, dry aged beef. The kitchen also shows great versatility whether it is a fresh and vibrant salad like their tomato, cantaloupe, arugula, and prosciutto salad, an intense and refined fine dining dish like their foie gras with sweet corn, chanterelles and blueberry gastrique or a hearty Midwestern dish like their New York Strip with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and bearnaise.I enjoyed all the savory courses I had.  Their cantaloupe in their starter salad had a great sweetness and the aftertaste of that fruit was mellowed out.  In addition, the dish was one of the menu items utilizing Asian ingredients (the head chef Tory Miller has an Asian heritage).  The cantaloupe was marinated like kimchi to provided a nice spiciness.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#1Dm_XzeFUsGbh-7ea6UYpwThe seared foie gras was very good--buttery and creamy on the inside and a slightly crispy exterior.  All of the garnishes stood out--earthy chanterelles, very sweet summer corn and a sweet and tart blueberry gastrique.  I think the dish could have benefitted from brioche, a crumble or a streusel because of the creaminess of the dish.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#kZci-HIMA6X0QDqBEI8hxwThey do beef very well here.  They source from a farm that dry ages their beef. L'Etoile then performs additional dry aging.  With dry aging, you can make the meat more flavorful but which can sacrifice juiciness.  That was not the case here.  Despite being a New York Strip and being dry aged, the meat was very tender and juicy.The meat also had a really strong beef flavor, which you do not always get (even with good beef).  The outside crust was also good--slightly crisp and very flavorful.  The side of mashed potatoes was also very good--rich and very thick (like good French pomme purée).  The other sides (like overcooked shiitake mushrooms) were very ordinary--the kind of food you would get at a run of the mill steakhouse.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#X9QeW2cMEXDG8iUldS1h1QFor cheeses, they feature 30 varieties of cheese from Wisconsin.  I did not love the cow's milk cheese I had, but it was more because it was not my kind of cheese.  I like softer and creamier cheeses.  The cheese did have a complex flavor--nutty like gouda but also with salty Parmesan notes.  The garnishes were great--really flavorful and crisp walnut toast, spicy hazelnuts and a really good fruit paste of cherries and berries.For dessert, I had their warm polenta cake with blueberry compote.  The cake was good as was the blueberry topping.  The garnishes did not work though.  I liked the caramel corn but the regular corn (not treated in any way to produce a different texture) just did not work as a dessert. The sour cream and blueberry sorbet was icy and tart.  And given that the polenta cake was not incredibly sweet or rich, I think a good ice cream would have been the better way to go.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#VYKnzdgfn2KDV7hMZcgsgQService was excellent.  My server Jessica was very personable, polite and polished.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu, which made me very confident on what I was ordering.  Despite the many courses, the food came out at a very even pace.Prices are high at L'Etoile, but the quality is very good and portions on several items are very generous.L'Etoile occupies a very nice space. The room is elegant but also contemporary and the huge windows allow a lot of great natural light to fill the room as well as allow patrons to view Madison's picturesque and lively capital square.I have not dined at many restaurants in Wisconsin, but I would imagine that L'Etoile has to be one of the very best.  It is one of the best Midwestern restaurants I have been to outside of Chicago.  With its focus on local farms, Wisconsin cheese, high quality beef, and contemporary cooking techniques/styles, L'Etoile is a great restaurant to experience cuisine that reflects both the chef's formal training at great restaurants as well as the high quality food that the midwest has to offer.Parking via pay lots/structures is available.Earlier this month, I celebrated my birthday in L'Etoile. As a foodie and local food supporter, I have heard so many good words about this place. I have been wanting to try it out during my 5 years in Madison. We finally made the move this year. I came out the restaurant being somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong. Everything was fancy. The staff was very professional. The ambiance was really classy. Food was delicate.  I come in with full preparation of the steep price (otherwise I would not wait for 5 years). However, I can hardly justify the experience with the $90 per person bill. It is pretty clear to me that L'Etoile is overpriced. In terms of food, 4 of us got Charcuterie, Pork Belly, and another beets dish for appetizers. They are all good, but without any true highlight. The portion is smallish. After I ate the pork belly, I somewhat really missed the pork belly I had in the A Pig in the Fur Coat...I had Branzino for entree. The fish itself was pretty delicious, but standard. The vegetables on the side has a slight hint of brunt smell that I found pretty odd. My brother and his girlfriend had lamb rack and scallop. Very average dish that you can get in an upscale restaurant. The biggest trouble of the night came with the steak for my wife. Since she is pregnant, she could not take raw meat. Therefore she asked the steak to be medium-well, but the steak came on the table being medium-rare. She had to ask the kitchen to re-do her plate. I guess such thing always happens but I was not expecting in L'Etoile. For dessert, we shared a Creme Boulee. It was, again, very average and with too much cream on the top. I could not find a memorable dish from the dinner. The food was delicious, but it failed to surprise me. When I pay close to a hundred dollar per person for a dinner, I really hope to see something more exciting. Nor do I understand the numerous 5-star reviews for this restaurant. Maybe this is something not meant to be enjoyed by poor students. Overall, classy, delicate, but somehow empty and overpriced. Thus a 3 stars.I ate at L'Etoile several weeks back for my best friend's 30th birthday and had a really, really mixed experience.  It was so mixed that the only way I can really review it is to list the pros and cons out side by side:+ Wait staff was really friendly, and prompt.  + The menu was customized for her birthday+ The knife cuts and cooking of every protein and vegetable was pretty much perfect every time.+ The beef dish with anchovy beurre blanc was probably one of the best things I'll ever eat in my life.+ The foie gras square with port reduction is definitely the best foie gras I will probably ever have.+ The caramelle pork pasta was stunning.  Flavorful, tender, and simply magical.  I could eat a bowl of it everyday and die happy.+ The after-dinner treat of the dark chocolate strawberry rhubarb truffle and yuzu pâte de fruit was stunning.  Should've been on the main menu it was so heavenly.- They kept on bringing us bread and asking if we wanted more, almost as if to fill us up on it - this seems a little bit degrading for a restaurant of this supposed caliber.- Several pairings just do not work.  Do not serve scallops with sweet potato and delicata squash - it is gross.  Do not serve foie gras pate inside a gougere with cranberry relish - it is dreadful and sour, and most definitely not in a good way.- The poached lobster in the lobster dish was rubbery and severely overcooked.  Squeaky and hard to get down.- The pastry chef doesn't know what they're doing.  The pumpkin mousse didn't taste of pumpkin, and the cranberry apple gastrique had far too much vinegar in it.  Sadly, there was far too much of it on the plate, making the whole dish become a vinegar and sugar bomb all at the same time.  The balance was nonexistent.In general, I guess it seems like they're really good with meats, but really terrible with fish and more importantly, balancing flavors with fish.  I probably would be back, but I would be extremely cautious about what I ordered.  They pick a lot of interesting and fun flavor combinations, but in our night out, a good half of them really fell flat.Had the 7-course tasting menu with wine pairing.  Totaled $205 per person.  Why do I mention price?  Because I don't really think it was worth it.  Sure, the food is good and the pairing worked well.  But the ingredients and flavors were hit-or-miss.  The scallop stole the show.  The lamb was great.  Octopus was a shame. But overall the food looked pretty but lacked the intense, complex, creative flavors I expect from a meal like this.  The service was acceptable but still felt very Madison (service in Madison is below par on average...sorry). In other words, it was a little too intrusive and 'peppy' for my taste.  A bit more professionalism and better grooming would help.  I still have trouble with the smooth jazz that they play in a space that still doesn't feel good.  Just feels a little cold and sterile overall.  Anyway, yeah, L'Etoile is good but the faux-pomp and sky-high prices just don't get me there.

Restaurant name  Sacks Art of Sandwicherie

Review Text :
I was so disappointed by my lunch at Sacks today. It reminded me of a place in Albuquerque called Baggins... but they fell way short on customer service and quality. While the patio was pretty full, there was no line and I was able to walk right up to the counter to order. No greeting. She took my order, no explanation. Although, I prompted by saying, "This is my first time here." Counterworker just stared blankly until I asked, "So do I wait here or do you call my name?" The sandwich was fine: egg salad, cream cheese and bacon on multigrain bread. Not the best I've ever had. I ate half then turned to the bite sized cookie as my reward. It was hard as a rock! I didn't even finish the shard that I bit off. I don't see any real reason to go back.

Restaurant name  Samurai Sam's

Review Text :
I went here for lunch last week. When I walked in the place was empty except for a lady behind the counter and a little boy about twelve. The little boy went behind the counter while I was ordering, and the lady proceeded to ask him to grab my egg role. He then proceeded to help her get the rest of my food. Needless to say I was a little grossed out. Apparently someone has never heard of food handler cards and that children are not to be in the kitchen much less handling the food. The food is decent but too often I go into these places and find workers sitting on the counter, talking on their phones while handling food etc. It's pretty gross. I'm told they don't have a c corporate number but someone definitely needs some retraining on handling food.There are three reasons I like Samurai Sam's: 1. Their teriyaki sauce 2. The low-cal options and the fact that I can chow down on an entire bowl of chicken, rice and veggies for four grams of fat3. The low-cal option for my fatty favorite, an egg roll -- four grams of fat.Yes this is a chain, but healthy chains get a star in my book so I'm giving to to Samurai Sam's. If there was only one closer to my home I would probably eat here way too much, but now I know that whenever I'm in the area, I will stop by and fill up on food that fills me without adding to the waistline. **** They also sell the teriyaki sauce.

So sue me...I like a chain once in a while.  I mean c'mon, decent coffee, comfy seating, free wifi and more than passable lunches.Would you hate me if I told you I knew where pretty much every Panera was from Connecticut to Maine?Seriously.  Can I write one generic review and just post it for all of them?  I mean chains go for consistent theme and product, shouldn't consistent reviews with a certain sameness be bestowed upon them if they succeed?Is the Panera just off the Maine turnpike in Augusta where I ate dinner and worked late one evening that different than the Panera in between the Connecticut turnpike and the Merritt Parkway or the Panera just off of Fort Eddy Road in Concord, New Hampshire?  Frankly, no it's not.As previously mentioned, my office is within a stone's throw of this place, so it's safe to say that I've been here 30-40 times since the last review. I usually grab an iced tea during the day; if I'm pressed for time at lunch, I'll grab a salad or something light.+ Don't let the lines deter you; they'll get you in-and-out quickly+ Cashiers are always friendly and helpful+ Menu changes frequently, especially the special salads+ Current favorite: Chicken Hummus Power Salad - it's quite tasty & very healthy+ Solid chicken noodle soup; consistently good- Items are a bit pricey (the aforementioned salad with a large iced tea is $10+)+ I dig the new buzzer system that alerts you when your meal is ready+ Great to-go containers- Needs a little more waiting room/space; tends to back-up during rushes+ Decent coffee+ Good rewards program for frequent diners/patrons+ Generally kept very cleanI'm originally from St Louis, so I understand why I couldn't find St. Louis Bread Co...I love the pecan rolls and coffee oh and wifi to read news. Place is very clean, I think the girl taking order was stressed that day. But no biggie I got my food fast and coffee was hot so no complaints.

Restaurant name  Pho An Hoa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Forget Pho Real (because it's not good and worth it) this restaurant is the best pho restaurant near my house. This is the restaurant I would go to if I had a craving for pho, and because I basically live right next to a string of pho restaurants I get to have a picking. Ben Thanh is right next door and I have tried both, so you can say I have experience of which one is better.Coming in here, the dining area is basically an extended hallway. Tables line right next to the windows and in the back, there are bathrooms. I remember back back in the day when I was a youngling, there used to be an arcade and my brother and I would go and play Galatica. Darn Aliens! Anyways, since the years have passed there have been several owners and now it's nicer and cleaner.I usually order either Goi Cuon (Fresh spring rolls) or Cha Gio (Fried spring rolls) along with my Dac Biet (Pho with basically everything in it). The reason why I say this place is better than most Pho restaurants is because:1. It's cheap. Pho, shouldn't be expensive.2. The amount you get is well worth the money. The amount of noodles compared to other places is a huge difference. If you get the largest size, I guarantee you'll be full. In comparison to other places where the portions are so ridiculous, even if you order their largest size you're still hungry after.3.  The broth and quality of the soup. Yes, maybe some other places have a better broth, but lets face it... We're here for the noodles and everything else that comes with it, not the soup. However, the soup does flavor the noodles and gives the overall dish its umph. But, if there's more soup than noodles that's where the problem lies.So you must be wondering what Dac Biet is. Dac Biet is basically Pho (thin rice noodles) and inside the broth comes the meats. Of course there's different types of meats you can order, but Dac Biet is basically a combination of all the meats. So Tripe, Meatballs, Tendon, Beef Flank, etc. There's a good amount of meat in this, which is why I crave it so.Overall, this place is delicious. An Hoa is a hole in the wall type of place, but you know what that means. They have best stuff, well at least around this area. (For the South Side, look for my review of Saigon Palace) But overall, if you're in the area and craving for Pho come here and you won't be disappointed.

Restaurant name  Pino's Pizza Al Centro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Great neighborhood dining.  Pino really makes the place worth the visit.  His Southern Italian charm and care really shine in the way the food is prepared and guests are served.I recommend that you always review the daily specials before making a decision.  If there is nothing that meets your tastes then the following two dishes receive my personal guarantee.- Spaghetti Bolognese: Don't eat it all because it is better the next day.- Calzone: I defy you to find a better one in Phoenix.Having a class at Phoenix College from 1 to 2 works out pretty well for the fat girl trapped inside of my skinny body. I'm on a mission to try new places everyday after class since it's near central Phoenix. Anywayyyy, I have passed by this place a bunch of times and I finally decided to look it up on yelp...it had such good reviews on yelp! I was so excited to try it! After class, I drive my happy ass down there and I walk in and thought it was closed...I was going to get my order to go but I had time to kill so I decided to have it there. I went with the margherita pizza. So there were cons with my experience but the one that took the cake was this: a lady (I presume it was the owners wife) and some guy were sitting there having some sort of meeting about getting new wines...this lady looked like she had done meth for too long and botched plastic surgery; what a bitch she was. She was talking down to the girl in front, she was discussing the fact that she wanted to fly to Texas and beat her kids ass (how pleasant. At that moment I wanted to beat her ass). Then she starts talking about how DUMB college graduates are these days...umm...hello! College graduate here! Then she makes eye contact with me and asks me what I ordered. So weird. The guy sitting there was nice though. I felt bad for having to deal with her. The owner was there...he didn't say hi to me. He didn't ask how the pizza was, he didn't do anything. Maybe I'm spoiled but owners usually love me...especially Italian ones. Onto the pizza. It was good. It wasn't anything spectacular. I've had better. I wouldn't ever go out of my way to go there. Actually I wouldn't even go there if I ran into the place. So disappointing!

Restaurant name  Habib's Persian Cuisine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I called to inquire about their menu and was meet with some resistance. the person who answered the phone would only tell me to come in and see the decor and and menu. i thought it was a joke and asked again but to no avail didn't get anywhere. this place put a bad taste in my mouth...ssh.This was the worst Persian food I have ever had. The service was even worse than the food. I will never go there again, I have been in many persian restaurants in LA and the Bay Area, this one stands at the bottom of the list. I recommend anything else but Habib.NO STAR! Went to Habib's with my elder parents/family, Habib the owner also server snapped impatiently right when we walked-in to get seated.  He seemed to be having a bad day and took it out on my parents and I.  He took my moms order and when my mom mentioned she does not want her food overly cooked he was impatient and rude.  My dad wanted to get seated over by the window and he was denied.  When he asked for an explanation, Habib said to him I'm diabetic and can not carry the food from the kitchen to the widow seat near the entry where my dad preferred to get seated.  Habib said to my dad I'm the owner also management here and I won't allow you to sit there if you don't like it then leave.  By then Habib had taken five of our orders, when it was my turn to order, I was the only one at the table who's order was not taken by Habib, taken-back by Habib's rude behavior I set down the menu and didn't want to order food, therefore, he asked me to leave on front of my family and raced to my seat as well as personal space as if he's going to hit me.  I got up, words were exchanged and he ran to the front grabbing a phone and threatening to call the police.  We were certainly not treated with any respect.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE.  Habib is a rude jerk and don't know what else to say. That was 30 minutes into our arrival to Las Vegas and starting our family vacation.I took a party of 6 friends and co-workers there last week when attending a tradeshow in Vegas ... I will never do that again!Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as "tax" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip?  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  3. Why is listed as "tax"?  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge?  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.  I will not recommend this place:  not for food, not for service and not for being overcharged!It was 4:00 pm when we got there. It is a very nice place . But Nobody was in the front desk like 5 minutes. A young boy who doesn't know anything about being a waiter showed up. Led us to a table . then we waited like 15 min to be taken an order. Finally , after 35 min we received our lunch while it was not fresh.we asked for the owner after 10 min he showed up. The owner couldn't stand to even listen our opinion.Any way , i don't recommend expecting good service over there.Amazing quality and freshness hidden in an unassuming location. The exterior really doesn't reflect the prices and service you'll find here- I can see some people walking in, taking one look at the menu and hightailing it out. I was almost one of them! But BF insisted we stick around, because years ago he was blown away by the food.I am happy to agree that the food, years later, is still legitimately amazing. The bread basket has three different kinds of pita and other carby deliciousness, which all go perfectly with the HERBS & FETA appetizer ($7), plated with fresh mint, tarragon, basil, and vegetables. The KOOBIDEH and CHICKEN KABOB plates ($15/ea) both had heaps of heavenly rice and roasted tomatoes, plus tender and well-seasoned skewers. The chicken was some of the best I've had, juicy and flavorful throughout.They have a variety of kabob plates and more traditional dishes like stews, but the prices are going to be steeper than you expect- average entrée is $20-30 but again, the quality is top notch. The service also deserves a shout out, as the staff are exceedingly professional. Interior is much classier than the location and exterior might suggest. Heavy carved wood chairs, white linen table clothes, fresh flowers on each table. Your date may even get a long-stemmed rose with the check!Don't forget to check out the attached grocery market on your way out.

Restaurant name  McDonald's
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I currently view McDonald's as more of a restaurant serving inexpensive snacks than meals. In my opinion, McDonald's is a level or few below the fast food powerhouses starring In N Out, Raising Cane's, and Panda Express. When dinner is far in the horizon and I want to calm my appetite, I order off the McDonald's $1 menu as I look forward to a better meal. The $1 menu features large fountain Coke beverages, a sausage buritto, a hot & spicy chicken sandwich, a double cheeseburger,  small coffee, and other foods.   Both my check-ins here were when I hiked on the Angel Park Trail system. This McDonald's is convenient to the Angel Park Trail system; which includes the Bonanza Trail, Kellogg Sport's Complex, and Lone Mountain Trail. The restaurant is a convenient respite from outdoor activities. To reach this McDonald's from the Angel Park Trail system; from Bonanza Trail which is really the east spur of Angel Park Trail to you'd walk past the Kellogg Sport's Complex, walk under the Buffalo Drive tunnel and after the K-Mart turn left on Lone Mountain Trail. After Crossing Washington Avenue with a pedestrian signal, you'd turn left and McDonald's is on the right.  As far as location,  I am curious why McDonald's passed over building the restaurant at the corner of Buffalo at Washington. The existing restaurant a few thousand feet east of Buffalo Drive on Washington Avenue is out of sight lines for motorists driving on Buffalo Drive one traffic signal north of Summerlin Parkway. Then again being McDonald's there is another location a couple of traffic lights north at Buffalo and Lake Mead Boulevard.    This is an older McDonald's. This is not surprising considering it is near Kmart. There is no theme. Just a basic McDonald's with a dining and indoor playground area.  The two check-ins in this basic McDonald's were for a snack. On my first check-in,  I quaffed down the limited time Chocolate strawberry Frape. It was a yummy caffeine boost at a cost of $4 and 600-plus calories. Fortunately this was the halfway point of my hike and I'd burn some of it off. On my follow-up check-in,  I snacked on a Hot & Spicy Chicken with a large Coke. The Coke was flat. That is a no no! If the service wasn't decent and there wasn't a manager presence, this review would fall flat of 3 stars and sink to 2 stars.   I try to review places when I am a regular. Now that I am a Duke that will probably see that status fade at this location, it is time to emphasize that this is a decent restaurant for a snack or light meal off the Angel Park Trail system and in the vicinity of Washington at Buffalo.This has got to be one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever had the pleasure of waiting in line for! I only ordered medium sized french fries and a hot chocolate, and it took at least 20 minutes to finally get my order!  And to top that off, when it was finally my turn at the window, it took them 5 minutes to open the window to tell me that my order will be ready shortly! You may think I am exaggerating, but I am not! Hopefully my next time there will not be as horrendous!This McDonald's is connected to the Terrible's convenience store/gas station and not particularly one of my favorites.It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby.The last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen.  Apparently she was on break (and eating) and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues, so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they, in turn, hollered back.  Very professional group here.I'm sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well.ahhhhh just got home after getting drive thru at this location. i really considered turning around and going back but gave up on the thought. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of BBQ sauce. heres what i gota spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere. a medium fry that was literally half full, honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating, it was about a third full. and guess what no BBQ sauce BUT an open ketchup packet that got everywhere. BRAVO... BRAVO. and this is why i rarely eat fast food.After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango.  I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack.  Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy.  Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88.A shiny, bronzed group of Chicken McNuggets with formed pretend-tatoes in a 4-color box served by a high-school student or college intern and a toy to boot?? From the drive-thru even? Where can I  pay money?? I  want to pay real money for this! And afterward, I  want to gas up my car, yup! Then I  want to play bad vintage top 40 music blasting on my factory car radio system "I  wanna be a cowboy. And you can be my cowgirl."I  showed up at 430am looking for a quarter pounder and they were only serving breakfast, even though the sign says differently. Another time I  showed up at 1030am and tried to order breakfast and they stopped serving breakfast.I  really think this Mickey D's is cray cray adorbs. 4 r e al z.

Review Text :
The last time I was in Smoky's was back in 1989.  I was in high school, rockin' a perm, sportin' my Z Cavarrici pants, a mock turtleneck, and kickin' some Air Jordans (no, seriously).  All I remember from that experience were the relish tray and the sizzling hot plates that the steaks arrived on.Fast forward 23 years.I was invited to a dinner with two very good friends and they suggested we hit Smoky's.  The three of us arrived to Smoky's at around 7pm on Saturday, found a parking spot, and wandered in to the fabled establishment (sans my Z Cav's - I left them at home).We took a seat at the horseshoe-shaped bar, where Madison's infamous mixologist, "Martini Bob," greeted us as if we were long-lost friends.  What an outstanding guy - friendly, personable, and more than capable of creating a mind-bending beverage.  My pals went with martinis; I chose a brew.The tap selection was modest but decent; I opted for a Samuel Adams Lager.  I wasn't old enough to drink during my previous visit, but I imagine the bar hasn't changed much since the 80s.  And that's A-OK by me.  The place was cozy, comfortable, and truly enjoyable.  After a few sips of our beverages, we ordered some breaded mushrooms with the house-made ranch sauce.  Both arrived in short order and boy-howdy, were they excellent.  I'd highly recommend giving them a shot.A host dropped by to ask if we'd like to grab a table; we did, and were led into one of the smaller dining room areas.  A four-top table awaited, complete with a relish bowl that consisted of carrots, celery, scallions, and radishes.  I'd swear I could hear the theme song from "Saved By The Bell" ringing in my ears.An incredibly friendly server dropped by with menus and to check on the status of our drinks.  We ordered a glass of Cabernet and browsed the menu.After a very short wait, we placed our orders - three fillets (medium rare), hashbrowns, and mushrooms.  When given the option between a glass of tomato juice or a basil tomato soup, we went for the soup.Bob dropped by to see how we were doing, and inquired about our wine choice.  He suggested a Malbec rather than the Cab, and went to get us a sample.  Upon his return, we took a sip and agreed the Malbec was the better bet.  Bob is awesome.  Totally awesome.Cups of soup, along with a bread basket arrived in short order.  The soup was fantastic - hints of basil complimented the tomato flavor; I sopped-up the remainder of my soup with some bread... manners-be-damned... Salads arrived and consisted of fresh greens, homemade croutons, a little onion, and a few cherry tomatoes.  And before you could say Murphy Brown, our steaks were presented - sizzling hot plates and all!  I giggled with delight, and then drooled with anticipation as I spied the hashbrowns - the plate of crispy goodness looked awesome.We cut into our uber-thick steaks and they were perfectly cooked - a stunning medium rare.  Content with our bounty, the waiter left us to our meals.  The steaks were superb.  Super tender, full of flavor and just divine.  The hashbrowns were as stellar as they looked - crispy yet tender and surprisingly flavorful.  A side of mushrooms rounded out the flavor profiles - I'd recommend you get these as well.All in all, this was an other-worldly experience, and I can't wait to go back.  The price was more than fair; service was top-notch; the food was as good as I've ever had.  It looks like they've also refreshed the dining rooms a bit.Smoky's = WINFood = 4.75 starsService = 4.75 starsValue = 4.75 starsMISC = 5 starsI really didn't know what to expect. I drive by Smoky's Club every week and it easily goes unnoticed. Coming here was like meeting the quiet kid in the back and realizing this was the most interesting person in the room. I almost ordered the veggie lasagna, but then my red wine came so I went for steak. The steak comes sizzling on a metal platter. You can salt and pepper it if you like, but what more do you need than well-sizzled meat. A relish bucket filled with ice, crunchy radishes, carrots, celery, and curling scallions will sit at your table for dipping into between bites of steak. Is this what eating is supposed to be like? I have not yet lived.  They have a house Roquefort dressing, which is like french dressing with chunks of blue cheese. Another house specialty, their hashbrowns, come round, crispety and buttery. The tables are uncluttered, no caddies hovering with crusty A1 bottles, as this place keeps it classy. And the napkins were so soft. Is it paper? Is it cloth? I haven't gotten to the best part -- the attention to service. No small talk, just an announcement of the soup and featured vegetable of the day. When soup arrived, the bowl was carefully turned so the spoon was facing my dominant hand. We were asked minimal questions like, "do you have everything you need?" at which point we did request ketchup and it came promptly and with purpose. Our waters were filled in comfortable silence. No desserts or drinks were pushed on us. No lecture on how hot the plate would be. It's hard to describe the absence of something, but we were treated like people with sense and autonomy, and it was glamorous. As we left, I wondered if this place could be the Ritz-Carlton of steakhouses. Or...just a regular supper club. Had I been living under a rock?The best martini list I have ever seen--the menu is thicker than the Monday New York Times. Martinis range from sweet to tart and spicy with a lot of great variation. The portions are extremely generous. After 1 I was in probably one of the best moods I've ever been in. A friend described the martinis as "betch bomb good". I'm not sure what that means but I agree. Atmosphere is relatively quiet and laid back. There is enough room for a party or a small group of friends. And on the plus side, it's easy to reach and on a bunch of bus lines (safe driving!). I love this place

I was in the area for work and stopped in for a salad- the space is literally a walkup counter with a couple of benches, definitely a takeout-only kind of space. There aren't any pics posted of the menu, and there wasn't one available for me to take, so for a basic overview, they have pizza, calzones, burgers, sandwiches, gyros, chicken fingers/wings, and a ton of apps (fries, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, etc). Oh, and salads- three kinds. I opted for the grilled chicken, and there was ample protein and the portion was large. Priced at $9, the produce was super fresh, and there was a choice of three dressings. The house blue cheese tasted like a low-priced bulk-jar generic, but it was certainly one of the larger, fresher salads I've had at a run-down pizza joint.Service was friendly and fast. Space doesn't have much ambiance. They have a 75-cent credit card charge. Prices are fairly low and portions across the board seem to be large, based on other orders I saw being picked up.

I was on my way to Port of Subs but it was crazy packed and I hate crowds so I kept driving and found this place thought I'd give it a try. Oops My bad!! The kid was nice behind the counter when I asked what was good. I ordered what he suggested a 6 inch Italian type club for my meat eating brother and a what seemed harmless enough a stuffed tomato w egg salad for myself along w drinks, chips, and a cookie for the kid to go. It was $17. He even gave me a box to carry the drinks safely! I get to my bro's and we sit down to eat. I open my box and it was ahem a layer of lettuce on the bottom with a totally unripe light pink tomato cut into wedges w the egg salad poured on top. Ummmm it was bad folks I couldn't even bare to take a picture. There was nothing good about this or worth the $6 it cost. My bro is like Mikey he will eat anything well he ate the sandwich but it was drenched with ranch WTF I dont remember asking for ranch. It also had the same pink tomato's in it. Honestly not sure how this place stays open when even Subway would be better. This place gets 2 thumbs down. Maybe breakfast would be better!?!?

So, I moved back to the Bay Area 6 years ago this week. Last week, I was in Phoenix and met with some friends from high school who I haven't seen in 9 and 11 years respectively. Our 20 year HS reunion is next month and since I am not going, decided we should have our own mini type reunion and this was a place easy enough for all of us to meet up. Yes this is a chain, and yes when in Phoenix I play the chain game. When this restaurant was built, it was all the rage. I used to work for a company close by and this was the place we would go to for recognition type lunches, etc. The portions were huge, there was a salad bar (yep this seems eons ago) and service was great. There was always a line and if you showed up at dinner time, you had to be prepared for a 1+ hour wait. We all met at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. No line outside, no one waiting inside and we were seated immediately. This told me right away that either the economy has taken a real toll or that the Claim Jumper isn't jumping anymore. We were seated and all just started gabbing away. We all had non alcoholic beverages and warned the waitress we would be there for the long haul with gabbing, etc. so if she needed us to leave so she could get more tables to let us know. Heads up folks visiting AZ from CA-any wait staff in AZ DOES NOT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE. They make around $4.25 an hour now (used to be $2.12) and have to depend on tips. This is why I find service in AZ to typically be stellar compared to service here. They have a smaller menu than they used to and also offer smaller plates. We all had something different-me a spinach salad and a big ass baked potato. My friends had a chicken sandwich of sorts and the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. We were all satisfied and my friends each took part of their meal home. We also all shared a coffee ice cream mud pie. It didn't taste as good as I remembered it, but it was a nice end to the meal. The desserts are still larger than life and even with 3 women gabbing and noshing, we left about a third of it. The waitress was great-the restaurant still never got busy and we ended up closing the place down (that would be 10pm)! The three of us then ended up sitting outside in front of the restaurant and gabbed and gabbed until well after midnight. It was a great evening and a nice place to have played catch up with old friends (none of us are 40 yet so they wouldn't like me calling them "old"). I drove back to my mom's and parked the car, took off my shoes and walked through the house on my tip toes. Kind of like how I used to come home in high school but I wasn't drunk or stoned...I normally hold off on writing reviews for chain places but I met up with some girlfriends for lunch on a Sunday that wanted to hear about my trip and they said let's do lunch at Claim Jumpers, so off I went.We were seated right away by the manager, who was very friendly & nice and our server for the meal was Vanessa, and let me tell you Vanessa loves her job she was superb job, she is what inspired me to write this review. From the start of the meal to the end of the meal she was present thoughtful and helpful even offered us some tea to go when we left. I was in the mood for a salad so I went with bbq chicken salad it was perfectly prepared but it visually it looked amazing, the greens, the red of the tomato so vivid in color, and the best part it tasted great too!I can honestly say that I haven't been to a Claim Jumpers in a few years and I am happy that I did that Sunday afternoon! Great company, great food, excellent service.

Okay, so hard to believe I am the FTR of this Garcia's location since it has been here for eon's (and looks like it) and is still one of the staple restaurants around the Metro Center area that hasn't closed down or changed. The food is the same as it has been for the last 15+ years. Decent, not great and sadly, the shredded beef in the taco I had tasted like it was boiled without any flavors or seasoning. For those of you reading this review who have never been to Phoenix (Arizona at all in fact) you may not be aware of the greasy deliciousness called a cheese crisp. This is seriously where it is at pretty much all over the Valley. Garcia's does make a fine cheese crisp and for that, I am still grateful and willing to go. The one good thing I can say is the restaurant still seems to have a hopping bar area with live music a few nights a week. Good for the happy hour crowd, but since I was there with my mom and a cousin for lunch, it didn't do anything for me knowing this. Word of warning to ladies who need to potty while in the restaurant area...The bathroom is as old as the rest of the place. One toilet so if you drink a lot, be prepared to wait your turn.

Restaurant name  Golden Flower Chinese Cuisine

Review Text :
This was a surprisingly very pleasant find for fine and stalwart, dead-ahead Cantonese cuisine!  Complimentary fried sticks presented in a small bowl were tasty dipped in the fragrant Sweet and Sour Sauce provided.  Egg Drop Soup was among the best I have ever tried.  And, Wor Won Ton Soup was very fine, with chicken, shrimp, pork, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, carrots, bok choy, napa cabbage, and excellent pork-filled wontons.  Pan-fried Potstickers were simple but very good, and I was cheerfully supplied with all of my favorite dipping sauces.  Springy Vegetarian Egg Rolls were greasy but good, and as another appetizer very breaded Fried Shrimp were shaped in fat circles, but juicy shrimp lay inside those massive rings.Orange Chicken was succulent.  Chicken Chow Mein was very good.  Walnut Shrimp was a little mayonnaisey but also quite tasty.  And the beef and snow peas in Beef with Pea Pods were tender and very good, as well.    Portions were huge!  In fact, our table for four diners was so laden with food that a man from an adjoining table came over to remark at what a fine feast we had laid out before us, and to tell us how much he enjoyed this restaurant.  When he learned that I would be reviewing the restaurant on Yelp.com he winced, saying that he hoped the secret of his neighborhood eatery would not leak out too far.  But it already has!  Golden Flower was the 2012 Staff Pick for Best Chinese Restaurant in Best of Las Vegas.  For good reason, as I learned!Service was friendly and impeccable.  The restaurant is small but seating was comfortable.  Prices are very reasonable.  In fact, the only negative thing that I can report is that the tea was not hot enough on the first run.  But this was quickly and cheerfully remedied with a new, steaming pot.When you crave Cantonese cuisine, this is a place that will most assuredly assuage that craving!BEST OF LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL 2012Okay, officially it's not quite in Hendertucky but it's darn close.  Just happens to be a couple miles northwest from my doctor's office off of Whitney Ranch and Sunset Roads. And we arrived within minutes of the curtailment of their luncheon specials of $5.95 & $6.95. We ordered their lunch specials Curry Chicken with wonton soup plus Spicy Shrimp Braised with hot & sour soup. Both of us agree it was most authentic and enjoyable. The wonton is made with a thick skin which is not our preference. Fried noodles accompanied by a dish of sweet & sour sauce plus mustard is a tell tale sign of their primary customer base.Now tell me where can you go for an entree accompanied with a heaping portion of bbq pork fried rice, bowl of soup, egg roll and crab puff for these prices?  If your first concern is about the quality and authenticity... the answer is nowhere else. If you're worried about quantity... you need not fret.We also ordered for takeout Beef Chow Fun and Singapore Rice Noodles. Their Beef Chow Fun is the best I've had had in Las Vegas in a long long time. Haven't gotten to the Singapore noodle entree. It's still in the refrigerator. I'll update this review when I get to the Singapore noodle.Wow after sitting bookmarked in my Yelp log I finally got my booty over to check out what all the fuss is about!We were not disappointed and found out first hand what all of the rave reviews were about!We started with a hot pot of Oolong tea which is a nice option and treat when dining out for Chinese and that is not always an option elsewhere.We ordered an appetizer of fried shrimp and it was yummy, the shrimp and the fried coating was delicious.We also decided on an order of sweet and sour shrimp which was very good as well! It was more of the same yummy fried shrimps mixed with carrots, onions, and bell pepper in a delicious sweet and sour sauce which comes with white rice.We also ordered almond chicken which was full of white meat chicken, generous fresh slithered almonds in an Amazing light brown sauce that had a hint of sweetness.This is a true Cantonese style Chinese restaurant which has always been my favorite.Golden Flower reminds me of the exceptional Cantonese restaurants we would eat at back in the 80's in the Pacific NW.The service is great and the prices are Outstanding especially considering their generous portions! Our bill for an appetizer and two full entrees was $24 which was ridiculous good considering all of the food we were served, we even had to take some home as we could not finish it all. The Quality, Service, Flavor, Portions and fair pricing is alive at the Golden Flower."After being on a cross country flight from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas to meet up with my brother and a week on vacationing on the Strip, I was anxious to see a real locals restaurant. My brother drove me to a nice Chinese restaurant in a happening Von's shopping center called Golden Flower. " In reality if Yelp was in existence ten years ago in the summer of 2014 this is how I would of started the review. Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant holds a place in my heart because it is one of if not the first locals Chinese restaurant that I visited in Las Vegas when I was living in Fort Lauderdale ten years ago. For at least ten years Golden Flower has been blooming in the very injured shopping center at the corner of Pecos and Russell Roads. Where this shopping centers Von's, Denny's, New York Bagel shop, Starbuck's, and so on rest in peace, the spirit of Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant is alive.   It was yesterday before I attended the Alcohol Awareness Training class that I wanted to take advantage of a nearby Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. After a near decade hiatus, I was returning to Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant.   Golden Flower is still the same cozy Chinese restaurant as I remember back when the Outcasts "Hey ya" was topping the charts. It brings back further memories of the cozy Chinese restaurants in Long Island, New York. The oldies from the 1980s and 1990s added to the relaxing environment. Listening to the acoustic version of "Hotel California" made each bite of the shrimp chow mein that much more enjoyable.   More than the cozy environment and music, the service left me with a better taste of the Golden Flower. From the time I stepped inside to when I paid, Christie was very welcoming. She invited me to sit at any table in the relatively small dining room that was sparsely populated by diners. She was on top of refills and would always say, "Thank you." Ultimately she never rushed me. I'd overhear a couple of customers thank Christie for the great service.   The luncheon specials are a good deal. They are in affect Monday to Saturday from 11 am to 3 pm. In similar style to the luncheon specials throughout the Las Vegas Valley the price is between $5.95 and $6.95. the reality is that when you add a glass of Coke, tip, and tax it comes out to the figure of $11. But the Coke could be unnecessary because I vividly recall the delicious hot tea here. Let me talk more about the lunch specials. They include either egg drop or hot and sour soup. But, if you love wonton soup like I do, it is $2.25 per person. There is more. The lunch special also includes an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce and spicy mustard and either BBQ pork fried rice or steamed rice. The lunch special features an entree. The choices include numerous styles of chow mein, pepper steak, curry chicken, and sweet and sour chicken (I posted a picture of the menu in this business listing).    I ordered the shrimp chow mein luncheon special. The crunchy noodles were decent. I am a fan of the wide noodles and not the skinny ones they serve here. Regardless they went good with the spicy mustard. Before I could get more acquainted with the noodles, Christie placed the hot and sour soup on the white tablecloth. The soup tasted hot and sour. The next visit I intend to pay the $2.25 for the wonton soup. The egg roll which reminded me of a spring roll was Panda Express allright. Now the portion of the shrimp chow mein with fried rice was enormous. The quality was magnificent. In a couple of my previous reviews on Las Vegas Chinese Restaurants I voice my opinion that the chow mein noodles are filler food. Golden Flower serves flavorful chow mein that hint of lo mein sprinkled with generous amounts of chunky juicy appetizing shrimp and sprinklers of onions. This is an example of both quantity and quality. The Best of Las Vegas has bestowed Golden Flower with The Best of Vegas awards in 2002, 2008, and 2012.  In hindsight, I am cognizant of the fact that somethings stay the same. In the period of a decade Golden Flower is still the same local Chinese Restaurant serving remarkable Chinese food luncheon specials in a cozy environment. In the period of a decade I remain a fan of Golden Flower.Mmmmmm I make a visit here for my Chinese cravings when I am in need of a mouth orgasm. They give it to me fresh, clean, and generous in which I always leave filled up just how I like.I tried the general so chicken on this last visit and boy I was in a sea of bliss with this delicious dish!I have been craving it since, I dream of it, I need it, I want it more and more.I have 12 check ins at Golden Flower and every single dish I try is just as Amazing. The staff is Fantastic, the food is top quality and the prices are low for the giant portions.Their war wonton soup is a delicious meal in itself as well for those cold nights! It is full to the brim with shrimp, bbq pork, chicken, veggies and wontons! A must try!

Review Text :
I wanted to enjoy this restaurant...I really did, considering that's it's locally owned and in the hot Montford area. However; my recent visit was a little disappointing. Decided to sit outside because there was a shady spot on the small patio area (3 tables). Was offered the buffet by the hostess and the waitress, but wanted to see the menu as well. While they were getting the menus I decided to check out the buffet. My initial reaction was a short giggle, as the buffet is just a few pizza choices (4-5) I believe, and a big stainless bowl that had salad it in and it looked like it was doused in dressing. Um, no thanks. Started with an order of the mozzarella sticks, which were good...nothing fancy. When asking the waitress what pizza she recommended she said I'm not sure, I don't eat it (hmmm?). I was a little taken back by that and asked the wife if I heard her correctly after she left and she said I did. Anyway, that comment aside, decided to get the eggplant special pizza with sun-dried tomatoes on the side. Special pizza is suppose to come with eggplant, provolone, garlic and parmesean. Then we added half of sun dried tomatoes. Even pointed to the menu to make sure the waitress got it right...size was 15". Well after the mozza sticks the pizza came out and at first glace I knew it was wrong because half the pizza had eggplant and the other half had sun dried tomatoes. The pizza also had so much oil/grease on it, I had to go back inside and get extra napkins to pat it down. Decided to let the obvious misorder go and try the pizza...sure enough, just a cheese pizza with a topping on each half. This was reaffirmed when the check came and it said 1/2 sun dried, 1/2 eggplant. Not what I ordered. A small item that no red pepper flakes were brought out or on the table so I had to go back inside and get them from a table. We were also charged for an extra drink we did not get. When I asked the waitress what the extra charge was she said it was for our 2 drinks. I reminded her politely that we only had 1 drink and a water. Without apologizing for the honest mistake, she just looked at the person I was paying and said remove a drink and walked away. All and all, a "eh" experience. Recommendations...spruce up the buffet and leave the dressing off the side and make sure the pizza is labeled and fresh. Also, better knowledge of the menu by the waitstaff so answering questions and looking for recommendations aren't returned with awkward responses. Bummer...potential is there...Ehhhh it breaks my heart to write less than stellar things about a pizza joint, even more so about a local pizza joint. I've been on the prowl for delicious pizza - of any kind (NY or Chicago) for more than three years now. Thus I was really, REALLY hoping that Luisa's dished out a delicious pie. The overall experience really left me with "meh."Hubs and I walked into Luisa's to enjoy a relaxed Friday afternoon meal and wanted to sit outside to enjoy the great weather. Our initial greeting from the gentleman (owner? manager?) was so sweet - he genuinely seemed happy to help us. I had high hopes at that point...and then our waitress took over and it went down hill...fast.We decided to forgo the buffet and order an appetizer of mozzarella sticks and a 'za - intending to take some home. The mozza sticks were good...however I've never had a bad piece of fried cheese. Then we waited for our 'za - not too long, though! In 15 - 20 minutes or so our pie came out...wrong. The waitress must have misinterpreted our order, but no worries...we decided to eat it anyway. That's all on us...not complaining about that. The problems were 1) the waitress never brought us silverware, red pepper flakes, extra napkins, etc., so hubs kept going inside to grab these necessary items. Tres annoying. 2) the pizza was full of grease. I'm normally a "pizza blotter" anyway, but this was an obscene amount of grease. Ack. After I blotted away, the pizza was just ok - not very inspired. Very little flavor and super bland. I expected a tasty, crispy crust too, considering the "brick oven"...but alas it was sub par. We brought the majority of the pizza home...and I don't think we ever ate it. That tells you something because I will typically eat pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As Todd W. said - we both really wanted to like Luisa's but it just fell short. Maybe the waitress and the brick ovens were having an off day? Sad 'za, sad face.Stopped by Luisa's for their lunch pizza deal and was pleased. While it's not great pizza, it is absolutely very good pizza. Brick oven baked, rather than the usual gas oven stuff, it is a bit more charred around the edges and this adds a different flavor - a good one - to the pie.The buffet has a salad which is nice and tasty, but don't decieve yourself into thinking that's a healthier choice than the pizza. It's got a good amaount of dressing on it. And really, you're at a pizza place. Have the pizza!And for the pizza choices, it was a nice variety though not spectacular. The focus here is on the tasty crust and not the creative toppings. What are you expecting for $9? Pepperoni and sausage and peppers and mushrooms and the like. The pesto-topped pizza was tasty.A very nice lunch option at a great lunch price for very tasty brick-oven pizza. I can see why Luisa's is so popular!

Review Text :
Back in the day, and I'm talking 1991/92, Fuddruckers was rad. They would receive whole sides of beef to grind for burgers, they baked everything in-house, made their own ice creams, had amazing table service, and had a relatively great soda jerk atmosphere. It was awesome. Now? It's kind of like the burger joint that time forgot. Sad people sitting multiple tables apart from one another whilst eating over-cooked meat on poorly-executed buns. Though the buns are baked fresh daily, they lack any sort of "pop" to showcase any deftness within the bakers' hands. Just sad and flavorless. The atmosphere seems to be more arcade-centric than food/service-centric. There are so many games on either side of the restaurant. It's pretty funny. I ordered the 1/2lb burger and asked for medium rare. What I received was a pretty fantastically well done patty of sadness. Even dressed with a few pickles and barbecue sauce, there was no seeing through the unfortunate event that happened in that kitchen. Bummer. Will I return? HA! No way. Fuddruckers used to be something wonderful. Now, it may just need to be put out to pasture. All puns intended.Pros... Quick, good, cooked right, self serve condiments, friendly staff. Good choice of size and type of meat. fresh buns, self serve drinks. Good Good Good.Cons... The place is a little run down, they sometimes no self serve trash bins.

Review Text :
I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.FOOD - 4 StarsI was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.After a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.I attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.Overall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  See the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.Will I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels.There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and this place is one of them. The food is made fresh to order. If you order inside or the drive-thru you should be prepared to wait. Since they are making it fresh it can take a while.First, get familiar with the size of the burgers here because they can get B-I-G! They have combo meals or you can easily just get a burger to satisfy your hunger.  Here are burger sizes:Small - 2.5ozMedium - 5.3ozLarge - 8ozXXL - 16ozXXXL - 24ozAs you can see they have a size for any stomach. There are also a nice variety of toppings you can add to your burger.They have a variety of crispy and grilled sandwich options. If you prefer turkey or veggie burgers they have them too!You can also choose from chicken strips, hot dogs, and salads.They have "fat" and "skinny" fries.Grilled onions, jalapenos, and peppers are available upon request.The shakes are ALL very good! Try one *if* you have room after your meal :)If you like breakfast check them out for that sometime they have a pretty good bacon and egg sandwich.now this is the "best" hamburger around. huge, thick & juicy really flavorful. the relish & pickles just kill. the onion rings were super-fresh hot & crispythis place is great-it doesn't matter where it's located in a food court or a stand-alone shop. they are always consistent. every thing is made to order. and the burgers always leave you wanting more. I lived across the street from in & out burger for 3 years-they are good but-fatburger is #1. always good service, fast & friendly staff, place is always clean & the decor is traditional burger stand. we love it!!!Get yourself a baby fat meal with fat fries & a shake you won't regret it. Voted Best Fast-Food Burger!

This falls into the something to do before you die category. It's no longer called Joni's as Joni took off to run some other place. But the new owner's are awesome. So, there's a short order cook there named Mary. Imagine if the Soup Nazi was a shorter, slightly older woman and secretly the sweetest person on Earth once you put in your six years as a state employee and got to know her.  And imagine she makes a breakfast burrito so good you spend $3700 and hours standing in the line to order it over the course of your six years there. The breakfast burrito Mary makes is simply the best breakfast option in the state. No joke. I defy anyone to show me something better. Go there some morning. Order the burrito. Friday's there's chorizo. Change your life. Don't be afraid. There's a whole unexplored world out there. Tell her Dallas sent you and she may not yell at you for your shitty ordering technique.

When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in the get-toe, take yo' phat ass to Diner 50.Cool retro joint, nice staff, adequate diner food.You'll find it on 19th Ave somewhere between Van Buren and Buckeye. Someone told me it was there and I saw it with my own eyes. It's amazing inside! (Notice how I avoided speaking of the outside.)Not seeing a veggie burger option on the menu, I put in a special request for one of the burgers sans the meat patty. My preference for vegetarian eats was accommodated quite well with good customer service. They fixed me up with a sand-which actually turned out to be a veggie sloppy joe of mushrooms, zucchini, onions, and peppers on bun with lettuce and tomato. Juicy! A side of medium hand cut fries with skin on (yum!) came with. And for my sweet tooth - uh, I mean for the owners - just to let them know that the sign out front with 'apple pie' written in big letters was useful, I also ordered a slice of dessert. Dessert FirstDessert FirstDessert First(That's going to be the next movement I join. You should join too, it's very proactive.)By the way, other restaurants in the area are fast food and Mexican food.

What makes this americhino boofay different from all the rest? Nothing.It's just got decent quality consistency in the food.  Most of the service is also of a decent quality.  The variety is quite good for the price.  With mongollian grill included, your choices are just as much as at the super buffets, but a few bucks less out of pocket.  They've got a great coupon where weekday lunch between 2-3pm is only $3.99 drink included!

Restaurant name  Come Back In

Review Text :
I never liked or disliked the Come Back In - it's a typical bar and has good beer choices.  They always offered me a chance for my band and I to play there, and exposure is always good.  However, I never liked the manager, since all he does every time is yell at his staff and glare at everyone.  He really creeps me out, the way he's always staring and crap.  Anyway, last time we were there, it was below zero outside.  We noticed a dick patron had left his yellow lab in his car with the windows all up and no blanket just to go inside and drink (people like that should never own anything that relies on them, btw) and he had been in the bar for a long time, because the windows were all nearly frosted over.  I mentioned this to the manager since he checked my ID at the door, and he said, "Who the fuck cares, it's a damned dog," and shooed me inside.  1. that is freaking RUDE to say to a CUSTOMER.  2. yes it is a dog, but that is animal cruelty.  I got a seat with my friends and kept an eye on the guy.  Sure enough, just like all other times, he yelled at his staff and glared at the customers, doing nothing else.  The cops showed up then and talked to him and he was pissed as all hell that someone (no, it wasn't me lol) called the cops to his establishment.  And yes, it was about the dog in the car in negative degree weather.  I was close enough to the situation to over hear it, and the guy was a dick to the cops too, saying things like "I don't f*cking care," and "who called you?!  Tell me!"  This guy is a real piece of work.  After the cops left, I decided I 1. never want to come here again unless it is managed by a more decent person and 2. never will accept their offer for my band to play in a place that is managed by this guy, who obviously hates his job, customers, staff and, well, life.  Until he is gone, I will never set foot in that place again.  And, as I was leaving (he was yelling at staff at that time), I told him just that.  He told me to f*ck off.  Now keep in mind I was always polite in what I was saying to him.  No customers should be treated this way.  I don't care if you don't care about the dog in the car, this review is based on how rude the guy is and how he should be told off and hopefully never comes back to work again.I've always thought that the 'Come Back In' should  be called the 'Come Back Inn'...it was a missed pun opportunity in my opinion.Anyway, I've been to the Come Back In approximately 20 times in the four or so years since I discovered it. Lots of times, I came to drink. It's a fun bar, especially when you're looking to go out in an "off" time, like a Sunday night. The place usually always has people inside, which lends a fun vibe!The food at the Come Back In is solid. I've had a few things that I haven't loved, and it's not fancy, different, or creative. However, most of the food that I've tried has been in the 3 or 4 star range...especially their breakfast! If you go for breakfast/brunch, try the Crabcakes and Asparagus Eggs Benedict. It's so rich, that I've never been able to finish them, despite their high taste coefficient. The Huevos Rancheros are really just a breakfast burrito, but they're also fab. The prices are really affordable at the Come Back In, and I think the quality of the food that you get is much better than you would expect. It's a good value, and I don't think that's true for every restaurant. Take their late night special of $3 for a burger and fries. It's a small burger, yes, but you can choose from a variety of toppings for the burger, and several different kinds of fries (Parmesan, cajun, regular). It's a fantastic deal, and nothing tastes quite as good as a burger when drunk, IMO. Even if you're not drinking, it's a good deal for a late dinner, and I think the special starts at 10:00pm. Cheaper than McDonald's, and far better. Unlike some other nearby restaurants (ahem...I'm looking at you, Great Dane), the Come Back In is a great place to go with a group. They are accommodating, respectful, more than willing to split checks, and big enough that usually there is little to no wait. Real life story: One Sunday last summer we had a group of ~10 people for brunch and El Dorado Grill next door wanted us to wait for an hour. After an hour had passed, El Dorado wanted us to wait for 30 minutes more. Instead, we walked down the road to the Come Back In and were seated immediately. We sat outside and had cheap and delicious Bloody Mary's, Mimosas, and excellent food.Perhaps my favorite thing about the Come Back Inn though, is the service. Now, the service itself isn't necessarily perfect. Sometimes the waiters can be a little rough around the edges...most are college kids, after all. They might forget to bring your drink until you remind them, or they might not know the answer to a question you have about the menu.  However the *attitude* of the majority of the staff at the Come Back In is what makes it different. Even though they screw up occasionally, they always try to make it better. One time we stopped in right before they stopped serving dinner, which was kind of a dick move on our part, but they sat us and said, "no problem! we can totally still serve you" and were cheerful and great about the whole thing. Another time, I went for dinner/drinks with a big group and the food was taking awhile to come out. The waiter arrived with several baskets of complimentary popcorn and peanuts without being asked, because he anticipated we might be getting hungry. It's refreshing not to have waiters who roll their eyes when you ask for a refill of your drink or an additional side or condiment for your meal. It happens to me in Madison more often than you'd expect, but this sort of thing has never happened to me at the Come Back In. The Come Back In is not fancy, and it's not perfect, but I really like it, and I'd pick it over many other "nicer" and more popular restaurants on the near East side any day!

Review Text :
Well, I would call this a 5 star restaurant, but I can only give it 4 stars, read on to see why...I came here with my lovely girlfriend, 2 customers and their wives. We made a reservation early and got a great table over looking the strip, right next to the windows. We had drinks (average 10$/drink) and started with the Sea Tower appetizer, which had muscles, shrimps, lobster tail and crab legs (56$).  My customers had surf and turf (46$), fish of the day (42$), lobster bisque (8$), filet mignon (42$) and NY Strip (45$). I had jumbo fried shrimp (36$) and my girlfriend had the blacked salmon (36$). A few house salads also (8$ each)... Finally, for desert, I found out it was one of my customers 24th wedding anniversary, so I had them make a special desert and write on the plate, it was very lovely (complimentary). The reason I can only give 4 stars is service. I ordered a rum and coke before we ordered the appetizer, and didn't get it till the salads came out, about 20 minutes later. Also, it took our waiter about 10 minutes to figure out who the desert was for, even though my girlfriend not only told him, but the manager to be sure. Finally, after the meal was over,  I showed the waiter my credit card under the table and got his attention, in an effort to say "Hey, I am buying". He proceeded to take the bill over to the wrong couple, showing them the 515$ tab, NOT GOOD! The dinner was on me, from my customer, and yes maybe I am 25 and they were about 45 years old average, but you DO NOT put the bill in plain view showing the total if you don't know who it goes to. I was very insulted...Needless to say, the tab, with tip, came to almost 600$, and that was definitively the most expensive meal I had ever paid for...Either way, The food was all delicious (the lobster was a bit overcooked and the muscles were on the salty side), the service was generally good (minus a few mistakes), and all the flavors were delicious. I would bring customers back here, but I would make damn sure they knew who the bill was to come to.

Review Text :
so hubby and i have never been so inspired to start up a yelp account until this very day, right after coming home from lunch at the common plea. oh and note that there is supposedly a "business casual" dress code.we were very excited to try out common plea. we had a $30 gift certificate to spend there, and we figured lunch would be a good time to try out the food fare. and if it was any good, we might go back for dinner some time. when we arrived at 12pm, it didn't look too busy, but it filled up more by the time we'd finished lunch. however, even though it wasn't terribly busy, we were led to the back of the restaurant to be seated on the back "wall" we shared with their kitchen staff. we didn't mind the noise until our fake wall started shaking from time to time. they offer bread rolls and a flatbread cracker and seasoned olive oil dip while you wait for your food. the sweet wheat roll was soft and delicious, as was the large cracker. however the other two sourdough-looking rolls were hard as rocks, thus rendering them inedible. i don't know how they taste because the crust was simply too hard to bite through.  hubby ordered the espresso crusted salmon with honey basil yogurt and mushroom rice, while i had the piattini - a set of 3 appetizers, and i picked the prosciutto wrapped shrimp, short rib sliders, and crab boursin cornet (a cone-shaped pastry stuffed with crab mixed in with boursin cheese). the espresso crusted salmon was pretty good and standard for salmon. however the espresso crust was very light. it was barely noticeable, unless you ate pieces of the salmon directly on top. it flaked well, but wasn't as tender or moist as salmon we've had elsewhere. or even the chimichurri salmon we get from trader joe's and bake at home. the rice lacked flavoring and was a bit hard when chewing through it. i expected more of a risotto-like consistency. at least it looked the part. they are quite good at plating their food. in terms of my set of 3 appetizers, i definitely enjoyed the prosciutto wrapped shrimp. basically it's lean italian bacon wrapped around large prawns. i got 2 of them along with about 2 teaspoons of a mango/red bell pepper/red onion/cilantro salsa. the salsa was good, but as long as you use fresh ingredients, it's pretty hard to screw up. my crab boursin cornet i was very excited about when i saw it on my plate. it was a little (2.5 in. long) pastry horn/cone stuffed with a ball of mixed crab with boursin cheese. the flavor was good, however i was disappointed when i discovered my pastry crust was soggy and cold. usually pastry crusts are supposed to be flaky, crispy, and hot in my experience. when i mentioned this to the waiter, and asked "is my pastry crust supposed to be soggy and cold?" he said "yes, that is how it's supposed to be". so sad. it could have been sooo much better. there was potential there. i'll give them that. then my short rib slider. was small as expected. a toasted bun with carmelized onions, mushrooms, and "short ribs". i took one bite and had to put what was in my mouth back on the plate. it was incredibly chewy, in a bad way. upon opening up my slider and examining my "short ribs", i discovered i was chewing on a piece of fat. when i attempted to dissect apart the paltry bit of meat from the fat, that proved to be impossible with a fork and knife because the actual meat on that thing was too tough to either bite or cut through sadly. hubby's attempt at my slider wasn't any better. he said it was 90% fat. and he had to agree what miniscule pieces of meat in there were extremely tough to chew on and bland. we thought about giving them one last chance with dessert. so we picked the creme brulee option. we've actually made our own creme brulee quite a bit... it's a real favorite treat for us! the crust seemed freshly torched, it was crisp and wasn't too burnt. however upon cracking the crust, hubby noticed lumps inside the creme brulee. and texture-wise, it tasted like really thick whipping cream with lumps of course, it's usually a bit more pudding-like and smoother.  it came with an almond-covered cookie thing. i was confused when i bit into it, because it tasted like a stale cookie. then hubby pointed out that it was a thin slice of white bread, with almonds and stuff baked on top. not too appetizing. it would have been so much better if they attempted almond tuilles.sadly, our meal did not go as well as planned. the presentation of the food is pleasant and appealing to the eye.  taste was just alright for hubby and 1 out of 3 appetizers for me. oh and they don't refill water for you at all throughout the meal. and be prepared to wait at least half an hour for your food and the same time for your dessert to come out even if it doesn't look busy. not planning to come back to this one any time soon.OH AND BTW...

There are some places that I order the same thing 99% of the time...and this is one of them.  I always get the 3 item combo with:Fried Rice/Chow MeinOrange ChickenSweet & Sour ChickenBeef & BroccoliThis location is solid....fresh ingredients and quick service.Will I return?  When I need a quick Chinese fix...sure.This Panda Express is located inside Vons near the produce department. I like that I can grab something to eat while getting a few items at the store. It just is convenient without having to then make another stop for food. I have to say the employees here are awesome. Well, the manager this last time was having lunch and talking with someone (maybe having a meeting?) while this girl was hustling to take care of the orders. I questioned how long something has been sitting out and she offered to make it fresh if I didn't mind waiting. Of course not! I can't believe how this girl was working so hard to take care of the customers and offering to make me fresh food while the manager laughed away in her conversation only a couple feet from me. She should have excused herself and pitched in for a moment. I took the time to tell the girl helping me that she was a hard worker and that I appreciated her service. I only wish I caught her name to give her a shout-out in this review. I like to get the 2 or 3 item combo. I always choose fried rice because I find their chow mein to have too many veggies vs. noodles and the noodles are kind of dry. The Firecracker Chicken had good flavor. It isn't very spicy but has a nice baby kick. I tried Beijing Beef and it was sweet and spicy and my favorite of all I ate.  For my 3rd item I got Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was sweet, crispy, and good. The Cream Cheese Rangoons are a nice snack on the way home and aren't greasy. If you don't want your food to go, they have tables.I don't even know how to start this review...  I ordered panda express through a delivery service called postmates. This is what showed up on my doorstep. Fried rice : So over cooked the rice was not able to be chewed because it was so hard.  The eggs in the fried rice were completely black.Spring Rolls: still frozen inside. I called panda express and the lady who answered the phone didn't speak English. I should have known never to eat panda express in the first place, but this was ridiculous.Timing is what it's all about people!!  The wife and I rarely get to eat out together and decided to go to Canton Dragon via 75th ave. The entire street, from Thomas to Indian School Rd. was closed due to a head on collision that killed 2 people we found out later. Turned around and went to Panda Express armed with 2 coupons for 2 extra free entrees. We were starving by 8pm so we opted to dine in. We got lucky and hit a lull and were able to order immediately. We ordered a little of everything from chow mein and honey shrimp ($1.25 extra) to beef and broccoli to walnut chicken. We didn't expect much flavor wise and being hungry we didn't care! The a/c thermostat must have been set on 68 degrees and after waiting to pay, finding a clean table and dodging numerous unsupervised children our food was cold. Total price for this experience was just this side of $20.00 even with coupons and no drink order. This dining experience is true testament that timing is everything! Could have been much worse! Just glad to be safely home with no suspicious abdominal gurgling!

Review Text :
I'm actually a pretty big fan of PGC. I was first treated to Mahmoud's culinary talent way back in the day (late 90's), when he owned the Green Leaf Cafe up on 19th Ave (where Fattoush is today). His current location is much nicer, but the food is still center stage. One critique that I've heard over the years is that people were expecting something different due to the name. PGC is not a Persian restaurant. It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine.The menu is quite large, with slight variances between lunch and dinner (dinner has more seafood and meat options - but honestly they let me order anything at anytime). There are always daily specials which are generally based on whatever Mahmoud finds at the daily market and items are clearly marked as Vegetarian, Vegan, or Carnivorous.My biggest challenge at PGC is narrowing down the choices to a reasonable amount of food (which isn't easy because the portions can be quite large).Some things that shine as stars on the menu:* the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan* barley soup (when it is one of the daily soups) - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley* angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx, then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient*purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant, topped with sautéed onions, garlic, scallion, tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon juice and feta cheese*herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one, but it truly rocks!Most of the meals are served with brown and white basmati rice topped with a toasted almond-raisin-saffron mix, a homemade cugurt sauce and fresh nan. I could probably make a meal on this stuff alone.PGC has a small selection of wines, but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them. The peach tea is like none other that I have ever tried!The only thing that I'm not a big fan of are the deserts - with the exception of the ginger and rose petal ice cream. If I'm going to splurge calories on desert, it's not going to be on a Vegan Cheesecake. But that ice cream... my mom and I split one and the first bite I took was weird and wonderful all at the same time - by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl we were having a spoon fight that required black-belt finger moves.This is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles. It's not cheap, but they definitely make up for it in quality and large portions. Call ahead to check the schedule if you are interested in going on a night when they have belly dancing (usually the only time you need a reservation).I have been driving by this place for over 5+ years and never bothered to try it; Except yesterday. I came to find out that I would have went on with my life by never going there and not missing much.I came here for lunch with my co-workers so they could try Persian food. When we arrived, it was pretty dead. We were seated and handed the menus...as I was looking, I was expecting Cholo Kabab, Ghormeh Sabzi, Gheimeh, etc...instead I found TOFU, GRILLED CHEESE, and everything else that was not Iranian!  I am pretty certain tofu doesnt even exist in Iran. They did have doogh (Iranian yogurt drink), so that was good. I was so disappointed. We got the hummus and it was lacking flavor and was super runny. The bread, which the waitress called NAAN (it's called noon) but it wasn't naan or noon or pita bread..I don't know what it was. I do know it wasn't good. One of my coworkers go the chicken kabob plate, I got the shish kabob plate with half rice and half shirazi salad, and my other co worker got the BZ (or DZ) stew. My kabobs were chewy, my salad was overly sour and had too much dried mint, and the rice tasted old. My coworker didn't really like his stew either. The service was extreeeeeemely slow. One of the girls brought the wrong food to our table...mind you, there was only 2 tables. And the prices are pretty up there for bad food. I won't be going back.

Restaurant name  Dish

Review Text :
Allow me to go ahead and dish on Dish. Dish is indeed A-OK in my book. With kitschy decor, down home grub and solid service, Dish is a solid choice for an affordable and tasty fare in Plaza Midwood. Hubs and I rolled into Dish after three failed attempts at other local restaurants on a Saturday evening. I was not in the mindset to wait an HOUR for a table, so Dish is where we landed!We grabbed an affordable drink at the bar and waited about 10 minutes for our table - that's a score at 8 pm on a Saturday night. The menu is filled with a variety of options ranging from Fried Green Tomatoes, to Pot Roast, to Shrimp and Grits. While it's definitely not a low cal location, Dish has a variety of dishes that will please just about any palate. Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions for both appetizer and main course. We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes. Overall, not a bad dish. Small fried greenies with a tangy dill dipping sauce. I was hoping for more flavor in the breading - from what I could tell it was just flour and egg...no pepper, no additional spices, etc. About 15 minutes later I dug into my Chicken & Dumplings - a moderate and well priced portion of the milky soup stuffed with long bits of shredded chicken and hearty dumplings. It was well made and hearty - but again, it was lacking flavor. Boatloads of pepper were added. For my side, I chose the sweet potato mash which was indeed sweet - almost too sweet for my liking! And that's saying quite a bit. The gratis honey biscuit and deviled egg really were stars of the meal, though! The biscuit came out warm with a honey glaze...I promptly devoured my biscuit in 30 seconds flat. YUM. The deviled egg was super fresh and perfectly crafted. So, while Dish wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had it was comforting, solid and very affordable. If I find myself in a pinch next time I'm in PM, Dish is on my short list.** Pimento Cheese on Pita Bread Points Appetizer. 5/5.Requested Cold. Housemade with diced pimento and pickled jalapenos. SUPERB! The best thing that I ate all night. They should market this stuff. It is what "I" would make IF "I" went to the effort of grinding sharp cheddar cheese through a meat grinder. Their pimento cheese was so good when we had our company Christmas lunch at Dish, that we almost fought over the stuff. It was equally as good tonight. Good Job! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=zC0ICeQYyG--Ls2EXaWjCwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=l6RMXmTzpIS9pZSj15ZVAQ** Pot Roast: 3/5.Okay, tasty, a little fatty. I was expecting a larger portion for $13.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=Orr6SwW8k09q8D2UehE2Fw** Mashed Potatoes w/Gravy. 3.5/5.They left the skin on, which I like. This paired well the meat, but I would like to be able to choose my own sides, thank you. ** Collard Greens. 4/5.Good, sweet, rustic. Well done. The pot likker was delicious, but I didn't stumble across any pieces of ham hocks. (Can one be a collard green snob? Maybe, I am. LOL)** Biscuit. 3/5. Who puts honey on the "outside" of a biscuit? It just makes the darned thing sticky and messy. Everyone knows, well not the people at Dish - but everyone else, knows that butter and honey go on the INSIDE of a biscuit. You're welcome.** Deviled Egg. 1/5.A pitiful example of one of my favorite egg dishes. Cold and lacking in any taste whatsoever. No love or attention was put into this food item. Lowe's Supermarket has MUCH better deviled eggs in their deli. My mother made better deviled eggs.....and so do I, there's no comparison. ** Bloody Mary. 3/5.Tasty and spicy, but the glass was about 80% ice to monetize the drink. Those Bastids. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=UAq8RfqQUtrvA_1AH-KPRA** Service? 1/5. (see below)The maitre'd gave me lip about wanting to sit at a booth, in a basically empty (5 p.m.) restaurant - not a good start. If I'm paying $30+ dollars for a meal, I sit where I like, thank you. I had a passive/aggressive waitress that I damn near wanted to strangle by evening's end. She didn't tell me the specials, because she probably didn't know what they were. Another blue haired hipster waitress at an adjacent table didn't know what they were either, when a foursome of diners asked - and THAT waitress was far better than the one that I endured. My waitress actually gave me grief about not ordering dessert, when I had already had an appetizer, a mixed drink, and an entree. She gave me grief about bringing a to go box for the remains of my pimento cheese app. What REALLY ticked me off was when I was ready to leave. Said waitress took my credit card......and then she didn't return for what seemed an eternity. When I looked around, she was taking other people's orders, wrapping silverware, busing tables, delivering to go boxes, etc., with no apparent hurry to bring back my ticket to sign....so I could get the heck out of Dodge. She seemed to be trying to do everything at once, which resulted in her doing everything haphazardly. After a good fifteen to twenty minutes of waiting, I was ready to YELL from frustration. No, seriously, I almost lost it. A nice meal was basically ruined by a disorganized waitress. In summary: The food is good. Some food items are priced a little too high. The pot roast was $13, which was effing ridiculous considering the portion was not "that" large. (I think that they charged me for the entire cut of roast.) The service pretty much sucks. The acoustics are terribly LOUD when the restaurant if full. All of the waitstaff are wannabe hipsters. Parking is difficult. I have no intention of going back again anytime soon, unless someone else wants to go there. I should have went to Baoding or Bistro La Bon or Midwood Smokehouse or Good Food on Montford. {sigh} Maybe, next time.

Review Text :
I'm a fan of superheroes: comics, movies, you name it. Typically, you'lll find me in a big debate on superhero powers: invisibility vs. flying. Tonight, I longed for bionic arteries that could withstand daily dosages of Penguin's delectable greasy food. Penguins is an "establishment." Landmark restaurant, arguably in a historic location, complete with the tiniest, antiquated porcelain drinking fountain , fit only for pygmies, out front. It feels more like a bar than a restaurant inside. Lots of wood on the walls and bar, a jukebox blaring David Bowie, Foo Fighters and some hairbands. The burgers are straightforward and delicious. Soft, moist bun, lettuce, tomato and a hand-shaped burger patty, that tastes like the heralded In-N-Out burger on crack. The Ribeye Sandwich is surprisingly delicious. Horseradish mayo compliments the tender beef, a messy mass of perfection. The stars of the show are their generously portioned, translucent tissue paper inducing, greasy sides. We ordered sweet potato fries and thin onion strings. The sweet potato fries, when dipped into honey mustard sauce are addictive. Although not super crisp or battered, the sweet potato flavor rings through. The onion strings were lightly battered, sweet and tasty. They are the kind that are just oniony enough to satisfy, but not too oniony where you'd run for some mouthwash right after.  I seriously could imagine me pounding both down after a night of drinking. Speaking of which, beers: $2 domestics, $3.50 imports. Not bad. Rarely will I take leftover fried food to go, but I took a box home tonight. Hoping somehow the oven will revive the amazing cravability factor of my onion rings and sweet potato fries. 3 beers, 2 entrees, 2 sides (lots leftover) $24.The wait was over an hour, and the staff was rude! The food was bland, everything needed salt. The fries were cold, and the burgers were small. I went with a family of 5 and tried a bit of everyone's food and was not impressed. I asked for the waiter to put my grilled cheese on texas toast rather than the pita, and he said no. BUT both grilled cheese and texas toast is on the menu! Rude. Do NOT go here. It is not worth it. There are only 10 tables, this place is not good for large groups of people OR children. It is loud and the kids will not enjoy the environment.In P/M this diner was born and raisedThe Penguin was where we spent most of our daysThe Burgers, Pickles, Dogs all coolAll drinkin' some pitchers up on a barstoolWhen a family of peepsWho were up to no goodStarted makin' trouble in our neighborhoodThey got greedy for cash and in a scandalous moveStole the place from the owners, don't no one approve.We pulled up to the place - it's in such a weird stateAll emptied and closed, gettin' coats of new paintWe looked to the sign, It was still up thereYet another sad victim of corporate warfare.I don't plan to go back to the schmucky new Penguin. My business will follow the delightful original owners to their new location, the Diamond.so apparently this isn't the one it was anymore.  sad.  The place I went to has now since closed, and is now run by other people and the food is so different now. BOO!Also - don't fake like you were the ones on Triple D.  That's just sad.Since my previous review about the new corporate version of this once loved establishment was flagged and removed i'll try again. It was removed  "because it does not contain a new firsthand experience with the business." Now why they think it wasn't based off of an experience is beyond me. (mind readers maybe??) Anyways, this is not the "Original Penguin" that gained all the acclaim. Notice the "TM" after the name now. It is a lame, shell of a version of the restaurant that once lived. Wait staff was inattentive, food was greasy, I don't expect it to last long. If you are looking for food inspired by the original Penguin, try Pinkys Westside, or The Diamond. Corporate entity's have no business swallowing up a local legend, and demanding the same respect of the community, please support local business.I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted a one hour trip! I didn't know this place had new ownership, as soon as we looked at the menu we knew something wasn't right cause it was all different but the worse thing is they don't carry the Best Ever Banana Pudding! Their onion rings for an appetizer was the size of a side order & it was just onion rings with no "onion"! We sat at the bar & kept seeing waitresses bring food back cause it was cold. Like a lot of places the prices went up & less food!  I will never waste my time coming here again!I love how the new ownership is trying to flag bad reviews for removal. What's the point of a review site if people can't share their honest opinion?The Penguin is NOT what it used to be. It completely lacks the original atmosphere, and the food quality has slipped as well. This place used to serve the best burger in Charlotte and we would take friends there just for the burgers- but the one I had on my first (and last!) visit since it reopened was a complete let-down: dry and overcooked. We ordered fries to split, but the portion was smaller than before and came out cold. Worse yet, no hush puppies! I'm one of those people that identifies an establishment by the one thing they do best, be it breakfast, pasta, chicken, whatever- thinking about the Penguin always made me hungry for a Block Burger with hush puppies. We will not be going back. Time to find a new "best burger." :(I'll admit at the outset that I was a regular fan of the Penguin's previous incarnation.  For the long and short of it - the new one feels like Applebees does the Penguin.  The food is still generally good, but the menu is much more limited in scope.  Gone are the interesting sandwiches like the grilled peanut butter and banana or the tuna melt.  There are still burgers and dogs, and they remain good.  There are still a significant number of veggie options, including versions of the dog and burger.  There are salads for those seeking healthy food at the Penguin.My partner got a veggie dog with pimiento cheese and fried pickles on top.  He liked it quite a bit.  I got a small burger and dog--both southern style (chili, slaw, mustard, 86 the onions) and both good.  I also got fries, and they were crisp and hot.What has changed is that it no longer feels a part of the neighborhood.  The waitresses are all perky and friendly, but there isn't a tattoo to be found anywhere.  The music throughout our visit was soft hits of the 80s.  There are lots of t-shirts and merchandise that tout the long history of the Penguin, but also feel alien to it.  They look more like they would be sold on the boardwalk in Carolina Beach.  I don't know whether there will eventually be more of a sense of community in the new Penguin.  Perhaps with time the staff will get to know regulars and it will feel more authentic.  Until then, the food is OK, and it is clean and safe.  It is also MUCH easier to get a table now, but you can take that to mean what you like.I was in Charlotte yesterday and was awfully excited at the prospect of stopping by my old fav, "The Penguin" for lunch. This was the coolest, most iconic restaurant/diner in Charlotte--the place where I would tell people visiting from out-of-town that they "had to visit!" Now, not so much.The atmosphere was gone, the people (regular patrons/employees) were gone; the fried pickles were so-so, the cheese fries were not the legendary ones I remember, the hushpuppies were gone, and the black-bean veggie burger was some dried out piece-o-crap vs. the delicious runny mess that I longed for. What the hell happened? I came home and did some research on the Internet and apparently the former owners got the boot last October and the current owners are trying to franchise this once legendary establishment. Shame on you for turning the best diner experience EVER into some "Applebee-esque" nightmare.Folks, this isn't the same restaurant you've seen on Food Network and Travel Channel. In a nutshell, The Penguin was opened in 1954 by a man I'll call "Mr B". Around 10 years ago, two guys - Brian and Jimmy - took over the restaurant from Mr B, who has since died. Brian and Jimmy hired Greg to be head chef, and the "new" Penguin was a smash hit. However, when Brian and Jimmy's lease was up for renewal, Mr B's family decided to kick them out and hire Martin Sprock to turn it into a franchise.But how's the food? Sadly, a shadow of its former self. The fried pickles, once the star of the show, are greasy and soggy, and not nearly as good as before. I ordered the "Freak Flag Fly", a burger with queso, bacon and slaw, and was bitterly disappointed. The meat was dry and overdone, and flavor was... lacking. My fries were way too cool (almost cold) and lacked salt. My GF's onion rings were entirely too "bready", not like the delicious ones I remember from before. For the record, the new menu is actually larger than the previous menu. But one wonders why they should have a bigger menu if they can't even get basics like fries and rings right. And I also wonder why it took so long to get our food when there were only three other occupied tables at 7PM on a Thursday night.What's worse is that the ambiance is totally gone. It's still the same building, but the servers lack tattoos. The jukebox, once one of the most eclectic in Charlotte, is now Top 40. They even sell souvenirs now! It's like a Disney-fied version of the restaurant I once knew and loved! If you want to have the same food that made the Penguin such a success in the first place, try The Diamond next door (Brian and Jimmy's new place) or Pinky's Westside (Greg's new place). Both are delicious and authentic. The "new" Penguin is neither.I could just put a sad face here, and leave it at that, but then you wouldn't know the excruciating time we had at this place. Wow. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and I don't give one star reviews lightly!! After hearing how great this place was over and over and over, and that it was on Diners, drive Ins and dives I HAD to go. I'm a sucker for that sorta thing, and man did this place miss the mark. I can honestly say unless they make some serious changes I may never go back or give it a second glance. Parking was an adventure at this place.. the only spots open were close to a curb, so I decided to take my SUV and pretend it was a Jeep Wrangler. I got so frustrated trying to find a place to park on an empty stomach that I seriously just baja'd over the curb and bounced into the small spot that was waiting. When we came in, I was excited about this place. It had that old divey dinerish feel that I love and I figured there was NO way this place could be a miss. We got the menu and I thought everything sounded amazing! I ended up opting to make my own burger. Egg, mozzarella cheese & mayo. Pretty simple right? Well not for our server, she was apparently still drunk from her binge the night before. I know this because she told us, in her half arsed attempt of an apology. Sigh. I'll get there, don't you worry. I got my burger with fries. I'd asked for onion rings.... That wasn't that big of a deal, but it was only the beginning to the train wreck that was coming. The burger looked fantastic, and I couldn't wait to try it! Well I took that first bite and there was a taste I wasn't expecting... ONIONS. Really? So you forget the onion rings but you apparently added them to my burger, and went sans mayo. Good thing I like onions I guess. I just ate the burger and didn't say anything at first. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ sandwich with the sauce on the side and no coleslaw. She brings him the BBQ with no sauce, and coleslaw slathered on the top of it. He has to remind her that he asked for no coleslaw and the sauce on the side. She brings him two types of sauce to try and the sweeter of the two is a mustard based. How do I know this? Because she mixed the mustard in and a fat layer of yellow was on top the the smokey red. She didn't even mix it up or anything. Normally I'm not this picky of a person, but with every single thing that happened, I had enough. We asked her for a box twice, and took home the leftovers. She did apologize about her screw ups, and said, "I'm so sorry, I think I'm still half drunk. I'll give you a free dessert." I almost didn't get the dessert because by this point I had better things to do than spend any more of my time at the penguin. But she said banana pudding and I thought maybe that would bring them back up a star. She brought it over, I took a few bites and I just wasn't impressed. When we got home my stomach was all torn up, and I ended up throwing away the left overs. I didn't want to feel that way two days in a row. UGH. Sorry for the long winded review, but I warned you. My take on this place: :( Save your money, and keep the experience of what you saw on TV in your heart. This place is sure to disappoint.

Review Text :
I had a Groupon for the Florida Cafe that was going to expire in a few days so I went here last night to use it and I'm glad I did.  My server was a delightful young woman but we had a bit of a language problem as you'll see during my review.I looked over the menu and I also asked her suggestion.  She pointed to an oxtail stew that's not on their online menu.  I opted to take her advice.  I started with their papas rellenas--mashed potatoes stuffed with picadillo beef and deep fried.  Presentation was very nice with two very thin plantain pieces deep freid and stuck in the papas.  There was also a small salad.The menu said all dinners come with red or black beans and rice.  I specified black beans.  That was the first language mixup.  Not only did I get black beans with my meal but my server brought me an extra bowl of black beans because she thought I ordered an extra dish.  It was good so I ate both!The oxtail stew was very flavorful.  I think some people might have thought the broth was salty, but it was just great for me.Dessert order time.  I asked about the size of the tres leches cake tower with flan and coconut.  She assured me it wasn't that large and then she brought me the normal flan and not the tres leches cake.  Language problem number 2.She asked if I wanted more Coke and I said, "No, iced tea."  She then brought me a Coke.  I didn't notice, but I soon had a table side science experiment.  You have no idea how Coke foams when you put artificial sweetener in it.  I managed to keep little Vesuvius from flooding the table, but I didn't drink the Coke.  Last language error.I'm going to go back because I really like Cuban food.  I'll also make sure that what I want is a bit more explicit!I've been here years ago, but for some reason haven't been back. A few friends suggested coming here as they haven't been in a long time as well and a few in our party never been. We shared appetizers of - Jamon Croquettas - so think of if ham were fish sticks, then that would be this. Interesting, but I wouldn't get it again. Chicarones - these were served warm and were nicely crunchy. Solid chicaron. And they serve you white bread rolls slathered in butter. The BF and I shared - Cuban Sandwich with fries - This was a decent sandwich, but not the best I've had. Get it with the plaintain chips if you're into them as someone in our party got those and I thought that was better as the fries are standard. Pernil de Cerdo Asado - the pork was pretty tender and the red beans were pretty good. I feel it was missing something like a sauce though. I order something similar in LA and it's in a mojo sauce and I could have sworn eons ago when I was here last my meat was more citrusy. Service was just OK. Sometimes it seemed like they didn't really care and seemed to mishear us a lot. "Okay, french fries" "No, chicarones." "Oh okay". "Chuletas de Cerdo" "No, Pernil de Cerdo" "Oh'. Someone got black beans instead of what they actually ordered. It's a unique place with some charm. I feel it was slightly better years ago when we used to go. I remember really loving the pork back then, but I didn't feel the love as much now. I would probably eat here again when there is a hankering, but it sits right in the middle of the road for me.

Review Text :
They've really got their shiz together!  I can't complain about a single thing!  The service was A+.  Completely attentive and extremely friendly.  Food was excellent!  I hadn't been to Pipers in a while so I felt like I needed another visit to properly review the place.  I got super excited about going there when I tried their Guinness Stew at an event last week so I was set on ordering that because it was so delicious, even in a buffet style!  But then at the last minute changed my mind, being tempted by the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie.  It was so savory!  The Scottish Ale gravy was so thick and tasty and those crispy potatoes on top?  It was like icing on top of a delicious cake!  I am NOT one to forget about the sweet things in life, but this was such a hearty meal that there was no way I could have eaten dessert after such a hearty meal.  Now I can't wait to go back and sample some more delicious meals and have a nice English ale to boot!I can see why 50 other folks love this place! Quite the find. Wholesome, hearty, beefy, Brit-inspired fare. This is rib-stickin' food, my friends. Fries on salads, scotch eggs, proper English AND Irish brekkies served anytime, Guinness stew, shepherd's and their pies, chicken & mushroom pastry...and, a VEGAN BLACK BURGER. Yes, the geniuses behind Piper's Pub though of just about everyone, even the vegans. Well done, well done. Also, a whole mess of sandwiches, etc. Yes, the food is excellent enough to stand on its own, but what truly makes this place shine is the service. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly, equipped with a wifi password (he saw me checking my phone, checking in of course!) without even asking, plus a story to boot (ask the owner about "Yo Pipes!"). Waters and hot teas arrived swiftly as did menus. Our lunching partners joined us, we all ordered and from start to finish the service was utterly flawless. We had no less than 3 gentlemen taking orders, delivering food, refilling waters, checking on our happiness, etc. All just seemed to totally have their shit together and like being alive. This is rarity in the biz, these guys got it. This place has roots, and one of them seems to be treating guests like proper guestsAnd making them wish they'd worn stretchy pants. On a last second whim, I went with the full English Breakfast. Baked beans, bangers (sausages), 2 eggs over easy and thick cut toast all heaped onto a plate. It arrived in all of its glory, HOT, delicious and exactly what I wanted. It kept me full for approximately 9 hours (the entire drive to NYC) and I consumed about 1/4 of it. This stuff is for REAL. I'd say you might want to think about sharing plates due to the huge portions, but the food is so darned good I just recommend ordering your own and taking home leftovers. It's worth it. The lunch hour was a comfortable busy and I left with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Yes, I was full...but really, Piper's is the bomb. Yo Pipes! Indeed. HUGE lunch for 4, no booze + tip: $60.Have you ever read the book (or seen the film) "Alive"? You know, where the rugby team crashes in the Andes, and while freezing to death, they are forced to eat their dead in order to survive?Well, I think that rugby team should probably have just brought along Piper's Pub's Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie. Because it is the absolute perfect winter meal, and then they could've avoided that whole cannibalism thing. For only about $10 at Piper's, you'll get a huge, hearty serving of the most rich, flavorful, lamb stew you've ever had, topped with crispy potatoes, and filled with even more. This one delicious, piping-hot bowl will sustain you for days. If you eat the whole thing, I promise you won't even have any room left for the guy who was sitting in 7C.This place is always packed on a Friday or Saturday night (I've been given 2+ hour wait times on multiple occasions), but it's not very hard to see why.  The business which makes it difficult for a group is caused by the things that make it so attractive to a group.First, it's simply a nice place to hang out.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable (if a bit slow sometimes); the decor is nice and on-theme; and the crowd is a far cry more mature and diverse than what comes to mind when you mention "South Side Bar" to your average Pittsburgher.Second, the food isn't just your usual bar food.  That fare is available, but they also have a lot of options from across the pond--Scottish and British specialties, many with a North American accent.  Not every item on their extensive menu is a winner, but once you figure out what you like, you'll get far more hits than misses.Third, if you're a fan of single malt Scotch whiskies, this is easily one of the best bars in the county to explore the category.  The entire whisky list is great, but the offerings from Scotland are without equal (at least among all the bars I've been to or heard about in and near Pittsburgh--the selection is also bigger than that of any single liquor store I've been to in the state).So check out Piper's, but please, not all at once and preferably not when I'm going there.  It's too crowded already.  Don't make me regret this review.Piper's has been on my to-visit list forever, and I finally received the chance to check it out this past Sat. for dinner at 6:30pm.  I came for a double date with CM and some friends of mine who've been to Scotland, so I was very interested in their thoughts on the authenticity of the offerings.  Given the great things I'd heard about Piper's, it didn't disappoint--a good time was had by all, and all of us left well satiated!For our appetizer, CM and I ordered the Ploughman's platter, which consisted of an apple-cherry chutney, two types of cheese, apple slices, gherkin pickles, and baguettes ($13).  This platter contained more than enough food for all four of us to share, and was a nice accompaniment to our entrees and drinks.  I say entrees because, due to an oversight on my part, we ordered the platter slightly after our entrees, so it came out at the same time as everything else, rather than beforehand.  I can't fault the waitstaff or kitchen for this, however, since the ordering error was mine!  Our friends ordered a whisky flight of the single malt basics ($12), which they enjoyed sampling, even if they didn't enjoy every whisky comprising it.  (One of them commented that the smokiest whisky, the Laphroaig, tasted like drinking a campfire!)  Interestingly, they mentioned that the lighter whiskys tasted different after having sampled the smokier ones, adding interest to the sampling.For our entrees, we all ordered from the "across the pond" section of the menu.  Three of us ordered variations on the shepherd's pie (chicken shepherd's pie, $12; chicken mushroom cottage pie, $12; lamb and smoked chestnut, $12), and the other one ordered the bangers and mash ($12).  All of us enjoyed our entrees very much.  Because we didn't share entrees, I can only describe my own--the chicken shepherd's pie--firsthand.  Despite a somewhat visually unappealing presentation, the flavors were savory, comforting, and filling--exactly what I'd hoped for in a shepherd's pie.  According to our waitress, the filling of the cottage pie was exactly the same as mine; the only thing that differed was the topping (potatoes for the shepherd's pie vs. puff pastry for the cottage pie).  If I ordered this item again, I think I'd go with the puff pastry due to the greater visual appeal and added textural interest.  One minor criticism was that we felt that less meat than we expected was included.  As for CM, he enjoyed the bangers and mash, commenting that both the sausages and potatoes were delicious and filling--though I found the presentation of this dish a bit strange.In line with my expectations, service from our waitress was responsive when needed, but unobtrusive when unnecessary.  The ambiance was appropriate for a UK pub, though I found the table configuration a bit awkward.  (We were seated at the high top closest to the host stand, which wouldn't have been my first choice, but it was busy, and that's what opened up when we came up on the list.)  Also, it was a bit on the loud side--though we didn't have any trouble hearing one another at the table.  The wait was about 20 min.--not too bad, considering we came during prime dinner hour on a Sat.  Then again, this is a pub, so I imagine it becomes increasingly crowded as the night wears on.Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience at Pipers's Pub, and would definitely be willing to return in the future.  CM's and my total check came to $27 with a $10 City Dining card discount, and we felt the prices were fair for the quality and amount of food received.  If you need a break from the normal Carson St. bar scene and would like to experience a UK-style pub with quality eats, check Piper's out!

Review Text :
Lately, we've been doing a good amount of takeout from Saigon Palace. It's very close to home, they never screw up the order and the Pho is flipping fantastic. I get the Pho Ga which is simply chicken soup and my wife has been enjoying the Pho Chay (a vegetarian soup).The takeout is well organized with separate containers for the broth and for the noodles. And another separate container for the bean sprouts, limes, hot peppers and fresh basil leaves.I don't know about the other foods they offer. The last time I had the Chinese, it was just meh. But the pho? It's PHO-bulous.

Restaurant name  Takara Japanese Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Takara is the best Japanese/Sushi restaurant in Madison easily! If your looking for great sushi at a reasonable price go for the Takara Lunch Special. For two rolls and either soup/salad it is only $9.50 and for three rolls and either soup/salad it is only $12.25, you can not get a whole lot better than that. The spicy California roll is by far the best roll available. I have tried getting spicy California rolls at other restaurants since trying theirs and I have never found something that comes even close to Takaras. Takara is also a great place to go for Hibachi. I love sitting around the table while the food is cooked in front of us. It is great for special occasions whether you are on a date or with a group of friends for a birthday.

Restaurant name  Alzohour Market
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
There ( almost ) is no need to hop the Marrakech Express since we have Alzohour Market right here in Phoenix. Islamic clothing , groceries and other items are sold here but there also is a very modest small Moroccan Restaurant and Bakery here. The food we tried was delicious. Service was VERY pleasant but terribly slow. I think it took them a half hour to bring our beverages. Only one  other small table was in the restaurant and our meal was a two hour stay so that should be noted. I also noticed that table of four people had each plate delivered to them one by one and NOT TOGETHER! I think it might be very hectic for them to serve more than two tables at a time.We shared the B'Stilla. It's a Moroccan Appetizer. It's a very large House Made Phyllo Pastry stuffed with shredded chicken, almonds, and cinnamon. It very delicious and certainly unique. It really feeds four or more people but we wanted to try it.Then we shared another Moroccan dish the Fish Tangine. It was Cod on a sizzling skillet in a Tomato based sauce with onions ,  bell peppers , preserved lemons and exotic spices. It was very fragrant and spicy! They gave us side salads and a big plate of fluffy long grain rice to share.You can get Moroccan without the hassle of going to Marrakech. This building is Halal that means no pork is in the building and a big wall of A Grade Maricopa inspection reports are posted on the window.

Review Text :
Came here on a date (which sucked BTW)  but onto the food. Great atmosphere and friendly fast workers. The food is yummo however if you're into spicy spicy this isn't the place. Overall I'm giving it a 5. I recommend itI will never spend another dollar at this establishment after how I was treated today. I located Thai Basil's menu online to order dinner. I called the number on their website and a man answered. I told him I wanted to place an order for delivery. He asked me my address, which is about two miles from the restaurant. I placed my order and he told me it would arrive in 15 minutes to one hour. I waited an hour and when my food still hadn't arrived, I called the restaurant. The man I spoke to earlier said the delivery person was out sick and it would be an additional 30-40 minutes; their delivery was very slow. I asked why he hadn't told me about that earlier--I would have ordered carrypit otherwise--and he proceeded to yell at me and hang up. I called back again and he hung up on me again after proclaiming that the store was too busy and he had no time to talk to me. I then drove to the restaurant; the owner claimed it was extremely busy (it wasn't) and said that the delivery person hadn't even showed up to work until 5:30pm. I reminded him that he told me the delivery person was out sick and he denied it, claiming I called before the delivery person arrived. I showed him on my cell phone where I called to place my order at 6:31pm. The owner screamed at me, put his hand in my face, and refused to give me my food. I demanded my order and he eventually gave me my food, prepared the wrong way and stone cold. I will not tolerated being disrespected and lied to, especially by an establishment I *choose* to patronize. I'd give this place zero stars if I could.

Restaurant name  Calabria Italian Kitchen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Calabria is exactly what you are looking for if you are looking for an Italian deli like you would find on the East Coast. You can get sliced meats, sandwiches, salads, fresh pastas and various random grocery items. It's the kind of deli that makes you feel warm and cozy inside. You can eat inside, out back, or take it to go. They even offer breakfast now! No, its not a grocery store or a convenience store, it's a deli. And for me it's the best one in town. The Caprese sandwich is top notch, so are the Italian, Sicilian, and Panino. The Panino and Italian might be the best sandwiches in all of Phoenix (depending on how much meat you want that day...) I don't think you can find anything quite like theirs anywhere else. (Including that place up the road...) I like it because of the diverse menu with options. I like it for the wonderful mozzarella they have. I like it because they carry Snapple. I won't lie...I also like it because the owners are from Boston and we always chat about the Sox when I stop in. It's a great place to stop for lunch or if you don't feel like making dinner.

Restaurant name  Fuel & Fuddle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The current 3.5 star rating of Fuel & Fiddle is really fair.  I think it is three star if you go during normal hours and four stars if you go for the late night food specials.There are so many different beers and whiskeys to choose from here, and I was impressed.  I didn't order anything this trip, but I would definitely consider coming here for late night pizza and whiskey.Let me start by saying that the menu is massive.  Anyone can find something to eat here.  My friend and I split the Bada Bing ($10) and On the Lamb pizza ($10).  The Bada Bing was a grilled Italian sausage sandwich with sweet peppers, onions, marinara & provolone.  The sandwich was OK, but it was a bit dry.  The pizza had gyro-style lamb and provolone cheese, and was topped with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber dill sauce.  It was super unique, but I enjoyed it.  The food was pretty standard and nothing to write home about.I would come back for the late night $5 pizza special and to drink, but I don't think I would stop back in just for dinner.  The atmosphere is fairly loud, if that deters you.

Review Text :
During my recent trip to Vegas I figure I'll steer off the usual path and see what the locals truly enjoy here... Looked up online and found Food Express and decided to give it a go...Despite the fact that I've already had an early dinner, I was craving some salt and pepper pork chops so that was my target all along!  Well... gotta say that their S&P pork chop was pretty good... but since I'm from LA, I guess I've had similar quality?  But nevertheless it was made pretty tasty.I wanted to try other dishes so there will most likely be a future review from my next trip...  Thus hopefully increasing the star rating at least one star higher...If the food is good, you may ask why I gave it a 3 stars?  To me... if a customer gives you a bill to break for your bill even though it's not much of a change, you should always give back the change and let the customer decide what to do with the rest of the money... well, the guy hands me my food and said thank you....  I was going to give him the tip anyway but I didn't understand why he didn't place it in the tray and let me make that decision.... why does he have to make that decision for me?  Yes... I'm Asian, but I definitely would never do that because the change is still "not my money until given"  So that irked me quite a bit even if it's a little bit of chump change...Hopefully my next visit all the food will be fanstastic and that they will actually give me my change back.... if not, I'm gonna once again raise hell on yelp about it for sure!Don't mind my rant.... enjoy your hot and crispy pork chops!My experience here wasn't as great as I thought it would be based on the number of average stars Food Express has for the number of reviews.  We had a language problem a couple of times last night.I ordered the moo shu pork for an appetizer for the two of us and chicken with green beans for a main course, also to be shared.  The moo shu was brought out in a relatively quick time.  There were four plump pancakes filled with goodness.  It appears that Food Express used the tortilla like wrappers instead of the thinner, traditional pancakes.  The rolls were flavorful but before we even had one eaten, the server was back with our main course.  I hate that so much.When the chicken arrived, it was not chicken with green beans but chicken with broccoli.  That was a language problem or simply an error on the server's part.  We took the meal.  I wouldn't waste that food for one vegetable.When we were finished, I asked if there was a dessert menu.  The server mumbled something, pointed to the kitchen, and then left the table.  A few minutes later, he came back with two small bowls of warmed, sweetened red bean soup which was our dessert I guess but he never said anything more.My wife didn't care for her dessert so I finished two.  I'm glad it was small.There are many things on the menu I'd love to try but I'm a little gun shy.  I'm not sure I'll be back.  Spring Mountain Road, I think I'll go your direction next time.

Walking in expecting to see a hostess or something, we kind of just meandered in and found a table. The backless stools looked brand new yet still fit with the old world pub feel. We were greeted by the barkeep who came out to take our orders. We had one menu to look at to make our selections. Small but sufficient bar food menu and a decent jumbled listing of beers. They were all written in one run on sentence like paragraph using commas to separate them so i really couldn't say how many drafts they had. i know i had Big Boss Blanco Diablo and a $3 Guinness. Thursday is $3 pint night for all drafts i believe, but everyday is $3 Guinness day.i went with the buffalo chicken sandwich which apparently comes with a super sized  extra large amount of fries. Plain old fries that could use some love from a seasoning salt of some sort. The buffalo was decent and the chicken was a hearty portion.Overall, i liked our service and meal. Can't say i'd recommend coming solely for the meal, unless you come armed with the Entertainment coupon then it is definitely worth trying (bogo entree) or if you are longing for an authentic pub feel and are going to have some drinks. (i've never been to a real pub, but it seems authentic), i imagine we'll venture back if for nothing else to use the 2011 Entertainment Book coupon.

It's nitty, it's gritty, the food is AWESOME and the clientile & staff is straight hood! It's in the middle of the REAL south side of Phoenix right off of Central & Baseline. It's crazy awesome. At first glance ifs pretty colorful and kind of cool, if it were wiped down with rags dampened with clorox! LOL! This is TOTALLY my kind of place!! Its straight hood! It's in a strip mall and is between a Chinese food place and a day labor place. It's kind of crazy there. If you're dining after dark I FULLY recommend ordering things to go because there's been shootings there before. Two that I know of, but YO she shouldn't have looked at her like that! GAH! JK! There are a few retro video games there and a couple of pool tables and there's also a bar in the back! (yay!!) but the bar scene isn't that great. But the booze is cheap! (double yay!)Like all Long Wongs, this place is known for their hot wings which are made fast, cheap & delicious! their suicide wings are the owner's pride and joy and trust me... they're HOTT!! I once downed an entire pitcher of Margaritas while scarfing on a dozen trying to win a bet. And at the end of the night, I prevailed while holding my head up HIGH before I crashed down to the floor cuz I was trashed! They have the usual greasy spoon food and it's all at fair prices. They also have bbq and solid dinners. Like speghetti or steak dinners. I'm a huge fan of their fried zucchini. This place is very rough around the edges but it's still the small neighboor place that it was intended to be. Where those in know which side of the menu to order from. Where drunks get trashed in the back room bar. Where hustlers get gullable rez girls (like me) to bet them $20 a ball at some 8ball. where sometimes fights break out - but it's not a terrible thing. I don't know how to explain it... Its home. It's rough, it's the hood but the people are real. There is NO pretention in this place. It's straight up good food at straight up good prices. You can have a great time here - I have had many... just keep an eye on your purse.

I give this place 3.5 stars.  I live very close by, and opt to go here or even order out.  Good sushi -- haven't had a bad experience here yet.  The staff is very friendly.My favorite dishes here are:The Volcano Roll, which is a baked california roll topped with scallops and mayo and rolled up in salmon,The Tuna Karai Sashimi, which is an awesome Japanese version of Hawaiian poke,and the Johnny Roll, a deliciously light shrimp tempura wrapped in cucumber.Besides the all you can eat they also have bento boxes available.  Overall a great place to eat sushi on the northwest side. :)

Review Text :
Madison may as well be located in the high desert when it comes to QUALITY seafood... well, actually, that's not true - I've had some of the most amazing sashimi of my entire life while in Joshua Tree, California.  So much for that analogy.But you get my point - Madison consumers don't have many options for fresh, quality fish, nor do we have a ton of knowledgable fish mongers to work with.We do, however, have The Seafood Center!  And, holy catfish (sorry Angie from FTS), are these guys awesome!  I felt like making fish tacos last night, so we fired-up Yelp and found a few recommendations for fresh seafood.  My first choice, "Seafood Center" on Junction Road closed on January 1.  In a panic, I raced over to this location and was relieved to find them open, and very busy.The location is small, but don't let the size deter you - they are packed to the gills with fantastic fish.  There's also a kitchen in the back that offers a variety of deep fried piscine platters, but I was there for the uncooked stuff.A super friendly monger asked if he could assist me with anything.  I told him I was planning to do some grilled fish tacos and was considering Halibut, Tilapia, or Mahi.He immediately offered that they were out of Mahi, and that he only had about half-a-pound of Halibut left.  The Tilapia, while farmed, was fresh and would be "fine" for a taco.  He then suggested I check out the Corvina - it had arrived earlier in the day, was line caught, and would be superb for grilling.  He offered me a smell of the fish - it was completely odorless - the whole shop is odorless, in fact - and that's a good sign when shopping for fish.I took 1.25 pounds of the Corvina - he skinned it for me, wrapped it in plastic, put it on ice, and presented me with the bounty.  I haven't had that kind of experience since I lived in San Francisco and Austin.I will be back!!!  This place is truly incredible, and I hope Madison will continue to support this location.  If you're looking for some awesome seafood, swing through The Seafood Center - it's definitely the real deal.Oh - so how were the tacos?  Amazing!  I marinated the Corvina in lime, cilantro, jalapeno, and a splash of tequila, then grilled it on the Big Green Egg for about 9 minutes or so (at 400F).  Whipped-up some incredible spicy slaw, some black refried beans, and an amazing sauce.  A corn tortilla and a slice of avocado made for a stellar dinner.  None of it would've been possible without the help of The Seafood Center (and Yelp)!

Review Text :
Rolando's occupies a former Taco Bell carcass and has been here for ten years.  Why have I been missing this place?  I'm not afraid of dingy booths and a CASH ONLY sign!They may look like one of your typical indie mexican fast foods with the big white menu board with red and green letters, but they really served up some delicious food when I stopped in for some takeout this weekend.Two friendly dudes were running the show, and one of them was even wearing a chef's coat.  I thought it was silly at first, but not after tasting the cuisine they plated up in styrofoam showcase boxes.Shredded chicken tacos, even with a fried, hard shell, were not the least bit greasy, and even though they fell apart while eating them I was able to fork up every single bit of the remains without dodging any greasy or fatty bits (NO DISCARD PILE!).   The same applied to soft corn shell carne asada tacos, with fresh made guacamole and tomatoey-onioney-cilantroey pico de gallo.  I didn't have the beans, but even they didn't look greasy at all, and the rice was fluffy and light, if a bit on the bland side.The 'green' sauce was absolutely yummy, with enough spiciness but flavorful heat, not show-off heat.Rolando's having a guy in a chef's coat is no joke; this is mexican fast food at its finest and for cheap, too!  Spending less than $14 on two full combos meant plenty left over for some Stone IPA to wash it down.Of the non-chain Mexican food places in my area, this is the closest to where I live but it took me a few years to finally try it out. That's because it doesn't have the flashy signs and banners that the other places have, and because the small, somewhat run-down building fades into the background of the countless business and food establishments in the area. But while it serves standard small Mexican food joint fare, the food here is good; not exactly fast food, as it took a while for me to get what I ordered, but the quality is a tad above that of the ubiquitous 'Berto-type  restaurants of the Valley.

Great place for Chinese noodle dishes. They  make their noodles fresh every day. Extensive menu includes interesting dishes from multiple regions in China. There are plenty of rice dishes as well.My husband ALWAYS orders the bun ga, a pork noodle dish served in a bowl with a sauce on the side. It's probably his favorite meal in Madison and is one of the most popular on the menu.Tonight I had the pan fried crispy noodles with seafood and veg on top. The sauce from the seafood and vegetables slowly migrates through the crunchy noodles, making for great texture. There were at least 5 species of seafood or shellfish plus a nice variety of vegetables. I really liked it and would order it again. As always, portions were large and I'm taking tomorrow's lunch home with me.I also always drink their great ginger tea and enjoy the crab rangoon.

Review Text :
Consistently the best "purist" BBQ in CLT. Meat is cooked over **real** wood in a pit I would be proud to have in my home (yes, I am a BBQ freak). Wife is instructed to have these guys cater my wake.Most/all the BBQ posers these days cook with gas or electricity. It ain't the same folks. Before you go into a BBQ restaurant, drive around back. Woodpile? If not, keep driving. Is the wood neatly stacked? If so, be suspicious because a fellow smoking meat at 4AM isn't typically neat with his pile. Does the restaurant only seem to smoke during dinner hours? We've got a chain joint near us which cooks electrically, but has a smoke-emitting stack- kinda like a smoke-sign. I refuse to set foot in the place on principal.Hickory House does pork, beef, and chicken. The beef and chicken may be good (can't say), but this **is** North Carolina, folks. The only BBQ worth having in NC is pork. Never order french onion soup at a chinese place, I say. Go to Texas if you want beef.As others have said, this place is a nondescript, brick, rectangle in an area of North Tryon which has seen better days. Ever heard of the Hidden Valley Kings? Lock your car and hide your valuables. Speaking from personal experience, here.This is one of those buildings I wish could talk. The restaurant obviously started out as a road-house of sorts back when this part of the world was out in "the woods". I bet it has a ghost or two roaming around. Looks like the kind of place your parents' doctor/lawyer/accountant met his receptionist for "overtime" work back in the 60's.Personally, I am partial to their chopped BBQ sammich, brunswick stew, and hush puppies. If you're lucky/blessed/living right, your sammich will have some crunchy "outside" in it. You can get the sammich with or without slaw- your choice. I alternate.Brunswick stew is worth driving across town for (I do).The hushpuppies are not health food, but they are addictive. We start out with an order as an appetizer. Don't know where they come from, but they will contribute to my early demise, I'm sure.If you're like me and despise MBA-driven, vinyl restaurants, Hickory House ought to be on your short list. This is the place I hold up as the finest example in CLT of the way BBQ is supposed to be done. Even if the food wasn't 5-star, it is worth a trip just so you can tell your kids about it someday. There are fewer and fewer of these places left every day and we'll all be poorer when they're gone.Yelp, you have served me well...once more. I was suffering through one of  the longest road trips I have ever endured (ATL to DC) and we had to stop for gas. Did a quick search for barbecue near me and I found out Old Hickory was 5 minutes down the road. We walk in and are greeted by the cutest bartender/waitress ever. Behind her all I could see was open fire and what I'd describe as meat heaven. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a barbecue chicken sandwich and all were pleased.Excellent recommendation for a miserable road trip.What appears to be a classic barbecue joint that might have been here for decades, Old Hickory House is feeling its age. But hey, so what? The second clue that it was going to be good was when we noticed that there was no extra sauce on the table. "These folks mean it," I said to my dining companion.We ordered a couple of barbecue platters it is was more than decent. Finely chopped pork and beef topped with a sauce that was both tomato based and still had a good vinegar kick. I had mine with beans and Brunswick stew. A basket with four slices of excellent Texas toast was also delivered.A very different Brunswick stew from one I've ever had before. While it's probably an old family recipe, it was mush (like an oatmeal texture) and had quite a lot of corn in it. Strange?

There aren't many Cajun restaurants in the area to compete w/ Razoo's.  However, this place won't disappoint! If you like spicy food you will enjoy eating here. They serve 'Nawlins style food including fish, chicken, and crawdads/crayfish. This is only place in the area that I know of that serves crawfish. If you aren't a fan of seafood, the menu is big enough to accommodate your tastes. Additionally, the drinks here are great. Sometimes, my friend and I come here on Friday nights just for a drink or two. I love their frozen "Mardi-rita" and potent "Worm Burner."The service is good/average and the decor is colorful, as the theme is Mardi Gras-esque.

Ghetto mexican food. Located in the shadiest of spots, it remains open 24/7food is better if you are inebriated but otherwise still decent.Nothing special mexican taco stand, food is kinda bland nothing too spicy. Pork was kinda tough, beff was stringy, chicken was dry.No pico? WTF!! Place looked like the person cleaning the dining room went to break right in the middle and left their stuff strung all over.I would avoid this place-really kinda shitty but hell it's a long ways before anything else if you live in this neighborhood. poor you.OK so this is really a fun review I am excited to add to my Yelp collection!At approximately 2am in the morning my Yelp buddy Jon calls and invites me for a bite out. Yes, even though I was already in bed relaxing watching tv, I accepted his invite as I am very spontaneous and always ready to stuff my mouth! OK so I got dressed, he was at my house in 15 or so minutes and we were on our way headed to Pepe's!I had eaten here once before pre-yelp days. This time was most definitely Yelp worthy, we were craving tacos so tacos we had!First off they are open 24/7 to satisfy our late night and early morning munch cravings!The tacos were good, I ordered a chicken and asada soft taco plate which came with rice and beans. My pal ordered birria soft tacos which were delicious, I have never had marinated goat meat, he gave me a taste of his and those were yummy as well.Reminds me of the street and truck tacos you can get in town, definitely better than the other more commercial Mexican food joints around. We had fun sitting, chatting and grubbing! Although the food was great I still have many other taco joints to check out!Mmmm until the next mouth stuffing rendezvous I am out :) Peace!I remember when this was originally "Miller's Steakhouse". That place was no good but, Pepe's took over years ago and it seems to have stuck. Being a fan of Pepe's in Cali I was always hesitant about trying this place. I didn't know if it was the same or completely different. With only one way to find out I headed on my way. The parking lot was packed. I was lucky to nab the last spot. It was busy inside. I placed my order and waited maybe 8-10 minutes for my food. I saw others waiting too so I knew it might be a minute and they were cooking it fresh. I ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" and the "Cheese Quesadilla". The tortillas are yummy. The burrito was good in size and tasted decent but wasn't spectacular. The real winner was the quesadilla. It was cheeeeeesy! I noticed a sign inside that said they only accepted cash however the cashier asked me if I wanted to pay with cash or debit. Pepe's is open 24 hours.I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!Pepe's compared to Roberto's. Pepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.Also the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.Overall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.The only thing I would do different is keep the salsa station clean.So it usually bothers me when someone puts they have the best fill in the blank in town.. However, Pepe's Taco can do it. They have my seal of approval. In their establishment they have a sign that reads best carne asada nachos in town. They aren't wrong. They have great food for a great price. I came here for some late night ratchetness and brought along a friend to fatten him up. First thing I notice when I walk in is all the seating. Usually places only have a couple seat for you to wait or a couple tables on the side for people dining in. This location had seats on either side and some cool benches. On Yelp it says they close at 2, but they are actually open 24 hours which I was thankful for. Who knew you could sit and talk in a taco shop for almost 2 hours. I of course had to be fat and order the nachos. My friend ordered some pork tacos. We sat down and waited for our food. I see them all the time and it makes me laugh but they have the posted signs for no refills or there will be an additional charge. I think we refilled our drink like 5 times and nothing was said.. I know they are trying to watch their costs and whatnot but it's like cents per cup. They also have a jukebox that randomly plays music and stares the pee out of you. After getting my food I hit the salsa bar and grab green salsa, my favorite, and some limes. I know it was late but everything seemed kind of empty. I think grabbed the last limes.. oh well. They i opened my box and went in on my nachos. They had everything a little separated which I liked. All in all I had a fun time being ratchet at 1 in the morning.

Ahh Captain Bill's Sub Factory.  If you rep the metrocenter area as I have since my birth in 73 then you no doubt have eaten at Captain Bill's.  I've been eating subs there for nearly 25 years.  This place is a true phoenix landmark.Simply put, I love this place.  I love everything about it.  Where else can you roll in with 3 bucks and roll out full?I used to ride my skateboard up there in the mid eighties and take the trash out for the many hot chicks both from cortez and moon valley that worked there at the time and they would feed me free subs.  Then I would play 720 until they kicked me out.Nothing beats a Captain Bills Italian sub.  Nothing.I continued to go there over the years, I got married, I had kids and I took them there.As I sat there this afternoon with my 16 year old son feeling sentimental as the faces of those I knew so long ago stared back up at me from the tables.  I vowed to never eat a sub anywhere ever again but at good ole Captain Bill's.As we left my son commented that the chicks were hot.  "They always were" I said, "they always were."Thanks Bill.While on the hunt for something for the family to quickly eat at a nearby Basketball Tournament , we decide to give ole Bill a try.  Love the  kitschy vibe of this place.Tons of  funny- to obnoxious stickers and signs plaster the place.   For a minute I thought it was Two Hippies Sub shoppe.  But this little hole in the wall does a soild business slinging out the standard american sub.  While nothing to flavorful was ordered by my Troupe, I am willing to go back and find the hidden gems that must be in  this dive.   Word to the Wise bring cash or be prepared to pay a dollar fee for a debit /credit card... really?

This is basically the only acceptable bar to go to in Madison, WI if you are not a hippie or college student. It is dingy, it is gross, the bartenders are surly and these is a distinctive 'dise smell that permeates your clothing and your soul. I love it like a second home. The drinks are cheap, the place is LOADED with interesting people, (read possible criminals? senators with their escorts? other assorted ne'er-do-wells? who cares?) the music is loud and Misfit-y. The bartenders aren't THAT surly and some still remember me some 5 years after leaving Madison. They make the drinks strong, and they are FAST!It gets pretty packed after 9 on any given night, so I recommend getting there early. Around noon is acceptable. The food's pretty top notch. It is your typical bar fare, but if I hear another person rave about the 'dise burger, I may have to abandon my vegetarian principals to find out how awesome it is for myself. Luckily, I will always have the the cheese balls, which are vegetarian-ish.Thier greasy, stringy, melty dipped in ranch cheesiness has me missing Wisconsin on a semi-regular basis. For the vegans in your life, there are green olives. Soaked in vodka. Just eat them. 5 years and 3 trips back to Madison, this is the place I have the airport cabbie drop me off first.Giving it a 5, if you're a hipster or frat kid this isn't the bar for you (thank goodness) beer is cheap service fast

We really like Super Mex.  It has pretty decent Tex Mex offerings and a pretty large menu.  They even have a discounted and a "lite" menu, for even more options.  You are bound to find something you like here.We started going to Super Mex when I found a few buy one get one coupons from the Vegas Entertainment book.  I love a good coupon and the place was around the corner from where hubby works, so of course we had to go.  I am so happy we went too because the food is pretty yummy!  It is good, solid Tex Mex style food at reasonable prices.Our favorite dishes are the chimichangas, gigantic burritos, tacos, and the flautas.   I actually get the chimi 8 out of 10 times that we go because they are so addictive!  You can even get them enchilada style, meaning covered in red enchilada sauce and cheese, which is simply AMAZING!  My hubby is the same way with the tacos.  Yummy!On top of the menu items, you also get chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The chips are actually tostadas that you break apart and scoop the yumminess onto.  The salsa at Super Mex is really good too.  It doesn't taste like your average salsa from other places.  It is darker in color and has different layers of flavor.  Tasty!  And the bean dip rocks.  I usually finished it off before my hubby and daughter can even get a bite.  Hey, you snooze, you lose when there is bean dip on the table next to me!The service here is hit and miss though.  Sometimes you get awesome service and sometimes not.  That is why I wen with 3 stars.  The food is easily 4 stars and is pretty consistent in my opinion.So see you at Super Mex.  I will be the one stuffing my face with a chimichanga!

They're a 3 1/4  in my book, although a seafood fan might be more impressed.There was a lot of seafood to select on Saturday for lunch, which I did not try, but saw plenty of classy customers literally carrying handfulls away from the boofay.  No kidding, there were multiple people doing it -- stacking their plate so high with crab legs that they had to hold the pile in place with their free hand draped over the top while walking back to the table.  Class like that you don't find in other cities, for sure, but the West side? Sheeeeeeet..Aside from the abundant shellfish, I found a moderate assortment of chicken dishes, beef ribs, and plenty of the usuals, with the addition of a neat flour shell chicken taco thing I really enjoyed.Discard Pile~2.5McKenna Novelty Factor~3.5Greasy / Crispy Spectrum~3NQI * ~ big fat ZERO               The napkins were stupid.  They were too small and way too thin with no absorbancy and no gription at all.  I don't care how much cheaper they were for the restaurant to buy than a normal napkin, I had to go through two dozen of the little shits, making a huge pile of sticky, greasy wads on the table and plate.  With ribs and crab legs, all of the customers were using at least as many as was I.  Unless they pay less than 1/24th the price of the same number of normal napkins, they're wasting money on those little shit napkins.  Yeah, they left me pretty pioughd.* Napkin Quality indicatorAnother ciriteria of mine for judging a boofay or other restaurant.  Cloth or paper? What kind of paper quality and thickness?

Restaurant name  Bandung Indonesian Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Confession: I have been to Indonesia and had plenty of local Indonesian food. So my standards are high and my comments might not represent the masses.First let's talk about the service. The waitresses were less than friendly/ professional. One of them interrupted my boyfriend when he was asking her a question. When I asked her what was in a particular dish, she said, "exactly as it says on the menu: beef, onions, peppers, etc.". I wondered if I looked blind or illiterate to her? Then when I asked her to heat up a soup dish because it was cold, she said "well, it shouldn't be cold, because it just came off the stove". I guess she either likes her soup cold, or she doesn't understand the difference between "putting it on the stove" and "serving the soup after it boils". It took her forever to take the soup back out to us. Shortly after we were done, she dropped the check on our table without saying anything. When we had to wait for change, she took so long we had to go up to the counter to ask for it. Now let's talk about the food. Before I went to Bandung, I asked my Indonesian friend and my other friend who works there for suggestions. So naturally, I ordered the "authentic" and "best dishes" of the house: SATE KAMBING (marinated lamb skewers with rice cakes), RED CURRY SQUASH, and SOTO AYAM (lemon grass flavored broth with chicken breast, bean sprouts, green onion, egg and mung bean noodle). Well, the Sate Kambing and Soto Ayam came out COLD, which they were NOT supposed to be. There was way too much sauce on the lamb, and the portion is very small for it's price ($12.95 for 6 tiny skewers). Also, the rice cake was very lumpy and mushy. I could barely tell that it was rice. The Soto Ayam was way too salty. Red curry squash was ok, but I could have had this dish at any Thai- or Asian-inspired restaurants. Meh.This is one of the few situations when bad service coupled with worse-than-average food truly ruined my evening. I was very excited about going to an Indonesian restaurant and I went home completely unsatisfied and disappointed.If you ever have dinner with me in the near future it's likely you'll hear me say: "Let's get something spicy, I mean like Bandung spicy." "Let's get something really creative, I mean like Bandung creative.""Let's get something super flavorful, I mean like Bandung super flavorful." (You see where I'm going, yes?)Bandung has set the standard for me here in Madison of what it means to bring spice, flavor and creativity into a really interesting dish that you're not going to find on any other menu in town. I'll be honest, after reading the reviews online and driving by the dumpy little strip it's in, I didn't have much reason to check out the inside. BUT, Tenth & Blake hosted a Yelp Elite event last month which served as my first introduction and I couldn't wait to get back. (But I did, like 3 weeks... what the hell was I thinking?!)The menu is huge, there's something for everyone regardless of if you like spice or not. There are also safe options if you're not ready to plunge into Indonesian right away (but just do it). I started with a chicken and steak skewer and holy cow... for grilled meat these things are bomb. So much flavor. So much great char on the outside but juicy and moist on the inside. From there I moved on to the Ikan Rica Rica and I need to pause and collect my thoughts... ...This dish, without a doubt is one of the best things I've had in Madison, certainly the best fish dish. An ENORMOUS filet of mahi-mahi is lightly breaded and served on a bed of steamed vegetables with a lime leaf and candle nut sauce and diced tomatoes, ginger and sambal. Holy cow... HOLY COW! my mouth is watering just thinking about the little bit I have left in the fridge (it's big). There aren't really words to describe how good this dish is. A cornucopia of spicy, sweet flavors and flaky fish. The veggies are flavorful! Not just steamed mush. Just go, get it, you won't be disappointed.But if you are disappointed, send me a message. I'll take you back to Bandung (my treat) if you have a one-star experience. Because honestly I don't know how that's possible. Seriously. If you truly believe it's one star, I'll meet you there and we'll find you a favorite. (I'm looking at you Maria.)The folks easy make it into my top 5 in Madison. And they should be in yours too.I don't understand. I just don't get it.Why doesn't this place have a bajillion reviews? There's nothing else like it.Why is it that nobody knows what I'm talking about when I mention it? Why is it always empty at lunch?Maybe people are so overcome by the flavor profiles they aren't certain what to write? Maybe I don't know enough adventurous eaters? Maybe everyone goes there at dinner? LUNCH IS WHERE IT'S AT YOU GUYS! Dishes range from 8.50-11.00, pack quite a punch and offer up the perfect amount of food. This is probably the one place in town where I don't get the same thing time and time again, because the menu is so interesting... so diverse and it'll take you months to try everything. I thought I had a favorite, you can read my earlier review, but the catfish today blew me away. Sweet, salty, spicy it had everything I look for but didn't leave me feeling over full. The crisp veggies and perfectly portioned rice round out the meal. And if catfish isn't your thing, eye over their other seafood options. They are plentiful, and servers are equipped with tons of knowledge about each dish. Go.Eat.LOVE.I look forward to the day I go at 12:30 and they say, "Sorry it's going to be about 25 minutes until we can seat you."In the mood for comfort Indonesian food? It exists!We ordered from Bandung about a year ago, and I know I loved my indo mac n cheese. We somehow never made it into the building itself until a Yelp Elite event. Yay!Nice interior, and especially nice bar area. Big and open. The bartender was sassy and funny, and made us some great cocktails. Helloooo, Thai Iced Tea. We also nibbled on bites like cream cheese filled wontons and chicken wings (well, Derek did that one).For our meals, Derek got chicken pad thai and I got the tofu fried rice. We ordered them off the small bites/happy hour menu. SO cheap! Derek's pad thai was much better than my fried rice. It was peanut-y and not too sweet. My fried rice was just a little too dry for my taste, but I liked the flavor overall. And each plate was piled high.Thanks for a great treat! Can't wait to visit again and try something new.Real good food, real nice staff - especially the hostess! Although very busy, she was greeting people, seating people, working with the kitchen by bringing food out, and even helping out a newbie waitress on her first day alone - all with a smile on her face. Nothin' but kindness, which only added to the cozy and warm atmosphere here.When it comes to food, you cannot go wrong with the Krakatau. We chose chicken, which was served sizzling, in a sweet garlic sauce. I did not taste garlic, but it was damn good nonetheless. Another item we enjoyed was the Bakmi Goreng - a very large portion of egg noodles flavored with soy sauce, mixed with an assortment of veggies. Definitely a filling and delicious meal.Although stuffed, I could not pass up on dessert. Ordered the Pisang Goreng and I fell madly in love. I've posted a photo, and yes, it does taste as good as it looks.Guess what you can now get at night, folks, that you couldn't get before? A smaller portion of pretty much ANYTHING ON THE MENU! That's right, where you once had to head there for lunch in order to feast on flavorful dishes a bit smaller in size and lower in price, you can now order many of your lunch favorites at dinner! The redesigned menu lays it all out pretty clearly, showing you different price-points for different sizes, at lunch your meal comes with an appetizer, and at night a basket-o-chips! If you aren't able to make it over there mid-day and are nervous about committing to a large dish at dinner, there's no excuse now to give them a try! It's an 8-11 buck investment in some of the most intriguing and flavorful food you'll find in the area.I've dined at Bandung of my own accord and with a Yelp event, and both trips were unique in the dishes and flavors I was able to try.My first experience here was on a chilly day and I ordered the perfect entree to warm up. I settled on the Pad Rum Mit, which was chicken stir fried with broccoli, fresh mushroom, napa, baby corn and pea pods in a light spicy garlic sauce. White rice was served alongside the hearty plate and made for a great deal of food.The next time at Bandung was with Yelp and we sampled the pangsit keju (cream cheese wontons) as a group. I then ordered the Gado Gado as my entree, which was a steamed green bean, carrot, cabbage, broccoli, bean sprouts, egg and tempeh topped with mild peanut sauce. The peanut sauce made the plate. Without it, I would not be loving this dish so much as the combination of cooked and raw veggies, along with the ever interestingly textured tempeh, was weird. When topped with peanut sauce though, I could pretty much polish the plate.  I will certainly be back to try more of their dishes once the weather cools down and curries begin calling my name.

I was all geared up to eat at the ELEPHANT of all Thai restaurants, but when I got there... it was too busy.  So the wife and I shuffled next door to this gem.I overheard this used to be "Yoshi's" which kind of makes sense.  Its the same Japanese style bowls, but oh-so-much better.First off, they have pictures of their dishes plastered all over their walls and doors.  They all look good but then I heard an angel and she steered my wicked eyes toward the holy grail of dishes... Bulgoki.  I was overwhelmed.  I grabbed my wife's shoulder to avoid dropping to my knees in praise to the Japanese Bowl gods.  Lucky for me my wife is young and strong or I would have taken her down with me.I, of course, order the Bulgoki and my wife orders the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken.  My wife grabs a table outside and I grab a pomegranite and jasmine iced tea and as many napkins as my miniature hands could carry (in preparation for the feast).  The wait was nil.  If it had been any shorter of a wait, time would be going backwards and I would have been dining with Socrates. Thankfully, I was still with my wife and I joined her at our table.  Her Chicken was too spicy for our liking, but we both liked the Bulgoki. DUH!Anyway, this place is rockin'To sum it up, the wait was great and the dish was delish.BTW Chris,  Its spelled with a G not a K! Like this "BULGOGI".

Good food, great service and they have been there since 1980...WTF a business that is still around after 30 years... must be good.So my coworker was really promoting this place to me, and I felt like Chinese food so our decision was made.......Horrible mistake!Number One: Disgusting bland food. Every single (limited selection) dish sucked! The orange chicken tasted like old microwaved from freezer over sauced cardboard. The onion rings were crap. The egg rolls, crap. The chow mein noodles which I thought were supposed to look brown, were these pale watery strans of crap. The rice, which was clearly not white rice, was bland. The desserts sucked as well. Also, the presentation of the food looked very sloppy. Number Two: Horrible enviornment. Ugly pink walls with horrible dollar store decorations. The booth seats were WAAAAYYY to close to the tables which made for an uncomfortable sitting experience. The sneeze guards were dirty. Weird smell. And stupid layout, with a couple of booths too close to the employee personal area and some too close to the (again small) buffet line. Number Three: After this review, I am calling the health services on this disgustng place. A couple of times I noticed an employee scratching their nose, and then continuing with their work. Then I was forcing down my food when my coworker spots a moving insect on the wall next to us. It was a BABY COCKROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screw this place. I will never ever go back here. And if this place isnt shut down, I hope nobody else does either. On the plus side, its only $6.00. But still not worth it. If I could, I would give this place negetive 1000000000000000000000 stars.If you're looking for the same americhino fare that you had here in 1983, well, there it is.  Same menu, same recipes, same grease.There's nothing too terrible about their greasy, fried: (rice, egg rolls, chicken, chicken wings, sesame chicken, onion rings, egg foo young, s&s pork, and jello).Yes, even the jello was deep fried and greasy.  Not really.There's just not much selection, and what you get is 'mbleh'.(that's half 'meh' and half 'blah')Everyone keeps saying "well, at least it's only $6."  Well, for that price, I could pick from a half dozen gems within a mile radius of this nostalgic black hole boofay of yester-year.But I'll generously round them up -  they're friendly, the food's tasty and filling, and fuggit it was only $6.

Ok so who has not eaten at Friday's?This review is dedicated to my sweetheart ex Chris whom took me here to dine over and over again, pre Yelp days. Seriously we probably ate here close to 20 times within one year.***Sign up for the Stars and Stripes club online and you will get monthly emails for buy one get one free meal*** This is the ONLY reason we would visit so often, the savings we could not resist and the food is good!* Side note looks like they have changed recently, now they are offering buy one get one half off meal, not the same as bogo they have been doing the last couple of years :(We used to both order the Jack's Signature steak and shrimp dinner, they would take off $19.99 the price of one of our meals, was so worth it.Anything dipped in or covered in the Jack's signature sauce is delicious!I always ask for extra Jack Daniel's sauce, mmmm and is really good when you use it as a dip for sweet potato fries! The bomb diggity!Awwwww the sweet memories, have not been in awhile.This location rocks! Avoid the Friday's located in casino's example Orlean's Hotel & Casino as that one sucks ass.

This BK is near my house and I get coupon booklets in the mail often. I wouldn't eat here as much if I didn't have the coupons. The burgers are fast food average and the veggies are usually fresh. The workers are nice but the wait time can be brutal often. I do like the cinnabon options they have I just don't like when they put in the box and bag upside down so that when I open it the frosting isn't everywhere but on the bun.I rate this burger king as a 5 star for ONE REASON...every time I come here they have me pull forward and wait for my chicken sandwich. Most people would typically get frustrated with these actions, but I appreciate the fresh chicken and not giving me a reheated patty. I don't mind waiting two min for fresh food...instead of choking down a dried out microwaved chicken sandwich. Either way...I rarely eat fast food, but this location is bearable.

Review Text :
Since Mr. K's excellent review, Underwraps has made a few changes. (Hey! Maybe they read your review?) You can now order salads (five types from Asian or Greek to Caesar or Cobb) and the sides to chose from include potato chips (which ROCK and are made in-house), potato salad or pasta salad (they scratched the fries). The grilled vegetable wrap IS tasty: kalamata olives, grilled squash, roasted green peppers, red onion, lemon vinaigrette, but I also really like to do the scrambled egg (crispy bacon, caramelized onion, tomato and melted provolone cheese). They even make it egg whites only for me!I do think a lot of their business is catering... and they've got some good offers. You can serve 11-14 people assorted wraps for just $50! This place is close to where I work and it's not generally too crowded, so it's easy enough to get in and out. I'm gonna round up and give it four stars for taste and convenience!

Review Text :
Buffet @ Asia is a place that has never peaked my interest until recently when a family member raved about their Sunday dinner.    Come Sunday, and you have three ravenous individuals who just came from biking outside in the 107 degree Vegas weather.  (Yeah, we're crazy.)We walked in around 5 pm, and there's already a line.  Straight to the register, $15.99/pp (adults) and we're seated at a table.  There's a Mongolian BBQ station - you pick your veggies and meat and they cook it up on this giant flat stove thing for you.  (We all skipped this, which might explain why we never saw the kalbi short ribs everyone else talked about. Damn.)Sushi - They have a bunch of random rolls with lots of sauce and stuff and some salmon sashimi.  That was something we all avoided as well.Seafood - green mussels, baked scallops (my friend wasn't sure if there was scallop in there b/c they mix it up with stuff and cover it up with sauce), jumbo hot shrimp (old), cooked cold shrimp (fresh, and not overly cooked - over by the salad bar section), oysters on the half shell (big ones - okay, a bit too 'milky' for me), lobster, salt and pepper crab (not the freshest), snow crab legs (we mostly ate this and a lot of it, with drawn butter), deep-fried frog legs (old), deep-fried calamari (okay), baked salmon, clams (pretty good), and I'm sure a few other things I overlooked.  (There was no crawfish though, unfortunately!)Cooked items - stir-fried strings beans (I ate a lot of this), mixed veggies with shrimp, beef and broccoli, fried rice, steamed rice, asparagus, potstickers (skin was old), crab ragoons, eggrolls, deep-fried chicken wings, etc.Soup - wonton soup, oxtail soup, egg drop soup.Dessert - fresh fruit and marshmallows for dipping into chocolate, egg custard tarts (blah), almond cookies, soft serve, almond jello with fruit cocktail, mango mousse, sesame balls, malasadas (would be better if they were hot), tapioca, and a few other things.Service is super attentive, especially in clearing plates.  They greet you right away with beverage orders and it's not to hard to wave them down for refills, extra napkins, shell crackers, etc.Overall, you really can't complain about the price.  We went on one of their more expensive nights and I think we had enough crab to definitely surpass our money's worth.  You have to wonder how they even turn a profit.  Some of the food is just blah, but at least you can have a taste and never get more.  And then there's a handful of things that will have you returning for more.  It works for picky eaters too.  Their menu seems to be changing all the time, so you never know what you're gonna get!  I've had better buffets (that cost more), and worse Asian ones too.  They obviously are doing something right because there's a lot of people dining here.My Mom loves this place and comes here at least once a month.  I, on the other hand, think it's just A-OK.  There's a nice selection of food, but it seems lacking to me.  Here's my +/- breakdown:+ Large selection of food.  There's plenty of options.  They even have Pizza, although I don't recommend it....it's an Asian Buffet for Pete's sake!+ Decent service.  This place is always busy and they usually keep up with the pace.  Food is generally kept stocked on the food lines and the servers keep the glasses full.+ Food quality is OK for a buffet.  It's not great, but hell it's AYCE.....this isn't the Bellagio Buffet.+ Price.  The price use to be really good, but they've been steadily increasing prices over the past couple of years.....but still, $6.99 for a lunch buffet?!  That's pretty cheap in my book.- Parking.  Parking is a bitch when it's busy.....it's not the restaurant's fault though and my Star Rating doesn't reflect this....just saying, FYI.Overall, it's pretty good value.  If you don't like waiting, I suggest going in between meal periods when it's slower than peak times.Return Factor - 75%When you need an all-you-can-eat fix (AYCE F), this place will do it.  Easier than going to a hotel, it's a standalone building with fairly easy parking.  It's cheap, ahem, well-priced.  With Lunch $8.29 & Dinner $12.49 (drinks extra), a little goes a long way.Influenced by Japanese and Chinese cooking, it has all the goodies you can expect.  A plethora of a selection that includes Sushi, Mussels, Fried Dumplings, BBQ Spareribs, noodles, and salad bar for lunch.  Add to that for dinner: Snow Crab, New Zealand Green Mussels, cocktail shrimp, and a small Mongolian section - yum.Take it from me whose dined here 5-6 times over the years, it's A-Okay in my book.PS.  They even have pizza!Decent-enough buffet: lots of seafood and traditional Asian dishes here, though the salads and dessert sections are minimal. A few fried and Americanized options available, making this place a bit more kid-friendly than you might expect.Found it odd that this place also has a full bar? Sushi roll offerings at dinnertime are extensive: several special rolls, though they are not labeled, so be prepared to try a lot or be able to identify the types of fish you do/don't like. Some nigiri available, too.Lots of crab, preference was for the salt and pepper fried Jonah crab claws rather than the typical Alaskan. $13/person weeknight dinner is not outrageous, and you can easily get your money's worth here, but this place isn't likely to blow your mind. Service is also what you'd expect for an Asian buffet, no surprises there.If you enjoy Asian food buffets, are in the area and don't mind feeling sick for a couple days afterwards...stop on in and indulge in the unsanitary overpriced delicacies of the Orient!Been coming here since this place transformed from a prime rib steakhouse back in the mid 1990s and it has drastically gone down hill.For at least a dozen years, Buffet Asia truly was excellent, both lunch and dinner; but something happened. My guess is 1, 2 or more of the following...Ownership change, management change, food distributor, chefs, prep cook training classes were possibly never offered, OSHA and CCHD not involved enough, etc., etc.Upon walking in, the hostess asked us if we needed a table in 1 of the 4 dining areas or if want to eat in the bar. My reply..."No, I do not want to sit in the bar with my children and eat!" So I was given a piece of paper with a handwritten # on it. Took this time to admire the cartoon framed pictures of dogs playing poker, seen on the wall outside the restrooms. This was the best part of our dinner. Went to wash our hands and the men's room floor and mirrors were dirty, trash was overflowing, and both dispensers were out of hand soap.After waiting for at least 20 minutes for a table to eat our dinner, I asked how much longer til our # was up. Shortly thereafter, we were seated at a table in the backroom. The distance was a bit of a struggle for me considering I was using crutches from a recent leg surgery.The friendly server brought us our sodas promptly and kept them refilled throughout our dinner. For this, she earned $2 per person at this self served buffet.The food selection was plentiful...offering an array of chicken, beef and seafood Asian creations...along w/ several fried foods, fruit, sushi, almond cookies and vanilla soft serve ice cream. Thanks to my son helping carry some plates of food, while I was on crutches, I tried a little of many. The skewers of chicken was my favorite.It was very noticeable that many of the food selections were sitting way too long as several items were not being eaten, resulting in foods dried out and clumped together in sticky unappetizing sweet/salty sauces. The area that dining patrons can select veggies and meats, and have the chef prepare custom entrees did not look appealing, as the raw meat selections looked as if they were sitting too long, but we were so hungry especially after the long waiting line up front, that we tried it anyway. Tipped the chef with several bills placed on top of the ordering counter. Overall, what we did eat, was just ok, certainly not the quality nor taste as experienced over the past dozen years or so patronizing this restaurant. The dinner prices were higher than the last dinner and that was higher priced than the previous. Everytime we come here, the price increases to the point it's now comparably priced to nearby hotel buffets.Unfortunately my family and I, each and all of us, felt stomach cramps and related illness within an hour of leaving this dinner, resulting in the purchase of Immodium at a nearby store. Conclusion based on this dining experience...the only things remaining good about this restaurant are some of the people that work there and the customers who don't know any better, and the original cartoon poker playing dog pictures on the wall which came with the sale from The Hungry Hunter about 18 years ago.  1 star for the cute dog pictures and that's being generous!Listed among "Eek! Me thinks not."YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #216

Review Text :
4.5 stars!Came for dinner the other night, and quickly wanted to comment on the baked dishes.  (Since I am pregnant and must abstain from raw dishes- it gave me a chance to try other items from the menu). Although I was salivating watching my husband enjoy his spicy tuna hand roll, and a complimentary sushi that the chef prepared for him- my volcano roll and seaweed salad were DELICIOUS. We also shared a Red Snapper Teriyaki combination box and we practically licked that plate clean.  Perhaps when I am no longer pregnant, I will order a baked dish again.  Who am I kidding? I am craving their uni and ame ebi like crazy!It never fails that every time I try to write a review for Yummy, it's when Yelp is down for maintenance!  I've been coming here for years (my pre-Yelp years) since I work around the corner. I come here every week almost and this week I was here twice...mostly to-go orders and the occasional  meeting up with Yelpers.   I come here too often that I should be getting desensitized by their food by now...but no!I keep getting the same stuff which is a problem of mine: edamame, salmon sashimi, spicy salmon bowl, any rolls with salmon or tuna.  The quality of fish here is good. I've tried their scallops, blue fin and uni before - those were amazing. It's a good thing I didn't go here alone today and I got to try other items on their lunch menu like their pork belly (one of the best I've had. The fat was rendered well so you don't get that gross glob of fat in your mouth feel), garlic edamame (I stepped away from the regular edamame this time. They were very garlicky and a bit spicy and oh so delicious!) and the Unagi bowl (fresh-tasting eel and the sauce wasn't heavy). Then there were items we got today that didn't wow me: ramen, spicy tuna bowl, spicy pork bowl and the salmon skin salad. I've had better elsewhere. For some reason they went crazy with bonito flakes today. They were either cleaning their pantry or trying to conceal something in our food bowls. But there was definitely a bonito flake party!Service is better during lunch. I never have to wait long for my food the times I've been here maybe because they're more considerate of the working lunch crowd? I should come here for happy hour one of these days. Want to come with?Make sure to check-in with the mobile yelp app for the $10 off $45+ on your bill!My boyfriend and I came on a friday night around 12am and it was packed. I heard and read good things about this place so why not? Their happy hour menu is pretty good with half-off on their select nigiri and simple rolls. They had a large house sake for $4.50 during happy hour.Decor: Small, packed, loud. Clean. Kind of regret not grabbing a seat at the sushi bar! Faster service that way.We ordered a few rolls (Johnny, That's What She Say) to start. It took 30-40 minutes to get 3 rolls types. By the end of the night we had 6 rolls, house sake, and two orders of gyoza in an hour and 40 minutes.The fish was flavorful, fresh, rich, and delicious. Pretty generous on the fish as well. Presentation was beautiful. The sauces were drizzled with care on our rolls. The sushi itself tantalized our taste buds. It's a bit pricey since it's all ala carte and we know it's not all-you-can-eat. For a non-AYCE joint, we expected maybe faster service despite the quality rolls. They came out at a snail's pace that we kept getting hungry in between finishing each roll dish. We felt a bit sorry for the lone waitress doing everything from cleaning, tending to other customers, getting side dish orders etc. She was doing her best to serve everyone though. Maybe the service wouldn't have suffered as much if they had another waitress/waiter or maybe an extra chef. Don't get me wrong, we didn't expect them to come out with our order immediately, but it took FOREVER to get each one!  For the price we paid (Around $80ish by the end of the night just between the two of us), I kind of wished we chose another place. It was a delicious meal, just not-so-great timing on the sushi. I don't mind paying for sushi, but if I'm paying quite a bit extra for an ala carte place, I expected a bit better in terms of timeliness. Maybe we'll come back and try it again on less busy night.I stop into Yummy Grill regularly for Happy Hour.  They have a high standard for their fish, serve a quality products across the board, and their HH is a great value.  They also typically have a Yelp Deal going with a Check-in, though not always compatible with HH Specials. I have not explored most of the menu since I normally come for HH.  HH has a good amount of options, and one of my favorite things to order off the that menu is the Chef's Special Roll.  It changes based on what they have in at the time and also based on what other rolls you order...but it is always excellent!  They are an easy 4 stars in my book...maybe even 4.5 stars.Still the best neighborhood-feel, à la carte sushi restaurant with impressively (and consistently) delicious fish! The live scallop is my favorite - served in the shell. All plates are made with care and attention to detail, which we all know makes sushi great sushi. It is really nice to walk away from a sushi meal without feeling like your belly is about to explode from every homeward-bound pothole (e.g. the all-you-can-eat sushi experience) and Yummy Grill is the perfect place to pare back to sushi basics, simply ordering one or two selections at a time. Enjoying each bite and discussing the flavors with Chef Eric and his crew of skilled fish-slicers makes for a very civilized and satisfying meal.Love the strength of the iced green tea here. And the fish specials on the whiteboard are truly special. Note: This Yummy Grill is not to be confused with or linked to the *other* Yummy Grills in the Vegas area. This is an independently-run store with its own high-end fish purveyors, and this distinction goes way beyond the typical variance among chain franchises. One bite and you'll know you're in a very special spot!Chef Eric is one of the best sushi chefs in town!  He consistently has the absolute freshest fish in town.I started coming in to Yummy Grill for the Happy Hour.  I soon discovered the Omakase (Chef's Tasting.)  Yummy is simply the best in town...and at a price considerably less than Kabuto, Nobu, and Shibuya.  And while those are certainly much classier places with wonderful ambiance, the quality of the product is not better and any of them.You will be hard-pressed to find a place with more live options.  Fans of uni are in heaven here!If you are just getting cut rolls yummy is still a great place to go.  If you are into Nigiri, Sashimi, or Omakase then Yummy is as good as it gets!My sister asked me to have dinner with her after spending all day in the ER with my grandmother. Starving and puzzled where to gorge myself and eat my feelings. Remembering my sister lived by this great sushi place with a reverse Happy Hour, we decided to meet at Yummy Grill & Sushi.Immediately entering, I was greeted with "Moshi, moshi" by all of the staff and sat down with my sister.  Immediately a server came over, greeted us, took our drink orders, and handed us menus. We ordered the garlic edamame; the MOST delicious stuff, ever. I ordered a second round. I wanted to lick the extra sauce left over in it. I also had a bowl of their Miso Soup, excellent as well. Let's get to the sushi. Since it was happy hour (4 PM - 6 PM Sunday through Thursday/ 10 PM - 1 AM everyday),  rolls are priced as low as $2. All happy hour sushi contains 4 pieces and they aren't extra small pieces either. Our drinks arrived with a free portion of their veggie pancake. It had a nice, delicate flavor. We ordered the spicy tuna roll and avocado on top twice (if you've never tried this, do, it's heaven) and they didn't charge me extra (how RARE is that). The shrimp tempura crunch roll was divine, we ordered that twice as well. My sister got an eel roll, which she loved (I love eel sauce, just can't handle the texture. I tried it, it tasted amazing, but let her finish it). We order a Philly roll, which was yummy, you can't go wrong with creme cheese, salmon, and avocado. I especially like that it was fresh salmon. Some sushi places use salmon that has that smokey taste to it and it just ruins it for me. The garlic albacore came with the garlic sauce on the side; the sauce was so good I wanted to spoon the rest of little bowl of it like soup. The Japanese Lasagna was also AMAZING! Warm and perfect. My sister and I had about 7/8 rolls, 2 orders of that garlic edamane, and miso soup, total damage: $41 and change and we were stuffed to the gills! Our server was very attentive and answered all of my silly questions (and trust me, I have a lot of them). This particular night they had a lot of fresh seafood options, the board read: O'Toro, Blu fin Tuna from Spain, Nodokuro, Sayori, Live Uni, Scallos, Octopus Legs, Abalone, and Lobster. They have a variety of non-sushi dishes from a variety of Asian cultures. The place is small, but has a family like feel.This may be the best sushi I've ever had in Vegas and that's a huge statement because I am super, duper picky. Well done, Yummy Grill. Can't wait to go back!Best. Sushi. Ever.So simple. Given, I'm an amateurish sushi eater, but this is some of the best fish I've ever been served. The ahi, hamachi and salmon sashimi are slices of buttery goodness. On both trips here I've ordered twice, bc I just needed more. The service is quick and attentive, and I hear that Chef Eric is the man, though I haven't officially said hello to him yet :-X Know a true sushi beginner? Bring them here. They will be sold! Are you a sushi pro? Come here for some of the freshest fish in the desert.This is not the place to get rolls. Discovered that the hard way, despite reading so many reviews here that focused on the fresh nigiri and sashimi. I'll have to come back for the positive experience.Ordered take out using their website menu: seaweed salad, cherry blossom roll, paradise roll. Didn't see many rolls with salmon, and many contained tempura. Made my selection difficult, but they get a lot of reviews praising their rolls, so I figured I was safe.Inside of restaurant is kind of divey with a large bar, which I like. Service was polite and friendly from the ladies at the counter. Three sushi chefs were present and busy when I was picking up.Got home to the messy cherry blossom roll. Confession: I love sushi, but I've never had a round roll like this. Verdict: not my thing. Too reminiscent of crab salad and avocado from a country club or buffet, little to no similarity to sushi. Wish this had been noted more clearly on the menu. Or at all.t was the Paradise roll, which sounded adventurous. In my haste to find a roll with salmon, I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the fact that there was tempura shrimp AND (way too much) cream cheese AND (sweet) coconut in this roll. Verdict: again, not my thing. Very sweet and creamy roll, bearing little to no similarity to sushi. The sweetness and the cheese covered up any fish taste.Seaweed salad was flavored appropriately but dismally small: whoever packed my order accidentally put the salad in the lid rather than the bottom of the container, and space was limited.Disappointed to have a negative experience at a place so many friends and Elites love and have reviewed favorably.  Overall, the rolls themselves are TOO Americanized, to the point that proportions of flavors are off and they're no longer sushi. I'll have to revisit and order exclusively off the fresh sashimi and nigiri specials next time for a separate review.BEST OMAKASE EVER ! Thanks to Chef Eric for accommodating us for so long (oh my god it took FOUR AND A HALF HOURS) ! ! ! First and BEST omakase experience ! Omakase is a show in itself. Watching Chef Eric work his magic and show his creativity in his dishes. max points on service ! Fresh Wasabi - made into a relish. Addicting! went well with a lot of dishes but also yummy to "snack" on while waiting in between dishes. produces a fast effect to the nasal passages. has a nice, sweet flavor. #1 - Marinated Tuna on top of chopped Mountain Yam with Wasabi TobikoSaw Chef Eric chopping mountain yam. After chopping, the yam produced a "slimy" texture, similar to okra but crunchy like jicama. Yam itself was plain but paired with a marinated tuna balanced flavors very well. what a variety of textures#2 - Deep Fried Gobo/Burdock Root with dipping sauceLittle chips. Fried perfectly. Very slight starchy texture but crispy overall. Lightly sweet. Great "snack" ! #3 - Fresh Santa Barbara Sea Conch with salt/pepper/sesame oil dipping sauceVery fresh. Meat texture had a nice "bite" texture. LIGHTLY dipping the sliced conch in the sauce gives it a nice flavor. Salt helps brings out more sweetness of the conch meat#4 - Fresh Hama Hama & Shigoku OystersOne of my fears on eating raw oysters is they being not fresh, and not clean (resulting in biting into sand/shell/etc.) Two different sizes. Shigoku oysters were small and fat. Very clean and fresh. Gave a nice, creamy texture. Hama Hama oysters were much bigger, not as "fat/thick". Outer "rim" of the oyster, gave it a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture when eating. #5 - Fresh Live Scallop w/ Dried MisoServed two ways. The scallop itself was thinly sliced and sprinkled with dried miso and layered with slices of cucumber. The miso gave it a nice flavor on top of the fresh taste of the scallop. The muscle? was sliced and placed in the middle. Not chewy but gave a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture, similar to what you'd get from eating fresh geoduck sashimi #6 - Takoyaki - Deep Fried Fresh Octopus Suction CupsAt first, i thought this was calamari. But was told it was the SUCTION CUPS of an octopus leg. Lightly battered and deep fried. Crispy batter. Suction cups itself was nice and "crispy" #7 - Fresh Live Hokkaido Octopus LegThis was definitely a surprise. Aside it from having a small spot of sriracha sauce on top that gave it a little kick... i did NOT expect the octopus to be so soft and tender. Granted i dont think i've had raw octopus, especially served like this but oh man ! #8 - Fresh Live Sweet Shrimp with Black Tobiko and Uni + Deep Fried HeadThe head was deep fried. Fried pretty well. Most of it was edible, except some thicker, harder areas. The sweet shrimp itself was big. Meat texture was firm. Slightly naturally sweet. #9 - Fresh Live Santa Barbara Sea Urchin topped with a raw Quail Egg & Ikura on a bed of mixed seaweed brown riceLARGE & FAT (no joke !) pieces of sea urchin placed on top of the bed of mixed seaweed with brown rice (and other things) with a raw quail egg on top with some Ikura. The sea urchin was SUPER creamy. Mixing in the quail egg and ikura. Taking a small piece of the sea urchin and everything else. What a orchestra of flavors and textures. so delicious ! add a little fresh wasabi for even better experience !  i think this is less than $20 ala carte too ! what a deal, even normally ! #10 - Fresh Blue Fin Tuna/Chu-Toro/O-toro from Spain Nigiri Trio Made into nigiri. Chef used his special homemade soy sauce on the tuna as well ! Best blue fin tuna i've ever eaten. Very slight metallic taste. Super tender and flavorful. Chu-toro was a perfect balance of meat and fat. Melts in your mouth. O-toro (was a little disappointing due to the pieces of chewy parts (tendons?) which req' the chef to slice and arrange it differently). Super fatty. Would have liked the chef to quickly torch the top to bring out the aroma and flavor of the fat even more. #11 - Fresh Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna with Fried OnionsSliced tuna. Add a few onions to the middle, on top of the sliced chili, wrap it around and enjoy. plethora of flavors on top of the nice sauce it was sitting in. Chili adds a little small kick to it all#12 - Torch Seared Wagyu Beef with Uni, Ikura, and chopped ShallotsSuper tender! Roll it around to "encase" the uni and ikura. Opposite side of beef still raw. variation of beef tataki. #13 - Fresh Kohada (Spotted Sardine) First time trying kohada ! always wanted to try ! strong flavor with a little sourness (similar to mackerel) #14 - Fresh Australian Ocean Trout and New Zealand King SalmonTrout tastes crisper, less fatty than salmon. Both orange meat. Simple and clean. #15 - Fresh Blue Fin O-Toro SashimiTHAT MARBLING ! Super tender. A5 Wagyu of the Sea. #16 - Unagi topped with avocado and bonito flakesSimple but delicious unagi nigiri#17 - Green Tea Ice Cream1st floral tasting and aromatic green tea EVERWith the high reviews I really wanted to love this place. I did and I kept coming back hoping things would change with the customer service and wait time for food but it never did. See the end of my review for why. The first time we came for happy hour and got huge slices of fish, very generous. We then went back again and this time the fish slices were literally cut in half the size it was the first time, service was sllllllooooowww and we had to ask for them to check on things, ask for water refills, but my main gripe was that the fish slice reduced in half. I would appreciate them keeping things fairly consistent if it's large slices or small, either way I know what I would get. I do like the quality of the fish and so I would always try to convince my hubby to come back and each time I literally had to convince my husband that things would get better in terms of the wait time for food. Sometimes we just don't have 2 1/2 -3 hours to wait for our food. We came here once on a major holiday and once on my birthday so that shows you how much I really liked their fish but I started to feel like I was just being hopeful by keep coming back, hoping things would get better. We also came about 5 other times. The last visit was my most memorable in a bad way. We ordered tuna (regular) on the first order and had a conversation with our waitress and she told us how blue fin tuna was much better and we should get it. We said we would think about it. She said if you order all of our different types of tunas and have them side by side and compare taste you would notice the difference. We then later added in blue fin tuna (with a different waitress because ours was too busy to talk to us for about the 10 minutes we tried flagging her down). The regular tuna arrived at the table. We were hoping to get them together but after waiting and waiting we never got the blue fin, so we just ate that first tuna (regular).  More waiting and waiting and got some other orders, we got another plate of tuna. It looked exactly the same as the first. But what do we know, maybe it was different.  It tasted the same as the first. We were confused. We asked our waitress why it tasted exactly the same (when she claimed they tasted different) and she went to go check on it and after some long conversations with the sushi chef and waitresses she came back and said that I had ordered another order of regular tuna. I said no we ordered the blue fin tuna per your suggestion. We weren't impressed with the regular tuna and that is why we ordered the blue fin. She kept insisting that I ordered the regular and I kept insisting I did not, because that is true. This went on with her talking about it with Eric the sushi chef/Owner? and the 2 waitresses involved. It started to get uncomfortable for me watching it all. She then comes back and says if you want to order it, it's past the happy hour time but we can offer it at the happy hour price. Ummmm, no thanks. I already ordered it before (an hour ago), we are done eating, already spent over $100, and so over it at this point. Why not just bring us the correct tuna that I ordered??? Especially since they know us by face, Eric even came over and said he recognized us when I mentioned that we have been here many times. It just upset me that they made such a BIG deal about it, instead of just giving me what I ordered, the waitress insisted I was WRONG and made it known, making for a really awkward "date night" with my husband. It was also the waitress that kept saying there is nothing she can do, it's not her restaurant and she is sorry but that is the decision. She kept apologizing for what happened, but like I said we were done eating and just ready to go, not wanting to argue over fish. The owner could see us talking and he finally came over long after we had already been talking about this for an extended period of time which I just wanted wanted to drop it at this point. I expect more from a place with high reviews and wish he would have taken the matter into his hands from the start once he realized there was a problem. In the end he removed the second order of regular tuna and made it seem like he was accommodating us. It was the right thing to do, but we still never got the blue fin tuna we ordered. To each his own and he is the owner, if he feels this is how to treat regular customers, that is his choice. Unfortunately after coming here regularly for about a year, we decided that we want to feel a little more appreciated as customers. I think the problem could have been fixed quickly even if the waitress did not admit it was her fault instead of dragging it out and making for an uncomfortable dining out experience. The fish is 4 stars (5 stars taste, 4 stars size of nigiri). The customer service to me is 0 stars.Came in for happy hour yesterday with a friend and wow! Items ordered:-Cucumber salad; soy sauce & sesame seeds ($2.50)-Baked California roll; crab, avocado, yum yum sauce ($3) -Japanese Lasagna Roll; crab, cream cheese, avocado, yum yum & eel sauce ($4.50)I wasn't very hungry since I had already eaten, but since I had never tried Yummy's, I figured I could make a little bit of room in my belly. The cucumber salad had a different taste than what I'm used to but it was still good, the salad does not come with crab automatically, you have to ask for some, so I will remember that for next time. There is an additional charge ($5) for crab or shrimp, whichever you'd prefer. The rolls were both very good. I'm also not really a fan of baked rolls but these were good, specially the Japanese lasagna. I'm not really a big fan of having cream cheese in rolls since most places tend to make the cream cheese taste too overpowering, but not here, the balance was perfect! The restaurant itself is on the small side, but not uncomfortable small. The waiters were all very nice and friendly. Service was quick, we were in and out in 30 minutes. Now I wish they were closer to me, but the drive from the southwest side of town wasn't too bad.OBSESSED OBSESSED!Sorry but I'm obsessed and the experience here just keeps on getting better and better...  the fact that they remeber me through yelp is even more of a graditude and SERVICE seriously can't express it enough on how much they wow me.I always go only to have a little taster of stuff but it's so good that I just can't stop eating... always go in telling myself I will only get a few things! But I lie to myself every time!PEOPLE!! I don't mean to hype this place up so much but seriously got to give them a try! Better than anything you could get on the strip I would have to say... But i ALWAYS try a new place with no expectations... so if you do go in try everything that sounds good to you!I know this joint has a ton of reviews, but after dining here so many times over the last few years, they deserve another 5 stars. This place is the best up North. THE BEST! We love us some good sushi and there are quite a few places to go to in town. If you're up in the NW corner, try this place out.It's great for lunch, dinner and late night. We come here pretty regularly when we want sushi and it has yet to disappoint us. They want their customers to know that they have fresh fish flown in 3 times a week and more if needed. They even bring out eel, fish and whatever to show the clients how fresh their meal is going to be. Honestly, I could do without. But it's still pretty cool for some people, I suppose. We LOVE getting the Kobe roll here. That's very American, but good god...it's amazing. Also, the yellowtail here is always amazing. Everything we've had there, we've loved. The service is always great and the sushi chefs are super friendly and always very helpful. If you give them an idea of what you like, they're always happy to make a creation for you. LOVE this place!HH is awesome for those who enjoy fresh nigiri and a tastefully dressed salad like myself. Couldn't think of much else I'd want on the HH menu so I had them make me a specialty roll which included salmon, eel, shrimp tempura, cream cheese And avocado (all of my favorite things ) I'm coming back for HH for sure!

Review Text :
I was so pumped to check this place out after I found it by complete accident. I read up on it and was really intrigued by the history behind the place and how this might be one of the oldest restaurants in Phoenix (they must be doing something right, yeah?) as well as being the only thing standing from the city's historic Chinatown. But, seriously, this place did not live up to anything to any of my expectations.Now I know some might argue that this place serves American Chinese cuisine, and that's true. However, this is some of the nastiest Chinese food I've ever had. Some might complain about the decor, but I actually kinda liked it. I felt like I was in a Jarmusch movie so I'll give the place some points for that. As much as I'm into dives, this is a little bit higher than a place I ate called Won Kok which I am convinced is the butthole of Los Angeles' Chinatown. To be honest, all I that had at Sing High was the chow mein and the wonton soup. The wonton soup was just old cabbage boiled in water and the chow mein was just a plate of oily noodles. Needless to say, I felt like I was giving birth to the Antichrist a few hours later.Go to Sing High for the experience of saying you were there, but keep your mouth closed at all costs.If you happen to come across this little hole in the wall. The thought might pop into your head that this will be one of those great hidden gems. Well let me tell you know. Its not.According to my mother it used to be amazing a decade ago. But no longer. To be fair the gigantic hole in the ceiling right before you enter should have been our first clue. But it was almost 6pm and I hadn't eaten all day. Not to mention I've eaten amazing food in way shadier places. So we went in. The place is roomy, lots of parking and places to sit. But the decor mixed with the soft jazz they play is reminiscent of an old school gangster film. I spent my whole meal waiting for Sollozzo and McCluskey to meet their end.As for the food. I was shocked there was so little vegeterian friendly options. Which lead me to order an awkward looking plate of vegetables and chow mein. What it really was a can of hard noodles under a mix of onions and bean sprouts. With a mystery flavorless white sauce drenched through out. My not vegeterian associate got the sweet and sour shrimp. Which was ridiculously over battered. I was so hungry and disatiasfied with my meal I found myself eating her leftover batter. Which still had a bit of sweet and sour sauce on it. The sauce was probably the only redeeming factor food wise. We did have a nice and fast waitress.Long story short, I ate a grilled cheese when I got home.

Restaurant name  Riccio's Italian Restaurant

Review Text :
So happy to have Riccio's in the Touchstone neighborhood. You know the movies or TV shows with the local pizza joint that families always go to after soccer games or church? Enter Riccio's. It may be a little hard to locate in the corner of the shopping center off of Baybrook, but once you find it, it's easy to tell it's a gem. A quaint interior with tables and booths and plenty of smiling faces. My wife and I stumbled in to pick up a pizza and garlic knots. The service was so fast! Ready in less than 15 minutes!Let me take this opportunity to blow your mind. Eggplant Parmesan pizza. Yes. Commence drooling. Fried eggplant, marinara and gratuitous amounts of mozz on a pizza. Holy cow. Amazing. Chewy eggplant with a light layer of seasoned breading. The garlic knots were the best I've had to date. Not coated in grease like so many other places. Dusted with garlic powder and finishes with a welcoming chew. The dough is wonderful. Great for sopping up extra marinara!So happy to have finally visited Riccio's! Can't wait to head back to our new little neighborhood pizza place!I have known for quite a while that Riccios was tucked away in the Touchstone shopping center  (along with Tuesday Morning and the Touchstone Yellow Rose) but haven't bothered going before now because I thought it was just another super casual pizza joint. So, when we saw the recent Groupon deal, we decided to go and check it out.  Needless to say, we were suprised when we walked in the door last Friday night and found the place jam-packed with people.  It was standing room only! However, Ricky found a spot for us to have a seat on some barstools back by the kitchen while we waited .  We waited no more than 5 -10 minutes and then were taken to our table.We decided to start with an order of calamari and garlic knots.  The calamari was breaded and cooked just right - not rubbery or chewy. The marinara sauce was fresh and tasty.  The garlic knots were seasoned to perfection and quite tasty.  Our server was very helpful in answering our questions about various menu items. It was a tough decision though because they had a nice selection of pastas, pizzas, and entree favs like chicken parm, chicken marsala, eggplant parm, etc.I was really torn between the vegetable lasagna and the Tortolloni Bellagio.  I ended up with the tortelloni which was served in a cream sauce with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, and chicken (around $15).  It was very good, but rather rich, so next time I think I'll check out the veggie lasagna or one of the pizzas.  (I saw several other tables with pizzas that looked really good.) Other people in my party ordered veal marsala (around $18), chicken parm (around $16), and chicken francaise (around $16).  I thought the chicken parm & chicken francaise (similar to chicken piccata) both looked good. Since I don't eat veal, I thought that dish looked icky. ;-)  One of our friends had a birthday so we ordered a dessert to share and of course, had to go with the tiramisu. It was good - perfect texture and flavor. Overall, I was pleasantly suprised about our entire experience here. The food was good, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was friendly & comfy.  We ended up spending a little more than expected we would (the bill came to around $100 before tip for 4 entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert, and 3 beers) but the place was still reasonably priced.  We are definitely looking forward to our next visit.Ricky came by to chat with us and we found out this is the same Riccios that was originally in Myers Park (started by Ricky's family) and then was over at Strawberry Hill for a while.  Long time Charlotteans may remember Riccios from one of the previous locations.  In any case, we hope they stay in this location for a long, long time!  Oh, and as a bonus, we found out they deliver to our neighborhood, so SCORE for those nights when we're too lazy to cook or go out!Riccio's has been a tradition for my husband and I for as long as we have been together (almost 10 years). When Touchstone Village used to have a Food Lion in it, and a video store, he lived in the neighborhood behind it, and would walk from his house. Cue his current best friend that moved in 2 doors down when he was 7 and they would ride their bikes up there every weekend. Needless to say, our group of 4 is recognized when we come in. I know the original two waitresses have literally watched my husband and his friend grow up, and consistently order the same thing (garlic knots, house salads, and pizza). Even now we still order the same garlic knots, salad, and pizza, albeit our group is a bit larger. The food has never disappointed. The salads are always "the best house salads" ever, and the pizza is always fresh from the oven in less than 15 minutes even with a packed house. Although with recent renovations, the place has grown, and had a face lift this is still the family restaurant we have known and loved for years. You are always greeted with a smile, the owner will always be there and converse with every table, and you will always leave full and satisfied.

Review Text :
I am rarely voluntarily away from Vegas for long. Sure there are those times that the state wishes I occupy one of their rooms for 3 to 6 years, but we have all had those times.  I came back for my birthday and I visited many of my old haunts. I was longing for nostalgia. I was longing for strong drink. I was longing for weak companionship. I hit many of my favorite places...and the Tap House was one of them.I longed to play shuffleboard, drink beers and listen to good music. When I am near Summerlin there is only one place I go to. So I swung into the bar around midnight and spend the rest of the night throwing back drinks with friends. The pizza was half price and that was just right for us. We tried three of the pizzas and they were amazing. I also had to order my favorite Chicken Parmigiana. It was as wonderful as usual. Right next door used to be a Las Vegas institution called Fellini's.  They have since moved their restaurant to the Sun Coast Casino to ply their trade. The good news is that they still deliver their freshly made sauces and they are amazing as always.  So you basically get to eat the same food for half the price and get reasonable priced drinks.The bartender knew it was my birthday and comped me drinks and was totally cool. He treated Rex like the way Rex demands to be treated. It is important to treat Rex well...and he knew that. He could see it in the eyes.I want to address the smoking issue one person brought up...and I will say...grow up!  People smoke in bars...but very rarely do they get to smoke in a place with a great shuffleboard table and amazing food.I have removed one star because they have a crappy jukebox that plays edited songs. Ridiculous. Good music on there but not all the songs you would want. Go. Go often. Drink. Drink to Rex. You always should.I rarely make it up to this side of town but my husband and I were headed to Plant World and needed to have some lunch before we got our shopping started. From the outside, The Tap House isn't anything exceptional but over the years I have learned that sometimes these dive looking places serve up great food at really reasonable prices. Little did we know that pizzas were half off on Saturdays until we were already seated and trying to decide if we should get one to split, or order separately.  It was like fate, how could we decide on anything else when the pizza was half priced? We ended up with the thin-crust veggie pizza, with olives on only half, plus banana peppers. We also split an antipasto salad.To drink, had a jager bomb, which was just $4.50, and I had the option of regular or sugar free Red Bull. In a town where some places charge $5 or more for just a Red Bull, this is a great deal. Great deals mean nothing if the food sucks. This food did not suck. The antipasto salad was good sized with plenty of meat, and the pizza was cooked perfectly and loaded with toppings. If I lived in the area, I could see myself going to The Tap House often for dinner or just drinks.THAT was a fantastic pizza!!! $12 for a large "Fellini" topped with sausage, mushrooms, salami, peppers and olives definitely hit the spot.  All the pizzas are done in a pan which made the Fellini taste like a homemade Pizza Hut supreme.  I haven't been to another spot in LV that does it quite like this and it'll be the best reason to come back.There were definitely some minuses like the smokiness and I felt like the whole area was lacking sufficient lighting.  So if you're trying to lay low and avoid people that may be looking for you (manhunts, warrants, ex-spouses, Rent A Center)) this place will do the trick....unless they happen to be a Cleveland Browns fan.  I think this is one of two Browns bars in Vegas.  So when are they erecting the Brian Hoyer statue upfront? (Edit: Hoyer tore his ACL a week after this review ending his season) Speaking of football, we were there catching the second half of the Monday night game (Broncos vs Raiders) when music started kicking in from the other room.  Their "Monday Nites Jamming" was rocking.  The whole room on the other side was packed with people by 8pm partying like it was 1979.  I was impressed.  They also offer daily specials like burger and a beer Mondays but it's got to be all about their pizza!!  Half price pizzas all day Saturdays/Sundays and after midnight!

Review Text :
Holy tap-dancing Christo!  This place is, "Is that a solar system in your restaurant? Because your food is out of this world good."  To preface, I went into this day a little tired and completely unaware of what was going to happen.  A friend recommended we mix up our normal Sunday routine of the Flying Biscuit and try out Fenwick's.... Which most people had never heard of - but this guy is cute and has great taste so sure, we were on board.  I've probably driven by this restaurant well over 50 times and never thought anything of it.  It's kind of like the girl next store... adorable and unassuming, but then you get one taste and boom! You're hooked.  Let's start by saying that we had a group of 16 people and this place probably seats 25-30 MAX.  We walked in without any reservations or heads up and they were all smiles and let us rearrange their restaurant at our leisure.  Some customers even moved seats to make more room - amazing.  From the moment we sat down service was attentive and friendly and constantly throughout the meal our group kept saying "I feel like they care about me" or "I feel like I'm at home."  What better compliment can you give?But here's the cincher - the FOOD.  There were about 6 specials that our waitress told us about - all of them which made me drool.   I had to go with the (WAIT FOR IT)......... Nutella stuffed, Captain Crunch rolled, Brioche covered in chocolate and bananas.  WHAT!?  Somebody pinch me, did she say Captain Crunch AND Nutella?!  So that was an obvious hit...over the fence world series kind of thing.  But out of the 16 people in our group everyone got a pretty varied menu: omelets, quiche, benedict, breakfast specials, caramel apple pancakes, banana foster pancakes, grits, etc.   Group consensus?  Absolutely 100% yes I would do that again and pay twice the price it was so good.So overall, you should probably stop whatever you're doing, quit your job and see if you can live in Fenwick's.  Top 5 places in Charlotte.  My 2013 challenge?  Try everything on Fenwick's menu.  Amen to this place, Love at first taste.Fenwick's is celebrating their 30th Anniversary! Congrats! This cozy family operated restaurant is conveniently located on the 500 block of Providence Road . The brunch here is very popular and there are always daily specials on the menu board!Recently I got to sample their menu with some friends.For appetizers, the hummus and onion rings are good, but the wings are best. Just the perfect crunch on the outside and tender inside, covered in a flavorful, killer sauce.All of the entrees were delicious. The Salmon Filet portion on the salad was enormous! The standouts were definitely the London Broil plate and the Chicken Breast covered in creamy, cheesy goodness.The best part was hands down the desserts! Whoa! Probably the best Key Lime pie I've ever had! The VCR, a vanilla custard with raspberry sauce and fresh strawberries was pretty amazing too!

Review Text :
How much fun is this place?!?  I'll tell you.  It's loads of fun.  First things first: a big thank you to Pitt Yelper Kat M. for suggesting husband and I come here on our trip to the 'Burgh.  You were right, we loved Church Brew Works!If you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.]For two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.  Our brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.  Aaaaa-men.This restaurant ruined my New Year's Eve! My husband and I made a reservation for 10pm, thinking it would be a fun place to be at midnight - we were wrong. We were told we had the table for 2 hours, and there were all sorts of rules about how you couldn't cancel or be late or else they'd charge you. We were a few minutes early, and pretty much the first thing our server said to us when we sat down was, "Our kitchen is about to close." Why they take reservations for 10pm if that's when the kitchen closes, I can't imagine. So, we quickly put in our order (we both wanted their special New Year's Eve 3 course prix fixe menu), and continued to be rushed through the entire meal. The appetizer was disappointing - my husband ordered Fried Goat Cheese and the portion was so teeny tiny; the cheese pieces were about the size of a dime. I had the Cioppino, which was supposed to be mussels, scallops, and shrimp in a lobster-saffron broth. There was no shrimp, and the mussels and scallops were so miniature that they had no flavor whatsoever. The broth and garlic bread were good.While we were still eating our appetizers they brought out the soup/salad course, which is so rude and made us feel rushed. My husband's Lobster Bisque was good, but again, very small portion. I had the Roasted Cauliflower Salad, which turned out to be an arugula salad, garnished with a few small shavings of cauliflower.Again, while we were still eating our soup/salad, they brought out our entree, and by that time we were pretty annoyed and asked if they could keep the entrees hot while we finished our current course. Our server was visibly impatient/annoyed and said that her manager didn't want our entrees in the window, but agreed to bring them back anyway. When we were finished and she brought our entrees back out they were lukewarm. The flavors were good, but would have been much better if prepared/served at the appropriate time.Then we asked to see the dessert menu and our server said no, the kitchen is closed. We asked to speak to the manager. Miraculously, the kitchen was not actually closed. We had dessert - my Malted Bread Pudding was good, but my husband's Carrot Cake was way too gingery.Through each course, the staff was cleaning around us, making us feel even more rushed, and we couldn't even have a normal conversation because they were hovering so much. Our server was acting like she couldn't wait for us to leave.When we were finished and it was time to pay, the manager finally came out. He glazed over the whole issue and did not listen to our complaints. By that time we felt so unwelcomed, we just wanted to get out of there. So, we were actually driving home when the clock struck midnight. So disappointing!I don't know how this place would be on a regular night, but I definitely would stay away from it on any sort of special occasion. I am just shocked by how unprofessional they were on every level.Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.   I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers) After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.Oh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.   First and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.   There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business.

Restaurant name  Isabela On Grandview

Review Text :
Isabella's is a diva well past her prime.  When you're driving up to a restaurant and there's a ten-foot-long banner on the side that says, "Pittsburgh's Most Romantic Restaurant 2010," you know you're in trouble (nothing says romantic quite like a giant sign that says, "Romantic"). It's true the view of downtown PGH is sweeping, but the dining room felt like it was a set from the movie Network or American Psycho: time has not been kind to classy 80's interior design.Okay, the service. When our waitress first came over she asked if we wanted to hear "the restaurant's story." My dining companion had already been there and I honestly wasn't that interested. After saying we were good on the story she said, "Well, let me tell you anyway."And that she did; it was long-winded (the chefs cooked other places, they now cook here, etc.) and pretty boring. Throughout the rest of the meal we had to ask for water refills repeatedly and she didn't clear empty plates for ten minutes. However, she did manage to do a fancy fold on my companion's napkin the second he went to the bathroom. Whatever you do, don't let the napkin rest on the chair for even a moment! I don't know, it was like she took a Saturday morning high-end service class but got high right beforehand.Whoever conceived the menu at Isabela's knew what they were doing, but whoever they entrusted to execute it doesn't. The prix fixe menu is 7 courses ($70 per person) and you definitely get your money's worth if you're measuring in quantity: both of us were stuffed by the end of the meal. But if you're measuring by quality of food I'd say no. The shrimp soup was just a failure (the base was waaaayyyy too tangy to make sense), the steak and potatoes were doable and the ricotta cheese cake had oddly squishy bits of almonds crunch in it. The squid and octopus entree was creamy and remarkably delicious.If you find yourself here on a first date (as I did), or worse, if someone you've been with for any significant amount of time thinks you should spend your anniversary here, be sure to split a bottle of wine: it'll put a warm gloss on things.

Everyone I know around here eats at Roberto's, they deliver and it is prob the best Mexican fast food in the near vicinity other than my Mom's cooking of course! Now I dont eat meat so when they can accommodate me with w/e the effffff I want and however picky my high maintenance self can get, well they get kudos in my book! They make a mean Chile Relleno Burro you can put w/e you want in it crema, pico, rice, beans they will customize it for you no prob. This is my fav relleno place on this side of town period! Dont forget the Horchata!We live in the general area and have been here several times before and after the DDD show. They always have good food. Always. We had 3x bean and cheese burritos, 1x shredded beef taco and 1x chili releno ,meal with rice and beans. I could only eat one chili and some rice and beans. That thing was good. The burritos an d taco were devoured by the rest of the family with hardly any speaking. That is a feat in my house. (3 girls) I heart Robertos.

Review Text :
Omit the U and we finally have Charlotte's first O(fficial) YE. Yeah buddy! Some say eclectic, but I prefer eccentric (like me!). Comet Grill really embodies what a neighborhood dive should be. It's the type of bar that established the counterculture which made dive bars hip and trendy. This is the type of place where the locals run, and not because it's the talk of the town, but because it's real, original, and unique. There is nothing superficial about it; no glamor or glitz here. It's just a great place to enjoy drinks and food with good company. I didn't grab any food, but the rumor is, everything is tasty. Everything is made in house, so you know there must be some love attached to it. As others mentioned, AC is incredibly underrated. It wasn't a packed house, but still insanely hot. "Heat rises" so avoid the second story in the summer months. I debated on 3 or 4 stars because of the heat index, and while 3.5 is more deserving.....eff it. The bartender was really nice and walked the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail up and down the stairs for us. Now you heard it before, but I'll say it again. $1 PBRs on Thursdays. That's cheaper than bottled water!Local, local, local. Great little bar with good food and cold brews. It's a small place but with lots of character. I've been here a few times for lunch. The Reuben is fantastic, so are their hot dogs. Haven't tried the burgers yet. Friendly place with lots of local regulars located on Park Rd in the Dilworth area. It's worth a stop.

Can't say that I've been jonesin' to check out RR. Sure, it's a convenient location and easy lunchtime middle-ground for different professions. You can see the "ladies who lunch" crowd here or even the dude in his power suit ready to "rock" a deal with a client. Can't say you'll see too much wowing going on from the food perspective. I came here for lunch with a friend since it was the most convenient location for both of us. Ended up ordering a salad with rare, seared tuna and the light balsamic dressing. I've been on a kick of lighter lunch options lately and Red Rocks' salad options fit the bill rather well. Our server was....friendly, but seemed a little perturbed when we presented a coupon. Not a huge deal, but just something to keep in mind. Would I go back? Sure. Am I rushing back to excavate the rest of the menu for something worthwhile? Nope.

Review Text :
The interactions of office workers are a model for society at large; well-meaning, well-mannered individuals combine to form mindless, tactless mobs. This goes double for the IT business, where college-educated scholars emerge from their offices to congregate in basement computer labs to reclaim their primal triviality. Passive aggressive intellectuals become territorial Luddites; arguments erupt over whose iPod is played over the speakers, whether to lift tables or drag them across the carpet, and whether or not making fun of my toe nail polish counted as gender discrimination.When it came time for lunch, a caucus of Neanderthal-like rumbling came from our throats. Moments ago, we had all been connoisseurs of fine cuisine. But suddenly we clamored for culture-less layman food. Burgers. Subs. No. Pizza. PIZZA! PIZZA! WE WANT PIZZA! ORDER THE PIZZA GODDAMIT!"Well, what pizza should we get?"Pizza by Napoli. No, I don't like their crusts. Well, how about Pullano's? No. Too greasy. My sensitive tummy can't handle it. "How about Barro's?"What is this 'Barro's"? Is it deep dish? Is it New York Style? "I really like it."Well fine. But what should we put on it? Sausage. No. Extra cheese, I'm a vegetarian. No. Pineapple. Nobody likes pineapple, shut up. Pepperoni. Yes. Pepperoni. PEPPERONI!A half hour later...I like this Barro's, don't you? Yes. It's deep dish, but it's crispy. The crust is just the right amount of thickness. The toppings are generous, and there is plenty of cheese. Just good and bland enough to reach the status quo. We all approve. Hooray Barro's! This was a good lunch! Good job, whoever suggested this?As soon as lunch was over, someone was hit in the face with a chair. Your tax dollars at work.Many people don't know it, but even though Barro's is a chain you'll see in various locations, it's a LOCAL chain, family owned and operated.They established here in Phoenix circa 1984 (i think it was) and have grown and expanded all over AZ quite successfully ever since.The best pizza in town, even if service is a little inconsistent.

Review Text :
Holy happy hour specials, Batman!Bookmarked this place for their HH: 4-6PM, half off tapas and $2 off wine or beer.Restaurant interior is more upscale than I expected.Menu is fairly diverse with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options indicated with symbols. Tapas menu has several Mediterranean options, there are a bunch of salads, and of course, there's pizza- if you join their mailing list, you'll get a coupon to try a pizza for free (dine in only, with purchase).BF and I were here for a light early dinner, got 3 tapas and a beer.FIG & GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD: Yum, 4-slice portion with good balance of flavors from the sweet figs, salty cheese, and mild spinach, as well as a bit of pork? Adding a sprinkle of red pepper kicked it up a notch.PARMESAN STUFFED ARTICHOKES: Good lord these were the table favorite, served in a blanket of parmesan crumbs with a cup of dipping sauce. 'Chokes had crunch and flavor, herb coating was light and complemented the cheese inside, which was mild instead of overpowering (as done elsewhere).DUCK MINI TACOS: An order of 6 mini tacos, filled with 24-hour-marinated duck topped with cilantro, tomatoes, feta, and sour cream, HH pricing at just over $5? Amazeballs. I never would have combined duck and feta, but I love them both and here everything worked so well together in this dish. Fresh and flavorful!Only thing that detracted from my visit was the service: entered and stood by hostess stand for quite a while before being acknowledged, and our server had way too many tables to herself and was quite frazzled. This was frustrating because there were easily 8 employees present, but I guess maybe they weren't on the clock yet? As 6 o'clock got closer, business picked up and the three women mobbing the hostess stand eventually started picking up the slack.Normally I'd dock a star for this, but despite being overwhelmed our server was polite and our food came out quickly, and was amazing.Fabulous food, phenomenal happy hour.  Even with a beer, total before tip was under $20. Will be coming back to try more!

Restaurant name  Mi Patio

Review Text :
Mi Patio es su patio. While there actually is not a patio at Mi Patio there is standard Mexican fare (with a little Greek flare I might add) that is a step up from other local Mexican restaurants. My Chef took me there (I mean, he's a chef, the place is bound to rock my guacamole) and they seemed to know him. Lovin' the "Norm!" a la Cheers kinda thing when I go out with John. Interior was brightly lit, not a piece of black wraught iron in sight. Colorful parrots hang from the ceiling. Oh, did I say they're not real. Clay I believe. Anyway the food. That's why we're here. I had such a hankering for Huevos Rancheros I couldn't pass it up. Served with a chunky ranchera sauce over two corn tortillas along with some fantastic beans and passable rice, I was a happy Tomasito. Homemade flour tortillas are served along with the meal and they were dee lish. John had a combo plate with an enchilada in a savory and medium spiced red sauce with a serving a skirt steak. I thought that was cool. A combo plate where you can get a piece o meat. The guacamole, chips and salsa were all on my A list.I will tell you exactly why this place is so great.This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.  Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle.Say "Nah" Like the famous sunglasses kid, "Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot."  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (He's a Chump.  "You sir, command that fish into this taco."). Short list of amazing things to be had here:1. Margaritas.2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it?3. The Chips and Salsa 4. Chicken Tacos.  5.  Ice Tea. 6. PacificoI have a simple life, big and small, soft and crispy, full of obvious contradictions and some surprising incarnations. The life of a tortilla is much like anyone else full of glamour, large family drama and constant transformation. I'd like to share that story with you here today, my life as a tortilla.Ever since being a young kernel of corn I've know I was different from the rest of the ear. While the other kernels longed to be cereal and ethanol, I knew that I wanted to be a star. Celebrated each and every day, giving promise of a brighter and tastier future. Then it happened, I was suddenly plucked, mashed, rolled and pressed, being transformed from the ugly duckling into the beautiful swan I always knew I was. Destined for greatness in the kitchen of Mi Patio, I knew it was all coming true for I am the corn tortilla.From the second you walk in the door of my home, you can sense my presence. Bold colors, comfortable seating and smiling faces were all there to celebrate my life and times. As soon as you are seated a hot, lightly salty and crispy bowl of me is sat onto the table. They've cut me into triangles so I'm easier to handle, then I'm deep-fried golden and simply beautiful. My 2 friends, Mild and Spicy, are a couple of salsas that love to hang out all over me. Go ahead, grab me and dip me deep into one of them, slather me in their tomato goodness, I deserve it as much as you do. I have another friend, the cold and refreshing Margarita ($1.75), who simply completes me. Enjoy them slowly while the wandering minstrels play requests from my motherland of Mexico, this would bring a joyful tear to me eye, if I had one.On the menu you can find many of my brothers, sisters and cousins. My cousin Quesapilla ($6.35) is a real show off though his beginnings are quite humble. Some also call him native fry bread but I just call him a crowd pleasure. Stuffed with gobs of cheese and griddled until melted and bubbly, he tastes just as good as he looks. Spoon on some fresh pico de gallo and you'll see why the ladies swoon and the men groom. My sister from another mother, Quesadilla ($5.95) is a total sweetheart. She's wide, thin and crispy all covered with cheese and I mean that in the nicest possible way. She, Mild and Spicy have a triad relationship, all complementing one another in each melted bite.Baja Chicken Burro ($8.35) is one of my favorite uncles. He's the uncle who shows up delicious and golden brown, draped in an outrageous creamy coat of sour cream and cilantro, Id have to say he is all about glamour and fashion. Much like season 1 of Project Runway where Jay McCarroll and Wendy Pepper would cat fight every single week, my uncle Baja simply does not get along with auntie Huevos Rancheros ($8.35), a snide but delicious bitch. Her fluffy eggs are perfectly cooked, her delicious Ranchero sauce and her rice and beans make for a satisfying anytime platter.Not liking to sound like a total me-me, I do have to say that I taste pretty good wrapped around Carne Asada con Pico de Gallo ($11.75). Tender steak grilled to a nice medium and served with pico de gallo, rice and beans. All you have to do is fill me up with some of your juicy meat and it's a win-win scenario. I get to soak up your meat juice and you get to eat all 6" of my round deliciousness.Every family has a black sheep and mine is no exception. Coming from a Greek father and a Mexican mother, Gyros Chimi ($8.50), is one of mystery and excitement. Inside she is full of tender slices of roasted gyro meat, gently deep fried then she's covered in the perfect accessory, creamy cucumber sauce. To add to her difference she is served with a hearty baked zucchini complete with sliced onion and a rich tomato sauce. You'll have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you take your first bite, delish.Unlike auntie Huevos, the Chorizo and Egg Burro ($6.55), is tasty and uncomplicated. Any chance I get to soak in sauce I'm so there! Try the #106 Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice & Beans ($8.55) for a celebration of soak. Stuffed with cheese then covered in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce I taste real good if I can say so myself. I also enjoy being bent over, deep-fried then filled with beef and topped with lettuce and tomatoes. One bite into my crunchy exterior exposes my goods for you to enjoy completely.I'm a firm believer that a meal is never complete without something sugary, it doesn't have to be too big. Fry bread with Cinnamon & Honey ($3.25) is sticky and sweet cousin of mine, who I like to call Fannie. Like my other cousin Quesapilla, she's golden brown, chewy and drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. After tasting Fannie, you might wonder why you've never given her a taste before?Now that I've been able to share so much of myself with you here today, I feel a great peace and inner joy that can only be brought out by my loyal fans. In whatever form I take from a taco to a warm steamy basket know this, I am here for u.What do you know, I went back!  The owner was kind enough to email me a while back and we discussed what it was I was unhappy with, he gave me some recommendations based on my tastes, and he sent me a gift certificate to try them out again.  This time around, instead of a dismal one star rating, I find myself wavering between 3 and 4.  I will clarify that I would like to give this place 3.5 but I am rounding up because I have never had chicken as juicy as I did the other night in my entire life.The husband and I stopped by here right after work, at about 4, and there were a handful of tables already full.  As the time progressed, it became much busier.  I would also like to report that the strong artificial cherry port-a-potty smell I picked up on last time is no longer there.  All I smelled was the food.  We seated ourselves, I glanced over the menu, and I knew what I was going to order.  Thanks to reviews from nathan and Amber, I ordered the quesapilla as an app, and for my entree, I went with the Baja Chicken Burro per the owner's suggestion.The Quesapilla came out quickly and was already oozing cheese.  I cut it open to share and I couldn't help but stare and watch the cheese slowly fall out.  It was like porn to me.  I have an addiction to food porn.  The taste of it was fantastic.  The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.  The Baja Chicken Burro (a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked, then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce) was delicious.  The outside was perfectly crisp, there was just enough cheese, and the cream cheese sauce was perfect!  I was nervous about the sauce because I am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but this was really great.  It was slightly spicy with a really nice cooling effect because of the dairy.  The chicken was incredible.  It was so juicy and so flavorful I thought I might have a foodgasm.  I can't believe I am saying that about Mexican food, but it's true.  They know their chicken.Overall, the food was fantastic, much better this time, but the service was okay.  It started off really strong with our drinks coming immediately after we ordered them, and subsequently our food, but after we finished we were left waiting about 20 or so minutes just to get our check.  I also couldn't help but notice while we were waiting, that this place seems to be so friendly.  The owner knew so many of the customers by name and was genuinely interested in their lives.  It was refreshing to see that kind of friendliness.  I take back my original review, it was very clearly an off day.  My husband and I very much enjoyed our food this time around.  Next time I have a taste for Mexican food (probably next cinco de mayo week) I will think about stopping by again.the scene: san francisco girl fondly accustomed to cold and foggy summer days takes on a seemingly endless road trip to the fiery hell pits of arizona. desperately in search of good mexican food. i never realized how much i hated being in cars until i took a road trip with my mom and dad a month ago. it's not my parents fault, i love hanging out with them. they're hilarious. only my dad can take a boring 15 minute story and turn it into an exciting 3 hour one, and only my mom can debate about something so ridiculous everyone ends up in a fit of laughter. i just don't like being held hostage for hours, trapped in a suffocating seatbelt...... we headed further away from san francisco and closer to LA, and then it hit me all of a sudden. all i could think about was how much i was craving an enormous margarita with some great mexican food. i endured more hell when we were forced to turn off the A/C driving through the damn grapevine as my dad yapped on and on about the time my uncle jerry went on a 4 day casino binge with my auntie jeannie and an oxygen tank (don't ask).we finally hit LA and proceeded east on Hwy 10 towards the arizona border while the thermometer crept towards triple digits.... i couldn't stop thinking that my enormous margarita and mexican food was getting closer by the minute. time dragged by as we passed a random cactus or five through indio, coachella and finally blythe, until the border finally came into sight. i was giddy. the last stretch! through the 112 degree arizona desert to, downtown central phoenix... my mouth could already taste the margarita. it would be potent, it would be served in a large glass. on the rocks, no salt. i call my brother, hands shaking.... "JOEY dammit, i need good mexican. big margaritas. cheap. NOW!"our little slice of heaven just happened to be about a block or so from my brothers place, so we picked him up along the way. i could hardly contain myself as we soared into Mi Patio's parking lot, my door already open before the engine was off.i noted as we walked in it's not big or fancy, but it's cheerful, festive and warm. mom and pop type joint. you can tell by the smell, the food is going to be good.  yes, they serve $1.75 margaritas. you read that right, $1.75... my mom looked worried when she saw the gleam on my face. as you can probably guess, these cheap wonders aren't all that potent, or all that big. so i just ordered an extra shot with mine and the price was still only a few bucks more. the $2 beer specials made my dad pretty happy. the bar, already packed, seemed to be an obvious happy hour spot.next the food. no salsa is ever hot enough for my dad. it burned my mouth pretty good, but i'm not exactly a manly man so i stuck to the milder one... my brother, dad and i all ordered the carne asada picado burro while my mom had the chicken burro. now my mom is a mere 97 lbs and rarely finishes her whole plate, so it's really a testament to this place that she almost did, or even tried. (especially since they really heap the food on) the collective response from around our table was... yummm. for the price, you're coming out way ahead. trust me.halfway through dinner, as they seated 3 strapping phoenix police officers next to our table, i realized the quality of the food here wasn't just my imagination (or the effects of heavy tequila consumption). in my experience, anywhere you see a gaggle of local cops eating, is a sign of decent food. right?i left there thinking, what sweltering desert? do your worst arizona! if you keep feeding me like this, i'll take on your heat any day of the week.SO after working all day... then going to school.. first english...and then a TWO HOUR MATH class... i start craving some horchata like no other!! the entire drive home all i could think of was that luscious creamy rice milk.... mmmmm..... i get home and its 930pm already.... we don't go out much... so we kinda drove around until we found a Mexican food restaurant that was open and pulled in... there were still a few people inside so were thought SCORE!!!! we walk in and the guy at the cashier was super nice... he seated us... i of course ran to the ladies room... mmmm i give it a 3..... its didn't smell to pleasant.... and yes i do expect a bathroom to smell good... you don't wanna your customers to loose their appetites right?? by the time i got back we already had our drinks and some chips and salsa i love so much! right away i order some horchata!!! but they freeze theirs.... i never had it like that before... but it was good : ) I Got a beef Tostada... oh it was shredded beef.. and they were very generous : ) and my roommate got a Quesadilla it was the size of a med pizza!! it looked sooo yummy!!.... the service was supper speedy but our waiter seemed a little irritated... and then the bar turned off its lights... lol we were those annoying people that come in 5 minutes before closing!!!! i felt soooo bad!!! especially after hearing tid bits of what the other employees were saying to our waiter before they left.... (they were speaking Spanish... i know very little) we tried to eat as quick as possible... the cashier guy came over and finished being our Waiter... he was so nice... they closed at 10pm we were done and out by 10:08..... i don't think I've ever only spent 18 minutes in a sit down Restaurant before! lol ahhhh the things we do for our horchata cravings....Last Time i visited this place i dropped in my business card (finally a good use for them lol) and with in that next week i got a coupon in the mail for a free meal! HEYA!!! I have been itching to use it for days!! The best part is that it is only a block or so away from my school, class gets out right before 9... and it closes at 10... just enough time... math makes me crave Mexican, i cant help myself.... last night i had the shredded beef burrito with cheese and sour cream inside... and beans on the side... i was in heaven!!! Their beef is soooo goooodddd!!!! i think they are starting to recognize us.. lol Mmm I'm In love with this place!!I had been wanting to try Mi Patio for a long time.  But since it's all the way "in the avenues" as my husband says, it's taken awhile.I have to say I was almost a little disappointed upon arriving to find that it is a fairly nice restaurant, not the hole-in-wall, don't look under the table, in the window sills, and especially the kitchen, kind of place that we all know have the BEST food.  And with a nicer store front usually comes a higher price tag.  Mi Patio is no different.  Combination plates are in the $10 range.  Kind of expensive for Mexican food in my opinion.  Perhaps I'm still living in 1978.In spite of that, we were seated and introduced to their chips and salsa.  The chips, unfortunately, were cold.  Had they been hot, they would have been the thin and crispy tortilla chips I love.  But the salsa was really really really good.Because my husband and I have vowed to eat less in 2010, we shared a meal, an appetizer in fact.  Unfortunately, it was the $17 appetizer supreme that would have fed half of Mexico.  A pizza-sized platter filled with mini chimis, flautas, red chile nachos, and gyro slices (I thought that was odd, but my husband loved them).  We had wonderful service with two people making sure our drinks were kept filled.The sampler had enough variety for me to learn I will happily make the trek back to "the avenues" for Mi Patio again.Mi patio do you keep your servers on a strict diet of beatings, verbal intimidation, and benzedrine?because my server was insanely good-so good that it was suspicious... like this gentleman had his A game on, no effing joke, and i noticed he never said one word to us and never really looked us in the eye in a word: servile.we'd be sitting there and he'd be back with fresh refills of our beverages and a non stop, everlasting supply of chips and salsa the second our portions got vaguely low. once we'd barely touched our chips he'd be back with a brand new batch piping hot and crispy. probably amongst the best service i have ever encountered in my short life.Now as far as the food goes, top knotch! knotch has a silent k right? lets assume it does.the food here is deeee lish us! berry berry nice! and cheap as dirt! i swear mi patio must be running dope on the side their food and drinks are so cheap! how can they afford this!? seriously!?(sheriff joe and your cronies/goons if for some ungodly reason your're reading this the aforementioned comments were complete hyperbole and meant to be taken lightly)Mi patio you are a gem a true gem. great location, great prices, great food, superb service!What does 5 stars really mean?  To me, it is based on the individual restaurant providing great food, over-the-top-service, ambiance, cleanliness, fair prices and portions for the TYPE of restaurant that it is.  I feel that some people here are missing the boat with their reviews, as they will RAVE about the restaurant, food and service, but then only give it 3 stars!  How completely unfair!   So, in my reviews, this means that I could give a FANTASTIC McDonald's a 5 star rating if they DESERVED it, but I wouldn't give them 2 stars because of comparing them to a gourmet burger shop!  They are who they are, and if they do it well, they deserve the best praise.  With this thought in mind, ANY restaurant, no matter how simple or elaborate, has the same fair opportunity to earn 5 stars from me, if they deserved it.  If you understand what I'm saying then here goes my review....Mi Patio is a mid to low price point Mexican restaurant.  Most things on dinner menu were around $7.00 - $8.00.  The atmosphere is simple and not intended for a "night out on the town".  My ex-husband and I went there tonight.  We had two large entrees, two large size margaritas and the bill was $5.00 after our $20.00 Groupon was applied. The service was top-notch, fast and efficient.  Our waiter explained the specials in a way that enticed me to order one.  The bus-boy refilled our salsa and chips at the perfect moment without being asked.  Our food was served hot and in large portions.  In the middle of the meal, our waiter presented us with two shot glasses full of a "surprise" on-the-house-special drink that was very tasty.  When we approached the register to pay after the meal, the gentleman was very friendly about taking our Groupon and he had a genuine spirit of appreciation for us coming into the restaurant, leading me to believe he may have been the owner.    Although this was not a 5-star meal, this place certainly DESERVES 5 stars.You don't come here because you are looking for authentic Mexican food.  You don't come back here because you think to yourself "oh wow that chimichanga was the best I ever had."  You come because:1. They have random fake birds hanging all over the celing  2. They have $1.99 margaritas made from a mix with the cheapest tequila.3. They put an entire tub of sour cream on your chimichanga4. They give your kid balloon puppies upon entering5. They are family owned and always smiling (not even sure how this is possible)6. The chips are always stale and they keep them coming7. The salsa is above average and makes those stale chips taste even better8. You can dine with random cardboard hottiesSo, just keep drinking those margaritas, eating those stale chips, looking at random birds and eating your sour cream on top of a very deep friend chimichanga because nothing else matters in life.   And most likely you will find me here because this place is just plain fun.

Review Text :
I received a catered meal from here on Mon. night at a talk that I attended.  It contained a chicken burrito, a few chips and pico de gallo, and half a brownie.  While edible, the chicken burrito was nothing special--it contained mostly rice, plus some chicken and the standard black beans.  There were very few veggies, and no extras, included in the burritos.  While I understand that not everyone may want guac, sour cream, cheese, etc. in their burritos, it would be nice to offer a small portion of these as an accompaniment either in each meal, or a larger portion of them with the order for people to apply as they please.  I found the lack of extras especially ironic in light of Qdoba's recent ad campaign about extras not costing extra.Based on past experience, I believe the quality of this meal is representative of the quality of product at this Qdoba.  I visited with my labmates for lunch a little over a year ago, and recall being similarly underwhelmed by the nachos and quesadilla, both of which are two of my favorite Americanized Mexican foods.  Way back in 2007, when I tried Chipotle and Qdoba for the first time in Fort Collins, CO, I recall preferring Qdoba, because I felt that the product was similar in quality, but I appreciated the greater choice that Qdoba offered (I'm more into nachos and quesadillas than burritos, TBH).  However, based on more recent experience, I feel that the product quality at Qdoba (at least, at this location) has declined.  If they want to remain competitive with the similar business across the street, they need to kick up the product quality a notch.  As it were, they won't be receiving my business again anytime soon.

Galloping honeypots, Ocha Thai is a find![1] Their plain Jane interior may not impress, but their Thai and Chinese cooking will.Considering Ocha is in the shadow of the Stratosphere, they might seem to be a bit of a dive, especially in comparison to other spots on the Strip. On the contrary, Ocha is clean, and their service wicked fast: we were seated, had our orders taken, and got our food before we could blink. For their speed, we never were rushed.Everything was expertly prepared, from start to finish. We enjoyed their beef jerky appetizer ($8.95) - chunks of tender spiced beef brisket, sundried then deep-fried - as much as the sweet sauce that came on the side. Their chicken tom yum soup (8.95), flavored with mushrooms, lemongrass, chili and lime juice, helped ward off hunger.For entrees, try their pad thai chicken (8.95), stir-fried with bean sprouts, and a lime on the side. It's slightly sweet, with a perfect, light texture. A few plates of combination (pork, chicken, beef) fried rice (9.95/plate) rounded off our meal nicely. (Somehow we ended up with sticky rice too, but I didn't try any.)Recommended for a comfortable, affordable lunch.[1] Thanks Vy for taking me here! Getting here was an adventure, but worth the effort.Delicious authentic Thai food. Every time we come in we get what they call "the crying tiger". It's steak on a bed of lettuce that comes out with these 2 sauces. The sauces are the highlighters! This is why you cry when u eat this dish. Lol it is spicer then anything but it's also extra delicious so you just can't get enough of it! One sauce is red (my favorite) and one is green (burns your whole mouth). I honestly love spicy foods but the green sauce might just be my limit! The dish comes out with rice. I usually make like a little lettuce wrap with it. You can just dip the meat in the sauce and eat it with rice. Which ever way.. It's extra delicious. Also you can substitute the meat with chicken which is what my beau does because he's on a diet and can only eat chicken. But if you want chicken breast you have to call ahead and check if they have it because they don't always carry chicken breast. But either way it's still bomb.I've also had the chicken Pad Thai which was amazing as well. I actually ate the whole dish by myself which NEVER happens! Lol The staff are really attentive and nice. They make sure they come and talk to us and converse. Waters are always full. And one time one of the species took over my throat and I was coughing up a storm and they Gave me a free Thai tea! Which actually helped with the heat. Love this place and usually come in once a week or once every other week!

Review Text :
Reviewing Common Market on Yelp seems almost like a right of passage. Will I be the first yelper to extoll the virtues of this deli/convenience store/bar? By no means, but do I honestly value this local gem? You bet your bottom dollar! Common Market's strength is that it can be many things depending on what you need. Hungry for a meal? Go into the deli and you can choose from one of their concoctions (I recommend the reuben on rye, no mustard) or make up one of your own. Vegetarian? They have plenty of options for you as well (The mid-eastern wrap is particularly tasty). Just looking for a snack to quell the (possibly late night) munchies? They have all kinds of tasty chips, pretzels, cookies and soft drinks to satisfy.Oh, you wanted a slightly stronger drink? Well you are sure in the right place. Chilled, room temp, individual, 6-packed, in a case or on tap, Common Market has a beer selection to astound. Whether it's a PBR night or you are looking for your favorite craft brew they are prepared. I should mention they also sell wine, but with so many unique beers I tend to forget.Did you want more of a destination than a grab and go? No problem. They've got tables inside and out on their patio. They have weekly live music performances. Or you could just pick up a copy of the paper and do the crossword.Worried about parking? They have spaces in the front, a lot in the back, there is street parking and a large lot around the corner. Oh, and they have bike racks out back.Do be advised that they have a $5 credit/debit minimum, so have cash if you are just grabbing a snack or drink.Wow! Coolest beer shop I've been to in a long time! This place is amazing. They've got it all! The beer selection here is quite impressive. They specialize in hard to find beers, with a section for sour beers, IPAs, and seasonals. They have a small bar, where you can get a beer on tap, and drink it there, or out on their nice patio. They also sell wine! They've got a wine expert on site to help you with your selections. The staff is also quite knowledgeable about their beers as well. Since I was an out-of-towner, they were able to steer me to the best local beers, made just down the street. The store also sells weird knickknacks and strange toys, like pigeon masks, or red fuzzy fezes.  The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant. They made the visit quite enjoyable. In the back, they have a deli with a wide variety of sandwiches, and a vending machine that sells musical accessories, like drum sticks and guitar strings. The place isn't exactly clean, but I get the feeling that they're going for a dive vibe, which is certainly working for this place. The patio is nice and large, with outdoor heaters and plenty of seating. They allow you to bring your beer purchased inside out onto the patio and drink it right there. This is something I'm not accustomed to, but I really enjoyed the experience! If you're looking for something good to drink, this is your place.

Stopped here as part of my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I live in the neighborhood, so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a try.  I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!I wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza "well done" and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami, Mortadella, Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Italian Dressing, $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly "fell" out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty, but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup, but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=Iqzb-H48B0AgB0vX-tKhDgNext I went for the Pizza.....I took one bite and thought it might have been a bust....but it grew on me.  The Crust is chewy and the Tomato Sauce has an interesting flavor.....all I can say is that I wanted more and that's always a good thing....for now, I'll give it 3 Stars.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=xHoP8sxg9hyWexhiY6x52AThe employees are really friendly too and I think it's family owned, which I love.  Overall, the joint gets 3 Stars and the Pizza will definitely get a 2nd try from me.Return Factor - 80%

Thank God we live in America. I can't imagine that this could be the standard in another country.I have been to next-door Los Compadres hundreds of times, but never ventured into Diamonds. It's a weird Chinese looking building, but as many times as I've driven by, I'd never gone in. Until recently.My brother and I resolved to finally check it out. We parked in back and made our way toward the front door. There was water streaming across the driveway into the gutter, and white bits of something were strewn throughout. I didn't think much of it at the time.When we opened the door, we were instantly greeted with the sight, sound and smell of 5 huge aquariums, all holding seafood that presumably was going to be eaten soon. I got the distinct impression that the floor hadn't been swept in three or four months.After we made our order and sat waiting for our take out, I noticed a large brown spot on the front of the counter. Hmmm... And then it moved. Oh my god. This is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life. It must have been five inches long. I was mortified such that I could not find my voice. And then a second one appeared, and then a third. OMG. I finally got the manager's attention and pointed to it. She quickly moved to the front of the counter, and cupping her hand, caught it, and then scurried back to the kitchen with it.I was going to be sick. I ran toward the bathroom, and found myself splashing through a big puddle all the way to the toilet. UGH. The toilet was already full from someone before me. So I flushed. And then came the most wrong sound you've ever heard come from a water pipe as and what was in the toilet started rising to the top. I fled and grabbed my brother by the arm.As I squished my way back along the walkway toward the driveway, I realized what was streaming across the parking lot and into the gutter. It was raw sewage littered with bits of wet toilet paper.Someone needs to shut this place down.$35 buy you black beans clams, steam fish topped with shredded ginger, ginger & onion lobster, and no charge on rice!  You might find this type of deal in New York, Cali or Chicago, rarely in Arizona.     I felt I grew up with this restaurant.   My family has been coming here for years.  It has been so many years that I have back.   I was really impressed with the consistency of the dishes.  Everything still tasted delicious.  If you want authentic Chinese food, do not order from the regular menu; ask for the Chinese one with English translation.  You will not be disappointed! The clay pot beef tendon/stew (the gravy goes well with other dishes if you don't like the meat) and pea seedling/Dou Miao with garlic sauce are a must try.*** Note*** Go here knowing that you'll get good and affordable food, but find the service and ambiance lacking.

Great location to soak up some drink before you go home to pass out. The staff can be nice or rude depending on you. (I prefer rude) The food is good, nothing pretentious or assuming. You get what they give you and you eat it. I don't think I would bring Mom for Sunday Breakfast but for a quick bite, it hits the spot. Better then Denny's unless you want your Superbird or French Toast. The waitress was even nice enough to call a cab for us.If restaurants were fairy tales, Waffle House is "Prince and the Pauper". Its an exercise in humility. It allows you to see how the rest of the world eats while you're eating 25 dollar salads."Oh what a wonderfully horrid place! Now, if we could only find the hostess..."Can't afford a hostess. Sorry. Just find a table. Try to find one that's clean. "Very well. Oh, I do think I would enjoy some sparkling water and cranberry juice-"There's soda and there's coffee. Or they have two flavors of water; dirty tap and dirty tap with ice. "Oh, um, very well. There doesn't seem to be enough menus for everyone at our party."Share."Oh...um, fair enough then. I will have the all-star special, with cheese on my eggs and, how do you say it, my hash browns 'smothered' and 'covered'? Oh that sounds so delightfully filthy."Whatever turns you on, man."Oh dear me, they're cooking it right in front of us...that man's not wearing any plastic gloves! He's man-handling my food with his bare hands! This is outrageo--oh wait...is this how you lowly folk eat? Well then, don't mind me! GET YOUR HANDS ALL OVER MY FOOD, GOOD MAN! IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE SOME EXTRA HAIR IN MY BACON! HAHAHA!"..."No, seriously, I didn't want any hair in my bacon"Okay, well let me just pluck it out off your plate. All better then."Did you just put YOUR hands on my food too!? The gall! The bravado! I love it!"How's your food?"My bacon's crunchy, I can feel the cheese you've smothered all over my eggs clogging my arteries, these hash browns are a texture and consistency I've never seen occur in nature anywhere, and another cup of this coffee and I'll be able to do wind sprints back to my house. I absolutely love it! I'm never going back to my old life of roasted pheasant and caviar ever again. Do you hear me world, EVAR!"It's something like that. For serious.

Went to New Tokyo Food Market today for some Japanese staples...Miso soup, nori (dried seaweed), Osenbei (flavored rice crackers), Furikake (dried seasoning mix) and Panko bread crumbs for Tempura recipes and they carry many other hard to find Japanese products. Prices are very reasonable and most products are authentic and not Americanized versions. Owner came over and helped us with our selections without being asked! Very helpful and nice!  Highly recommend this market located on S/E corner of 35th Ave. and Northern. Parking area is limited however! Banzai!!!!

Restaurant name  Pho Saigon 8

Review Text :
When you're in Vegas and someone has a car, the obvious choice is to eat off-strip. Pho was the consensus. And so I suggested Pho Kim Long, the only pho place I knew in the area. That was quickly shot down. Dang should've known better than to suggest a pho place to Vietnamese people. LOL! Pho Saigon 8 was 3-4 miles from the strip; 15-20 minute ride with traffic. The restaurant was spacious; clean and bright with modern décor. The staff was hilarious and super accommodating! My friends asked for things I've never heard of for their pho and the servers immediately brought out the requests and in large quantities; some sort of herb, the fat from the broth and onions soaked in oil. My order of charbroiled chicken over rice vermicelli was so refreshing! Loads of noodles and chicken! Yum! Awesome lunch!Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.Been there once... and that's okay for me.You are greeted when you walk in and sat at a table. They will then take your order. You will get your order within 5-10 minutes. Awesome!!!BUT don't expect to see them again for the remainder of your meal. This is how most Vietnamese restaurants operate but this location does it much more apparently. There is a sign in front that says "please pay here." This saves the restaurant staff the closing step of service, which is to bring out your bill. I understand why they do this, however it makes paying the bill and leaving a tip a less personable experience. The restaurant is usually always busy which makes eating here somewhat of an experience but other than that...consider this a fast casual spot.

I came to Murray Avenue Grill for my birthday brunch a few months ago, and I was impressed.  My friend and I had been hoping to go to Pamela's, but when the wait was two hours, we decided to try here out.  There was no wait on a Sunday morning around 10:30.  I've yet to try Pamela's, but I don't think I'll ever make it there since this is right across the street!How do you start brunch on your birthday?  With a birthday mimosa, of course!  The mimosa was delicious and not terribly priced.  From there I moved to a massive breakfast burrito, covered in tomatoes.  I couldn't quite finish the whole thing, but I took it to go and ate it later.  I definitely would order it again.  My friend ordered steak and eggs, and the steaks were a really nice size for the price.The wait staff was friendly, and I cannot wait to come back here to try out the lunch and dinner menus!

My favorite thing about this place: it's walking distance from my house and I can wear sweatpants there with no judgement. Or maybe they are judging me. Oh well.My buddy Vijay and I swung by for dinner last Tuesday. I was super bummed when I saw that the special the night before was meatloaf. However, it was my lucky day. They still had meatloaf left! Hip, hip... hooray! No mashed potatoes, though. Sigh, guess I have no choice but to eat delicious mac n cheese. When in Rome, you have to get the chili. We couldn't decide which one to get. Our server suggested mixing two together. Brilliant. We went with Texas and Southern. Texas is on the spicy side. I liked the combo of the two. Vijay also got a burger. Holy. This thing was huge. I was shocked when he was able to eat the whole thing. I have to get up here on a Thursday. Why? The special is chicken and dumplings. Sounds like the perfect meal on a chilly night. Not to be confused with chili....

Not so sober review #339Dear Diary,I started drinking today in the most civilized way, bubbly with a girlfriend out of fancy, thrift store, vintage, bird bath champange glasses, oh la la la. Then went to a holiday bubbly tasting, snacks at Good Food on Montford, then all hell breaks loose.We are walking by Jeff's Bucket Shop, my friend says, "what's Jeff's Bucket Shop?" Well. I don't know, I could tell you exactly where it is, but have I been there? No. So, I was like, let's go find out.You walk down a narrow hallway with a HUGE neon lit arrow pointing to the door, OMG, you had me at HELLO!  We walk into a teeny tiny bar, with the bartender and a few patrons. Everyone is low key, but friendly. The bartender is super, super nice.  Oh Jeez, it's loaded with boys and there are some cute ones. Oh my. Yummy, little Debbie snack cakes and drink specials, nice barkeep and kaorake at 10p.  Sweet Jesus, give me the mike. but no, not even loaded with alcohol, I'm still too shy.I might say, now don't quote me tomorrow, but right now, I love you Jeff.This is a hole in the ground kinda place... you heard me, I said ground not wall, considering you literally walk down a narrow stairwell to get to the little door in order to discover this little establishment.  By the way, I do mean LITTLE, I've seen someone's bathroom bigger than this joint.Let's be real peeps... this place is put in the "Dive Bar" category for a reason.  Besides, the place is called "Jeff's Bucket Shop,"  I seriously for the longest time don't even know of its existance... or what the heck Jeff is selling by the bucket, or if Jeff is trying to sell buckets, or who the heck is Jeff?!  So yes, there maybe a little weird smell (frankly I don't even pay attention to it, and I have a super good nose, but I do have high tolerance for "weird smell" courtesy of my heritage lol).  My personal suggestion is stop asking what the heck that smell is (because you probably don't want to know) and just keep drinking.I have been here mostly on Fridays and they have karaoke.  I think they have karaoke on other nights too.  Not sure if they always have the same host, and if he is the regular, let me warn you, he doesn't play... he will gong you off that stage like you're on Apollo if you are seriously tone-deaf.  This place gets packed.  So if you have issues with being too crowded, well... not sure if you want to sardine your way into here on a weekend night.  And again, if you are the high-er maintanence type, you may want to stick with your "safer" choices and go next door or across the street or uptown.  But honestly, it's always a good crowd, nice people having fun together, beer isn't too expensive, and I always have a blast here.

The curious case of the disappearing review. I'm sure I've reviewed Fajita's before, but it seems to have vanished.Fajita's has some spectacular lunch specials. I give them 5 full stars for their lunch, not so much for dinner (much more pricey), which some how I've determined equals out to 4 stars.So, go there for lunch, munch on some tasty fajitas on the cheap. Being a vegetarian, I thoroughly enjoy the veggie fajitas for a mere $5. They make their own in house tortillas, which are unique and very good. They also include their tasty chips & salsa for every customer.Awesome lunch spot.Ive driven past this place on the freeway about a million times and has always vowed that one day, i will try this place! and out of complete randomness.... it became my Saturday night dinner :) As we park the car, we could already tell this place was packed! we walked in and there were parties waiting to be seated ... lucky for us... we were seated right away... I'm sure we deemed ugly hungry stares for it to... hey its not our fault their are only two of us.... right after we were seated our drink orders were taken by a very welcoming young gentleman. :) and out chips and salsa were brought out promptly too! The Salsa was amazing... and the chips were fresh ... and hot!! that could have been my meal i was so content.... this place has great lighting.... not to bright or too dull... just how i like it. in the middle of the place there was a huge area where they cooked all the food... or at least some of it... it looked like fun.... we shared the beef Fajitas... they were amazing!! grilled on top of bell peppers and onions... red and white... mm served with rice, beans w/cheese, guacamole and a tray of salsa, sour cream and cheese... it was SO good and they brought out your tortillas in a little bowl with a cover to keep them warm.. but they tasted more like pita bread... either way everything was hot and fresh and out in a very timely fashion.. especially since this place was packed... i like this place alot... i would love to come back again and maybe sit near the chefs area :)I was thrilled to be able to come to Fajitas for my friend's birthday lunch. This restaurant has been around for what seems like eons and a very fitting venue to celebrate the big 4-0! In fact, this place was a regular haunt of mine for years and I even had my 17th birthday party here (with my friend Kari the now 40 year old!).We had a party of 16-Kari's family, her parents, siblings and their families. We were seated at a long table and the first thing I noticed is that the decor is exactly the same as it was since we were in high school. The menu changed a little bit, but the salsa and chips were the same too. We had a nice waitress, the iced tea was great and we ordered cheese crisps to start and as a table ordered beef, chicken and shrimp fajitas along with a couple of sides of guacamole.The cheese crisps arrived first and were incredible. Ivy, if you are reading, this is a must have cheese crisp!Better than both Macayo's or Garcia's hands down. Light, crisp and fabulous. In fact I liked the cheese crisps better than the fajitas! The fajitas arrived, the shrimp had good flavor but were small and shriveled looking and obviously overcooked. The steak wasn't as good as I remember it and realized we didn't order the more expensive meat (cadillac) so that could be why. The chicken was perfectly cooked and really good. The tortillas are great-these have been around since before Chevy's hit the Phoenix area and I will admit the guacamole was delicious and quite the surprise. I was thrilled at how good the meal was and even more thrilled to be celebrating with my friend at a place that has so much history within our friendship.For those of you who are Fajita's newbies-here is a warning. This is the type of restaurant that the food smell sticks to you inside and out. I knew we were coming here so I had planned on what to wear-even down to the bra I traveled in and knew I would be doing laundry before I packed to come home the next day. Yep, long running joke about Fajita burps, farts, and clothing and they are all true so beware! Years ago, they didn't have a product like Febreeze. Now that they do, makes eating here a lot easier!Stumbled upon Fajitas while driving around......lost in Phoenix.Frikkin' GPS! Left turn here! Right turn now!!! We damn near hit a lightpole before we got our asses good and lost! Grrr!!! Anyway, somehow through this mess we located Fajitias and yazz, yazz!!!Ya' can't go wrong with amazing deals! The place is actually quite huge and the margaritas (offered at $3/each) didn't disappoint. We'd actually ordered the Mexican pizza as an appetizer thinking we'd be able to make it to an actual entreé (#fajitas)....But this thing arrived and was so huge that it literally became a meal. The savings from not ordering an actual entreé allowed us to order extra booze. We departed full of food and booze for less than $20. Unbeatable!!!

I had a coupon so stopped by for lunch. It was still to expensive. I had a Turkey Club  and a double slice of Cheese Pizza. With coupon it was still almost $11 and my pizza was burnt to hell. I couldn't even eat the pizza because all of the burnt black spots just didn't look right. The turkey sub was just okay. I can get a bigger sub from Subway that tastes better. With the right coupon I do like certain things here but they aren't consistent as far as the taste and quality of the food. There is a drive thru or you can eat inside and get free bread sticks.

Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. The brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. So here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. It just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. Not sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch.Disclaimer: my only experiences at Hambone's are for drinks only and I have not had food other than the buffalo dip.Now that PHI is gone, Hambone's is one of the bars that can fill the gap in my soul that can only be filled by the greatest of dives. I just wish it would have been closer to Oakland when I was in school. I have never had a negative experience here with service and the regulars are very friendly. If you are around on a Thursday night, you must stop in for comedy open-mic night. There are plenty of other events that happen (I think Wednesdays are board game night, that was a blast) and seating is usually adequate except during Thursday night in my experience. Drinks are cheap and they always have something fun - who would have thought about serving a Hug (the little plastic barrels filled with sugary drink) and a shot? Well a genius at Hambone's did.Put it on the list if you're having a bar crawl through Lawrenceville, or just start here and stay all night. You won't be disappointed.

"The perfect lover is one who turns into a pizza at 4:00 a.m."  - Charles PierceOne fateful night after a long grueling ten-hour shift, the ladies who work next door decided that we were going to grab some pizza and wings and complain relentlessly about working in customer service.  Pizza, wings, and a bitch-fest?  I'm down!Being that I'm not from the Avondale area, I never would have came across this place if it wasn't for my ladies.  We have invaded Brother's time-and-time again for years and we always get the same large pizza and wings special they have.  Wings are always lip-smacking delicious and the pizza is gigantic and oozing with cheese and grease.  The crust isn't strong enough to hold their generous amounts of toppings and is pretty flavorless by itself but we can always toss away the crust, right?  It's the kind of comfort food you need after a day of dealing with ignorant and difficult people.  One bite from this place I don't like:  the canoli.  Then again, I'm not crazy for canolis so what do I know?Brother's isn't a glamorous establishment by any means.  It's brightly lit, there are multiple televisions with sports on, the tables and booths are strong and sturdy, and there's a semi-sporty theme going on.  It's definitely not a romantic date spot but hey, you can grab a beer and catch a game while eating some cheap eats!

About 15 years ago I would stop in here to grab breakfast before heading to work a couple times a week. I have noticed for sometime now that Dima's Tacos is still in business, so I made a point to come in for breakfast to see if it was like I had remembered. Inside is small with only maybe 4 or 5 tables. The woman who took my order was nice and gave me time to look over the menu. She also told me that they were not the original owners of Dima's and that it has changed hands over the years. Her and her husband recently started a lease, so anybody familiar with Dima's Tacos before might notice a difference in the menu and prices. Since it had been so long since my last visit, I just hoped for good food. The prices are fair depending on what you order. Some menu items are made fresh and other stuff isn't. My total was around $11.Agua Fresca - This wasn't made fresh and came from a fountain machine. It also tasted watered down. Cheese Quesadilla - Good size and really the only thing I enjoyed. It's kind of hard to mess up a cheese quesadilla.Bacon Breakfast Burrito - I knew it was not going to be like I remembered Dima's being all those years ago, but wow it really wasn't the same! The burritos used to be really big (double wrapped) and now they are long and skinny. I don'y mind since they use really big tortillas and it still ends up being a decent size. The scrambled eggs were not mixed all the way before being made, so I ended up with a white and yellow scramble, not good. There was only 2 or 3 small pieces of potato in the center and that's it. The burrito could have definitely used more potato. I also paid for extra cheese to be added and there was none at all. The bacon tasted good, but was hard at times.

I want an Owlzilla and I want one now *stomps feet*Fat bastard wouldn't sell me one and they are the only good thing about this place.  (Except for wings, read below)The casino is the size of a peehole.  The girls do not have hot hootz or hot asses.  Fuhglee bitches in tight orange shorts, shiny hosiery (that's pantyhose for hos), ohhh, you all know the uniform.Service is slow.  The bartender chick was ugly and rude and poured weak drinks, and I was PAYING for these drinks.  I understand to order beer if I'm gambling, but my pretty lil ass was sitting at the bar and I expect some vodka with my soda, thank you very much.Why two stars????  Because after 11pm, they serve 10 chicken wings for $2.50 and I'm a girl who likes a bargain.  The 9-1-1 wings were pretty spicy.  Almost a lil too spicy, but darn tasty.Never again Not So Hot Hootz-ers, unless I'm nearby and craving wings.So, I got a group of friends together to go to Vegas with me to ring in my 30th year of life. I had to keep in mind that some people are on a budget with kids, mortgages, etc. Bingo! Hooter's came up on my search. I'm not one of those women that are scared of Hooter's girls, so I didn't hesitate booking our stay there.When we arrived, I noticed the place was FULL of men. Perfect place for a single girl to stay! We were greeted by a friendly front desk staff who upgraded our rooms to "Ocean View" rooms due to my sheer awesomeness....ok I don't know why they upgraded us, but it was cool.My room was clean and comfy with a nice view. My bed was comfortable, nothing cushy or posh, but comfortable. The only things I would change would be to replace the carpet because it's old, brighten up the hallways a bit, and update the elevators. Other than that it's a cool little hotel. If I'm ever breezing in and out of Vegas again, I'll probably stay there to save some dough. It's nothing fancy, but it's a clean, budget friendly place to stay.Another yelper said they were giving out 10 Free Wings to new Rewards card members so I decided to take full advantage.I signed up for the Rewards card & got a funbook. It gave me $100 free slot play-i lost, 10 free wings, and 2 for 1 beer. So I went to Hooters had some wings and a steak sandwich. The food was decent-good meaty hot wings, i had them 3 mile island style.the atmosphere was incredible, and the price was just right. 20 wings, steak sandwich,4 beers less than $20There is a little bit of a wait since this place is packed but they have lots of TV's and the pool has a bar and firepits.Good food,limited menu but good prices so close to the strip.Hooters girls arent what they used to be, all the girls here look under 21 and they aren't so scntily clad as most cocktail waitresses in other casinos.The steak sandwich wasnt charbroiled but it was still fairly good, the wings were big and juicy wit ha little crunch, i liked them.The pool & the porch is the best seat in the house. Theres lots of Tv's everywhere to make sure you can catch the game from any seat in the house.I was in Vegas recently on business at a trade show. Saw some buddies that I used to interface and partner with, and so we decided to go out and eat and catch up. Let's see, you are in Las Vegas, on business, and of all the choices, where would you want to go? Since their company is very cheap, they have a very small expense allowance. And since their company definitely has a macho-like personality, sort of a frat brothers, locker room personna, they chose Hooters!I said "Are you kidding me?" I suggested going to Chinatown and getting some good, inexpensive food, like Thai, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and I had a car to take them all out there. But since it was 3 of them versus just me, it was Hooters.Hooters Hotel and Casino is exactly like their restaurants. Girls in white Tees and little orange gym shorts. You would think that here in Vegas, this would be their flagship location and they would upscale it in decor, amenities, and staffing. Nope. Even though it is a hotel and Casino, it has the same look and feel of their restaurants. What do they call themselves? Tacky? They got that right.Plus, Hooters has awful food. Deep fried, tasteless, unimaginative. It's food you might find in Talledega at the NASCAR races in the picnic coolers of the baseball cap wearing HVAC and Cable repair men. Only warmed up a bit. In Vegas, with all the beautiful women working here in the various service venues of shows, casinos, gentelmen's clubs, etc., Hooters has got to be the bottom of the barrel. The "talent" here is just above 7 Eleven, just wearing less. That makes the food that much more indigestible.Apparently, the Hooters Hotel has 24-hour $3 blackjack tables. I mean, there are banners posted against the building outside, there are signs above the slot machines...The Hooters Hotel is supposed to have 24-hour $3 blackjack tables.My friend and I walked into the Hooters Hotel.We looked for these $3 blackjack tables.We circled the casino three times.THERE WERE NO $3 BLACKJACK TABLES.One star for false promotions. (I was looking forward to cheap gambling too!)Some of my friends laughed and others scoffed at the fact that I had booked accommodations at the Hooters Casino Hotel for my Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon weekend in Las Vegas.It wasn't as bad as everybody told me it would be, and considering I booked many months in advance and found Expedia rates ranging from $45 to $55 a night for a room in the Tower building I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  For the race the "off the Strip" location was perfect as it was a comfortable fifteen minute walk to the start / finish area on race day.My room was okay since I only spent time there to sleep and to yelp.  With the exception of parts of the carpet the room was fairly clean too.  I wore white socks in the room and each night my white socks turned either light gray or charcoal colored depending on how much walking I did in the room.Here were some of the cool things about my room:*The queen size bed was firm and comfortable (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=iHWbOO5Jzfh31dVthmiB6Q).*Standard sized television (no flat screen) had crisp cable broadcasting.*Comfortable desk had a brand new issue of the latest Hooters magazine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=96qyqd-PoYisLKTjPUswuA).*There is a digital room safe just in case you decide to go out for a 13 or 26 mile run (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=BZMBwl3J5Y6vylsT0c-hBA).*Clean bathroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=dPRiakqkf2jm4_1Tyw-Iww).*Basic amenities (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=yqsvK9WYxf_OtSIjZUBXIA).*Free bottled water (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=S4pY5Ebf2pSWPyP59WTvmQ).  Runners love water!!*Two fake palms in the room look great without the flying insects (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=YBp_3-oEiKi-ayVqcVDe_w).*Amusing privacy door signs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=toTBsd8WeZhsSMAEALOiOQ).Of course there's always bad things that makes it a 3 star review:*The comforter was lumpy.*No free internet.  No problem as I brought a wireless card this time.*The deadbolt kept slamming into the door jamb.  I had to whip out my Leatherman and do a repair job for them.  The deadbolt works perfectly now.  You're welcome!!*Noisy pipes and the water pressure in the water closet was horrible.*Toilet tissue holder was too short and the spool would come loose and fall on the floor every time the tissue was in use.*Thin walls.  I heard every foul-mouthed conversation my neighbors had, but I heard every intimate one too!*Horrible, lazy housekeeping staff!  I did a better job cleaning up after myself!*Incompetent and slow check-in process.  The lady kept mispronouncing my last name.  How do you fuck up my last name?  It's three letters and the second and third letters are the same vowel.  Dummy!I didn't take advantage of the slot playing amenity that came with the room.  The casino downstairs is very small.  Like I said, if I could find these rates again I would return.  If not, don't bother!"You get what you pay for"If only that were the truth.Let's see....  We got there and:1) The elevator from the parking structure is out - so we hoof it from the 4th floor all the way to reception with our bags in tow.  2)We got booked into a smoking room when we specifically asked for a non-smoking room3)We got transferred to a non-smoking room (after a few hours) with a view of the Airport.... well, there would have been a view if the windows weren't so damned grimy4)Uncomfortable Bed5)Tube TV that kept cutting out every few minutes, which wouldn't have been bad on its own, but the batteries on the remote were dead.. HAH!Okay, at 25 bucks a night, I might have agreed that we got what we paid for and it might have been a So-so 2.5 to three stars.  MAYBE.But when you tack on an additional UNDISCLOSED $15/day "Resort Fee"  (What resort? it was 40 freakin Degrees out!), No Wi-Fi AND $15/day wired internet fee??  ....Umm... Yeah ... 1.5 stars and I'm not even going to round it up to two.PROTIP: Hooters appears to be where failed Import model wannabes with bad boob jobs go to die. - Enjoy.I'm pretty bias when it comes to eating at this popular chain.  Seems it doesn't take much to make me happy inside a Hooters restaurant.  Since I was staying in the hotel you would kind of figure that at least one of my meals would be at the Hooters restaurant.  I had lunch at this Hooters on the day of my departure.Seated immediately near the front entrance I was in a perfect spot to view some very nice eye candy.  Most of the ladies smile as they walk by here.  It made me happy too!  My waitress was a nice German girl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=RAW5jfLOBzpLhYENbeiHbw).  She was very friendly, and I loved her accent, but she was an excellent waitress also.  Despite how busy this place is during a weekday lunch rush she came by three or four times to make sure everything was okay and I had enough food and drink.I had a single order of ten wings, medium spicy and unbreaded (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=DYflGlGsO2mPs7T35u7a9g).  I also had an order of seasoned curley fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=UFYn0PR07eWLb0UUEaigEA).  The wings were excellent, but the fries could have had a bit more zest.  No complaints from me though.  I love all Hooters restaurants!I've stayed in some of the worst roach infested seaside motels in California, and this was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in. It's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. The drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. They sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. It wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... Every shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.Sadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.In the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. I paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. If you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.Fuck this place.Vegas visitor beware.Let me start with the good and the only reason/s this hotel was worth a crap.1. it was free and comped to us by a friend 2. their 9$ prime rib was waaaay better than the Planet Hollywood 40$ filet mignon I had.Ok, now onto every other factor of this place. Hope your ready...1. hotel itself = disgusting, smells like urine and raid EVERYWHERE. Its so bad that I notified the hotel security and he laughed and said "really!? wow, i guess ive been here so long I cant even smell it."2. hotel security = bunch of idiots. we got locked out of our room, they would not let us back in even tho our IDs and personal effects that we could claim were inside. We had to go thru a stupid ordeal just to get allowed back in WTF!?3. Elevators = all of them broke and I found out that they dont really ever get fixed. Not only that, their is tagging and graffiti all over the place. Where the hell is your pride of ownership? Not to mention everytime we went inside them we had to hold our breath because if it wasnt the urine smell it was the overwhelming smell of raid roach spray!4. Dealers = i forgot her name but she was a total %&^%$ to us and made it completely un-fun to play they so we went and dropped a few hundred at PH Westgate instead, where we actually felt welcome5. Carpets = stains all thru-out. Disgusting!6. Room Service = incompetent. They delivered our food and then made us feel super bad because we didnt have EXACT change because guess what... they dont carry change on them when they deliver your food. Are you serious? She looked at me and went "you dont have change? ahhhhhhhh, i guess i can go back down and get your change if you really want me to" ... Are you ^%&^#ing joking me!? Of course I want you too idiot. I gave you an 18% gratuity to simply bring food to my door. You didnt cook it, you walked it up and dropped it off. So what? I should give you an extra 11 dollars cause you didnt bring change... BEAT IT!Over all, I brought a celebrity here and this place is a fricking joke. I would think even with someone of class we would be treated better. Its miserable and the owners should be ashamed of their establishment. I was embarrassed for them. I have been all over the world and never felt more unwelcome and inconvenienced.Owners - with all respect, i think its important you start communicating with your clients to hear and feel their disappointment. Feel free to contact me  danny@npmusic.comWow, I seriously cannot figure out what everyone is complaining about. I honestly think people need to take into consideration that at Hooters you get what you pay for. If you are paying $20 for a hotel room in Vegas do not expect to get a 5 STAR, luxury "Wynn" experience. What we got for our $20 per night was the following:1 clean, very basic hotel room.20 free wings at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel.2 free frozen drinks at the pool bar, plus one additional drink because it was "ladies week"2 free "American" breakfasts at The Mad Onion.In addition to all the freebies, we received excellent customer service from everyone we interacted with at Hooters. All the hotel bars have $1.50 Bud/Bud Light if you are looking for cheap beer. Room Service will deliver Hooters wings to your room. The pool is open 24/7. There is a pretty decent fitness room/gym. If you are so inclined, there is a tattoo parlor in the hotel. The location is good...It is a very short walk to the Las Vegas Strip from the hotel.Yes, the service at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel is slow.Yes, the parking garage and elevators are a little dingy.No, it did not smell like poo, urine, sewage, raid, or anything else that people have complained about. Two items of note:There is an $8 resort fee per day.There were many people on our floor who sat outside of their rooms, in the hallway, and smoked. So FYI, your room may be non-smoking but the hallway is not. If you are just looking for a cheap, clean, no-frills place to crash, Hooters will serve the purpose. If you are looking for anything more than that, this is not the place for you. Move along...nothing to see here.We were staying across the street at the MGM Grand, and every time I looked out the window by the elevator I saw the owl on the Hooters Casino sign staring at me.  It was hypnotic, and there is a strong possibility that the sign may have even winked at me (or maybe that I just needed to get some more sleep).  So I got a couple of people to walk with me across the street on an adventure to the Hooters Casino. From the outside, it looks like an oversize Hooters.  On the inside, the casino is tiny and smaller than anything I have seen on the strip.  We were able to walk through the entire casino in less than a couple of minutes.  There wasn't very many people in the casino, and there seemed to be more employees than patrons on a Saturday night.  All of the dealers were Hooters girls, deck out in their white and orange gear.  The theme of Hooters was evident and well maintained throughout.When we got to the back of the Casino, I went into the store to check out what they had.  They had some cute Hooters branded cloths, and I found a jersey top that I liked to buy for my wife.  After that, we took a look out the back door of the casino to see the pool.  It was pretty sad.  There were just a bunch of dudes hanging out, and not a Hooter in sight.  The pool looked like a giant sized Motel 6 pool, and did not look like a fun place to hang out at all.  So we headed back inside towards the front of the Casino.  We passed two restaurants on the way.  One of them being a Hooters, of course.  When we got to the front there was another store that I did not notice when we first walked in.  This store had lots more cloths and Hooters paraphernalia, so I went in to check it out and ended up buying more stuff.  They had a special in the store that if you buy $35 of merchandise you get a free gift.  The clerk at the registered informed me that for a $1.50 I could buy a sacky bag.  I thought I was a $1.50 off of hitting the $35 mark and so I agreed to get the bag.  It turned out that the bag was another promotion, and that my free gift was actually a Hooters girl calendar...from 2010  :IAfter buying all of the cute Hooters gear for my wife to wear, we went on our way.  Now that she has all of these cloths I don't have to bother going to Hooters anymore to check out the girls in the itsy-bitsy outfits.  I look forward to Val making me a Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich in one of her new Hooters outfits, and I'm pretty sure I won't go to this casino again.  There really wasn't anything special to see or do here.The following review is specifically for the "Bungalow room type" These rooms are in the attached two story building out by the swimming pool. We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street. Did not have a secure feeling as it felt like anyone could walk up from the street and have direct access to the sliding glass door. The rooms are all nonsmoking in the Bungalows so the sliding glass door was good for lover boy to go in and out for a smoke. That was the only good thing! Thank goodness I had my lover Sean with me for protection, otherwise I would have been sleeping with one eye open. We only stayed here one night as we attended an industry VIP open bar event and showing for "Purple Reign" who performs at Hooter's. We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night. This room sucked balls, and not the good kind. The bathroom tub was moldy and the water did not drain, seriously I took a shower standing in half a tub of water! The walls and floors had major mold as well. The room was very small, and had one outlet for electricity which was occupied by the lamp and TV. We had to reach behind and unplug the TV just to charge our phone, ridiculous. The towels are cheap, stained and shredding. Wow the quality is so bad it makes paper towels a better option to dry off with. The ice machine was broke, took housekeeping 45 minutes to bring us a bucket of ice. Yes! You get what you pay for in Vegas when it comes to hotel accommodations! It was $27 for the night (weekday) we stayed on a Tuesday. Crappy rooms, moldy bathrooms and no outlets for charging your cell will leave you with a stinky taste in your mouth by staying in these rooms! Hooter's is a huge let down, it is obvious they have given up and are not going to put any money into keeping this property updated. What a shame! I normally complain when something is this bad, luckily for the front desk we had partied so much and just wanted to jump in bed and get busy. I later sent an email to Hooter's "Customer Service" with the complaint details of our stay, did I get a response? Of course not...lol I knew that was a waste of time. Don't do it! Please Please I beg of you!Despite the 2.5 stars given on Yelp, we decided $42/night was a delightfully tacky, yet unrefined situation we were willing to dive head first into. Vegas served as the launch pad for our 5 day Southwest "tour," so when booking our Vegas hotel the day-of we weren't exactly worried about splurging for a Bellagio experience.  When we scrolled across Hooters shocking $42 ticket price, giggled for a moment and then said "what the hell."  We were feeling so fancy, we splurged for the tower room for an extra five bucks.The saying "wine on a beer budget" comes to mind when I decided upon my star rating for this hotel.  For $42, my top concern was two things: decent location and clean rooms. And ya know what? Hooters did a pretty darn good job in both categories. The hotel is located right at the end of the strip across from MGM, New York New York and Excalibur. The room isn't anything fancy - ha, in fact it has a few (definitely tacky) touches of Hooters with orange lampshades, knotty pine wood trim and Hooters artwork (not tatas; however, this would be more entertaining, but a sketch of a Hooters restaurant). The location is very easy to find off highway 15/Tropicana Avenue. Parking is free and plentiful.  There are times when I look for a hotel that is bubbling over with character and others when the hotel is serving one purpose: safe/clean place to rest my head. Vegas may not be my cup of tea, but Hooters will most likely serve as my launch pad the next time I'm here. Hard to beat $42 for the tackiest hotel in town.My girlfriends and I were on the hunt for a good deal in Vegas, and stumbled upon Hooters Hotel & Casino. We couldn't believe how cheap the rooms were - as long as $25 on weeknights and maybe $60 on weekends. SO much less than what you'd find on the strip. I booked 2 rooms without any problems and couldn't get over how cheap 2 rooms for 3 nights was!With that being said, we were fully prepared for a cheap hotel experience and weren't expecting anything like Caesars or The Venetian. We were pleasantly surprised at how "nice" the place was. If you need a comparison, think of a Days Inn or Comfort Inn. The main lobby has all the gambling and blackjack tables as low as $3. There are several restaurants and apparently the pool rocks, but unfortunatley it was cold so that feature wasn't open. The rooms weren't nearly as bad as some reviewers had written. Seriously, if you want a 4+ start experience, go to a 4 star hotel!The hotel is located just a block off the strip behind MGM. We ended up having to take a cab anytime we were too lazy (heels) or cold to walk the strip, but overall we still saved tons of money. It would have been nice to stay on the strip but hey, you get what you pay for.The staff is pretty nice but I will tell you, bar service at Mad Onion was super slow!Would I stay here again? Yes, if I want to have fun on a budget.Wow!  They got me good....Booked through Orbitz so it's non-refundable.  Very old bldg (slump block) with equally old carpet & sheets.  Maybe worth $45 ... Not the nearly $200 I got taken for!Please I just hope there are no BED BUGS...No way do they EVER get repeat business!This place should be condemned...Please Mr. Wynn... Buy this & level it!Yes, the rooms are old.  The internet access is extremely slow and patchy in places.  Service varies, with stellar performance by the male pool bartender (gave us a tip- of all the frozen drinks Hooters serves, the Rum Punch has the most alcohol, versus the Pina Colada which has almost none) and lacking performance by the female bartender inside the Hooters restaurant (not even a smile - what's up with that?).HOWEVER:1) Summer special when booking online - $32 for the night, not including resort fees (about $14) and taxes.  This included:a) Two free frozen alcoholic drinks b) Platter of 10 free wingsc) $10 free slots play d) $10 free "match play"2) Sign up for a free card to play in the casino (necessary for your free slots play), and you'll get another coupon for $5 free "match play" and $5 free (price of a beer) at the restaurant.3) Check in offer at the bar - a free beer of your choice if you check in on Facebook or Twitter.  Sit at the bar and everyone in your party can check in apparently.4) Sign up for text messages from Hooters, and guess what? Another free plate of 10 wings!5) Sit at the bar when it's almost show-time, and there's a possibility a hypnotist will run by and hand you two free tickets.So, overall, we made more money off Hooters during this trip than they made off us. This is my first time to Vegas, but I'm pretty sure this isn't how it's supposed to work. Definitely worth a stay if you're a fan of good financial decisions.Hooters Hotel is exactly what you think it is. The image you have in your mind thinking of an expanding Hooters restaurant into a larger casino with rooms is spot on. They serve wings 24/7 which is great. So there are some great positives...1) The casino is small but because it is not huge the smoke is kept to a minimum and you arent walking through large clouds of smoke2) Their pool is very nicely organized and great for kids3)  $29 rooms are simple and affordable. No bells & whistles except for the coffee machine and TV. Which usually doesn't matter because all you do is sleep in them4) Free parking & Valet with room . You may not think this is important but it is huge.5) Just off the strip but close enough you can walk easily6) HOT showersSome meh's1) Despite being close to the airport you really cannot hear the airplanes so dont let that be a deterrent2) The room is like your college dorm. 4 Walls, a TV, beds and a desk. I had to ask 3 times for a chair to the desk. Do not expect a refrigerator and if you want one it will be $25/night. Considering we paid $29/night for the room, we just brought coolers and used their free ice. Saved a lot of time and money.3) Our beds had no bed bugs. yay!4) Thermostats were solid5) The TV is an old Zenith style..no HDMI for cheating on the laptop with moviesFinally, of course, negatives...1) Free, albeit slow compared to what you are used to, WIFI2) Resort fee of $15/night NOT included in booking.com regardless of what booking said (this is for the wifi, parking)3) Not a lot of hang out options and no buffet option4) Cell service in the rooms is terrible. I was gonna cheat on the wifi by hooking up my cell to the lappy but it got worse coverage. Again you probably dont care since you wont be in the room too often5) DO NOT believe booking sites. We asked for a king bed and got 2 queens. Here is the real thing: it's $29/night .So if you are looking for an inexpensive place to crash and plan on doing things elsewhere, this is a good deal. If you are looking for the extras like a spa or resort you will be very disappointed. Great for kids..great for singles..terrible for the rich & famous.The only thing that I give a five star to at this establishment was the pregnant hooter chick that  just served me my hot wings. For serious though.. she was pregnant as hell and I wish I got a photo with her and my crew. The rooms are very outdated with no HD TVs, good luck hooking your iPad up. It's our first night and if I don't update this post saying we got bit by motherfucking bedbugs, then the beds are safe. Wish me luck folks.Spent last weekend at Hooters for the first time with a large group, and had an unexpectedly great time! If you can get a good deal on the rooms, it's a pretty sweet value (check on Groupon or Priceline). I highly recommend asking for a King room if you're only traveling as a pair - the Double rooms are considerably jankier, no idea why. Spent one night in each and it was like night and day. It seems to be overlooked by many reviewers what the theme of this hotel is. Yes, hooters, but also cheesy 1980's decor - the clock radios your parents have, the Zenith TVs, and the wood-paneled headboards are part of the kitsch. Were you expecting the Wynn? LOL You're in *Hooters*! The girls are still wearing white sneakers and orange shorts, for crissakes. Speaking of which, I didn't actually see very many Hooters girls, maybe two the entire trip aside from the girls running the tables. The casino floor stays busy, even at 5 am, and people are rocking the pool during the day, even in January. A few too many families with little kids for my taste, but what can you do. Maybe Hooters has finally eclipsed Disneyland.In a pinch and with a deal, I'd come back in a second. Walking distance to the south Strip, right across the street from the MGM Grand for shows, etc., and has a couple decent restaurants inside. Check it out!Yeah this place seemed a lot dated. And if you're expecting to see a bunch of hotties walking around in orange dolphin shorts, you'll be disappointed. There is a Hooters restaurant in the "resort" but for the most part the only hotties you'll be seeing outside the restaurant will be driving a scooter, hooked up to an oxygen tank smoking a cigarette. Maybe that's your thing.Hooters hotel is a crack house with tits. The place was & still is disgusting. The room was full of cracks on the wall & our bathroom tub so was clogged,  it would fill up with dirty water when we showered. It got so bad we aventually switched crack house rooms to another some what cleaner crack house room. Eating; don't worry because the only thing ever open is the Hooters bar. Let me sum up my experience at the Hooters Hotel & Casino. While sitting at the bar a cockroach ran accross the bar, the bar tender attempted to smash it with a bottle opener. Do not stay here no mattet how good the deal is.DO NOT STAY HERE! This is one of the worse hotels I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in some pretty bad hotels. 1. The room was absolutely disgusting. Nothing was cleaned. There were chunks of hair throughout the room. There was a fake eyelash on the shower wall. There was leftover food on the desk. The mirrors had dirty finger prints all over them. The bathroom floor was not clean. I had to buy sanitizing wipes to wipe down all surface areas. 2. The room was outdated3. The hotel smelled horrible. As soon as I got off the elevator my gag reflex kicked in. I'm not sure how to describe it. The only good thing was that the staff was very friendly. However, my overall experience was just awful. I would rather have stayed at a motel 6. Anything would have been better than that hotelthe lobby and hall way smells.. but you cant blame them.. they're an older hotel.. the staff was nice.. especially one of the valet guys.. the corded phone in the room is just broken.. called a few times and they couldnt hear.. when they finally could we had asked for extra towels that never arrived.. had a hard time taking a shower.. the hot water was not hot enough and the shower made a really loud noise the whole time.. but at the end of the time.. you get what you pay for.. we didnt want to spend 150 a night at our regular spots.. it was 140 here for 2 nights! the powerball machine was really fun though..I booked this Hotel on Groupon, 8/21 to 8/23, This was the most disgusting room ever!!!Pictures speak volumes...:(If it was possible to give negative stars I would.  This place is filthy and poorly maintained.  I will never stay here again.

Review Text :
I think I had the #7 and the #41 add tofu. My friend John had the #8 and the #38 complete with fish balls....who knew...fish...had balls? Or was it the #6 and the #39. I don't know. I was distracted by the ambiance. Old tiled floors. Really funny, faux velvet art deco chairs and tables that could have used a little Windex. We were greeted immediately, sat, received water and then...well...waited and waited. I didn't want to be to rude but finally flagged someone down. You could tell this was a family run gig...dad type figure bussing tables, little kids running around with rice falling out of their mouths (seriously, it wasn't gross, but kinda sweet) and the big mama just kinda surveying the scene. Meanwhile the younger men ran the floor. Our order was finally taken and food was delivered swiftly. The spring rolls did not dissapoint....so fresh, so delicious...who needs a fried spring roll any more? The menu was so huge and intimidating I basically just pointed at something and blurted out the number. Taking the safe route was kind of boring I realize but the noodles were yummy, the veggies crisp and the tofu was amazing. I watched the other patrons (i.e. anybody that wasn't white) to see what they ordered. It was Pho all around. Next time it's Pho for Pho sure! Great experience. Would totally order a tray of those spring rolls for a party. And next time in addition to Pho I'll have Alexander C.'s fave Banh. He says it makes him horny you know!? Oh. The prices were unbelievably low! I could have paid the entire bill with change from the cracks of my sofa cushions.Pho.  I've missed it since moving to Arizona.  Tragic, I know.  Recently I became fixated on it.  Had to have it.  For a week it was pretty much the only meal I could think about.  Where, oh where to get it in Phoenix?  Lucky for me, I know people.  People who know where to go to feed my need for Pho.  Da Vang!Right when we walked into Da Vang, I knew it was going to be good.  It just looked, well, like it was supposed to.  A little worn, and more utilitarian than attractive - you know that everyone comes for the food, not the decor.The menu is pretty extensive - almost overwhelming, and conveniently numbered for people like me who would butcher the pronunciation of the dishes.  I should have taken more time to review, but I was on a mission.  A Pho-king mission and I wasn't leaving without it.To start, we enjoyed deliciously fresh spring rolls - one type with shrimp (#48) and the other with BBQ pork (#49).  Both were prepared with crisp refreshing mint leaves and went oh so well with the peanut dipping sauce.  Heaven!The beautiful big bowl of seafood pho (#12) that was placed before me was well worth waiting for.  Oh!  Shrimp, crab, squid and more!  Bathed in a succulent broth and surrounded by a hearty portion of rice-stick (thin) noodles.  Love these!  Seeing my friend's noodle envy, I surrendered a portion to add to his Pho, which came with thicker noodles (and looked awesome, too).  I like the burn, so I heated up my broth with chili sauce, sriracha, lime juice and even a couple jalapeno slices.  After a few bites my lips were on fire - perfect!My only regret is that there was no way that I could even consider dessert.  Physically impossible after all of the amazing food I had consumed.  I am sure they would have been good.  Well, I just have a reason to go back!Well worth the drive.  Da Vang, I know where to find you now, and plan on seeing you often!My friend Sage and I ate here this evening because we wanted to try some Vietnamese cuisine. I've heard good things about this place on yelp, so we decided to have dinner here. I'm sorry, but this place is sad! I hate giving 2 star ratings especially if it's a family owned business, but their service needs improvement! When we sat down, nobody bothered to check on us or even offer us water. After waiting and being ignored for about 5 minutes, we finally waved someone to give us water . Our waiter seemed a little impatient and when we ordered our drinks, the server just threw our beverages on the table, turned around and then walked away. We were like, what is his problem? Maybe he had a long day, but that's no excuse! When he finally took our order, half of the things I ordered weren't available. He kept saying they ran out and he seemed very short with me.Then why put 100 items in the menu if half of the items are not available?I am always nice to service industry, but this dude didn't even bother suggesting an alternate selection.Sage ordered a beef pho and I ordered a vegetarian noodle with tofu and vegetables. This place is not vegan friendly and all their pho is made with beef stock. Most of their dishes either contains animal tendons, pigs blood, tripe and other things i couldn't identify.   Then when we got our food, he didn't even bother to check on us to see if everything was satisfactory. I don't know why this place get 5 stars. It's not even a 5 star restaurant. It's in a sketchy strip mall and the restaurant is dirty. Stained ceilings and filthy floors. I would be scared to find out what the kitchen looks like. Sure you get good value for your money and they give you large portions, but the service and atmosphere left much to be desired.JD Invades AZ Day 3:I know what you all are thinking: you flew over 600-miles just to eat Pho? Well ordinarily you're right--I would never go to AZ to eat Pho in 90-degree heat, especially since we have World Class Pho back home in San Jose. However, my good Yelp bud, Laz C, had never had Pho before and as the unofficial Pho-King of Yelp, it was my duty--nay! Privilege to take his Pho-Cherry away. So, we did our research and Da Vàng (DV) was the most convenient Pho spot to Laz's work. So we hooked up on a sunny and warm Phoenix Spring Day. Here are our chronicles:48: Goi Cuon Tom Thit (Spring Rolls)- I was not too impressed with DV's Spring Rolls; the Rice Paper was too thick and sticky and the spring rolls themselves weren't as fresh as I'm used to. Also, instead of Peanut Sauce they served them up with a cup of Hoisin Sauce sprinkled with Peanuts. I'm not sure if that's customary in certain types of Vietnam, or what, but that's not the way we roll in SJ. 2.5*1B: Pho Da Vàng Xe Lua (Pho sliced beef, brisket, tendon, tripe, and beef meatballs): Broth- I was surprised how good DV's broth was because, to be honest, I was expecting some fake wanna-be Pho out here in the Desert where most people don't know any better. It didn't have some of the nice subtle complexity that Pho broth can have, but the beefy flavor was on point. 3.75*Noodles- Standard Pho noodles and they hook you up pretty good with the amount. Now, if they had fresh noodles I would've been way impressed, but alas you can't get everything. 3*Meat- The meat was pretty good, but they weren't very generous with it. I was too engrossed in our conversation to remember to order the steak raw on the side-- Pho-Jester is more like it. 3*44: Com Ga Nuong (Steamed Rice with BBQ Chicken)- I ordered this for my 3-year-old and was surprised he ate the tomatoes and most of the chicken. He's pretty picky so I'll have to rate it based on his discerning palate. 4* (Lance rating)Service & Ambiance- Pretty standard Pho service in that you get the minimum number of visits to your table, but at least they were friendly and didn't grunt at us. DV is located in a pretty suspect Phoenix neighborhood; I wasn't 100% sure, but Laz confirmed it as I guess he used to live close by once upon a time. With that being said, it wasn't super-ghetto, but ghetto enough to add to the charm. 3.5*-service/4*-ambianceValue- I was surprised how cheap the Pho prices are here compared to SJ; where a bowl of Pho is averaging around $8, DV's average price is around $5. Great value for what it is. 5*I'd like to thank Laz again for letting me be his guide into the world of Pho and for being a fantastic dining companion. As for DV, I'd say they deserve an overall 3.5-star but I'll give them the 4-star bump because I was pleasantly surprised for AZ and they have a tremendous value.
Grape Street=YASMG!!(Yet Another Strip Mall Gem)3.65 stars.  Not quite a solid 4 but pretty darn close.I like the deliberate decor.  Much more interesting than I expected in a strip mall.  Warm textures and soft lighting as well as exposed brick.The service was predominantly very good.  There was a moment when one of my coworkers received his salad and was surprised that it had cheese.  He hadn't read the menu and it didn't occur to him that a house salad would come with blue cheese.  The waiter was a little put off that he didn't want the cheese on the salad but then returned it and brought out another salad minus cheese.I had the penne ala vodka which came with asparagus, asiago, basil, prosciutto and a nice vodka sauce, portion size was good.Based on my visit I would return to try other selections.***This review is for the bar counter service only***This is a really hard review for me to write....why?  Because I love this place, but last night the service was so bad I have to give it 2 Stars.The Better Half and I enjoy going out to places that offer flights of wine.  We enjoy sampling different vineyards without the cost of paying for a full glass of wine.  Grape Street is our go to place for this.  Normally we dine at a table and enjoy a full meal with our flights.  However, last night we decided to go to the bar because we didn't plan to eat.  It was a mistake.The bartender's service was horrible.  We had to get our own menus.  We each ordered a flight of the Zinfandels and glasses of water.  Once she poured the flights of wine, she didn't bother to tell us anything about the wine.  Normally, they will tell you which glass contains which wine and will give you a brief description of the taste & flavors.  She was more concerned with this guy who was sitting at the bar.  Keep in mind that there was only 5 people at the bar including my Wife & I when we arrived.  Within 20 minutes, there was only 3 of us remaining at the bar.....she spent all of her time chatting up the other customer.  Meanwhile, our glasses of water sat empty.I finished my flight before the Better Half finished hers.....that's always the case.  I was interested in having another glass and was considering one of the Cabs....however, she was nowhere to be found.  The bar was left unattended and who knows where she went.  Finally, she appeared with food for the other customer.  I waited until she delivered his order, then I flagged her down....she says "Just one second".....then she bolts from the bar.....what the ??  I watched her as she walked around the restaurant and she came back empty handed.....what was so freaking important that you couldn't take a drink order from a customer at the bar?  When she finally came over, I asked if I could sample one of the Cabs before I made my decision......she said "sure" and poured me a small sample of the Cab I requested.  Then, she walked away to do something else in the back.....didn't she want to know if I wanted to order a full glass?  Come on!  By this time, the Better Half said screw this.....let's go have a glass of wine somewhere else where we will be served.A server from the restaurant came to the bar, looked over at us and could see we were irritated....asked if we needed anything, I said Check Please.  She went in the back and found the bartender....who came over and said "Didn't you want another glass of wine?"......ha, not tonight and not with your crappy service.  I paid the check and we were on our way to another place.I didn't get the bartender's name, but she had dirty blond curly hair.....I remember who she is because when we come back, I will be sure to avoid the bar if she's working.This place use to be so much better than this.  I don't know what's going on.Will I return?  Yes, but will only sit at the bar if she's not the bartender.  We'll sit in the dining area if necessary.Monday night is a great time to stop by this off-the-strip neighborhood restaurant because bottles of wine are 50% off. The food was better than expected, too. One of their more popular items is baked brie ($13). It's a hunk of brie sitting on top of caramelized onions and wrapped in flaky and delicate pastry. It's a massive baseball-sized mound with a knife piercing the top. It's surrounded by toast, pear, apples, and grapes. This is one appetizer meant to be shared.The mussels ($13) were tough, but the white wine sauce that they were sitting in was phenomenal. Any bread that we had left over was used to sop up every last drop of sauce.The caesar salad was decent and the tomato soup was creamy and full of flavor, but too chilled for my liking.The chicken parmesan ($21) was good, but standard fare. The three thin breasts of chicken were coated in a breading that didn't stand a chance of staying crispy under all the sauce and cheese poured on top of it. A side of spaghetti accompanied the dish.The ribeye special was beautifully charred and still tender and medium rare in the interior. It can't compete with top steakhouses in quality, but the wine and mushroom sauced boldly enhanced the flavor. A few carrots, asparagus, and potatoes surrounded the steak.The restaurant isn't exactly kid-friendly, but there were several kids around, including ours. There's no kid's menu but they were happy to make a plain grilled chicken breast and fries for our little one.On a second visit we started with their tapas plate. The Greek meatballs were the best thing on the plate. Savory and full of bold flavors, I wish there were more than three of them. The other items -- the goat cheese cigars, olives, and vegetables were decent, but paled in comparison to the meatballs.The plating of the caprese salad was different than your typical caprese. The end caps of the tomatoes were sliced off and stacked with mozzarella and topped with toasted pine nuts and balsamic vinegar and olive oil.We shared the short rib entree and the kitchen was nice enough to split the dish on to separate plates. I enjoyed the the depth of flavor of the sauce, although it was a touch sweet. But, the beef was too tough. Add to that a dry, chalky risotto and a minuscule serving of carrots and it was mediocre dish.Service was spotty on both visits. The first time due to our waiter being asked to wait on numerous tables scattered around the restaurant. The second time the waiter and kitchen staff were hanging out at the bar watching a Notre Dame game.Grape Street is a clear notch below the top off-strip restaurants, but it's worth a return visit.3.5 StarsReading through a lot of reviews - I've been surprised at how people have rated this place. This is the first place my boyfriend took me out on a date to and we've come here on a quarterly basis if not more for the last 2-3 years. People say it's too dark...they have lights at every table - it's supposed to be a more chill mood to eat in, and you can see the menus.The only reason I did not give the place 5 stars is because of the service. We've always had good to great service here. I've never had horrendous service in all of the times that I've been here. The only problem I see is that they seem understaffed by 1-2 people. This place gets insanely busy on most evenings and especially on the weekends. The waiters seem to be a bit overwhelmed at times, but never rude. Another thing - people complain it's overpriced. First of all, they have half off wine on Mondays. That's a rarity. And think of all of the other places you drink wine or beer at. Everywhere is over priced for alcohol. They have to, in order to make money. This place does not do anything in the price difference compared to other $$ cost restaurants in town. With the food - come on, guys. It is not overpriced. It is a higher quality than you're going to find walking in any chain restaurant. If you want cheaper prices, go stroll down the street until you find yourself in an Applebees. They offer fresh fish. Not fried fish sticks. The top dishes I recommend - Anything with Halibut or seabass. Most of the times I come here, I get fish - and I'm not a fish lover. But they always have the best sauces that compliment the fish so well. The filet oscar - each time we've had it, it's cooked perfectly to our request, topped with crab and it's served with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It's very flavorful and very tender. The pork chops. I love them here. I'm always scared to get them at restaurants. They never seem to taste right and it's always with weird sauces. The pork chops here are thick, juicy and they have a great sweet wine sauce served on top. I love that they always have a good amount of specials on the board too.I'm pretty sure there isn't anything here that I haven't enjoyed. I've had so much, but there is a reason why we keep going back. AND there is a reason why this place is always busy - IT'S GOOD AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD. ;)Don't let these bad reviews scare you away - try it for yourself.Great service, crab salad is the best but above all dog friendly patio that is covered so our family & friends don't burn.Please see my picture for the reason behind my dislike of this establishment. It shows an apple slice accompanying the Baked Brie with the sticker still on it and sliced through. Is it a big deal? Not for you in your own house, but in a restaurant such as this? Yes, it is a big deal. It reflects poorly on the overall mentality of this place and provides insight into the way they cut corners...1. This apple was likely not washed2. Those that prepare the food are lazy without attention to detail...how was this apple cut through a sticker much less plated without someone noticing and pulling it off??3. If they cut corners here, they cut corners elsewhereAs a result, I was very critical regarding the rest of my meal, here are some additional findings:- the Baked Brie was completely overcooked: the phyllo was an empty shell, what used to be solid brie was now mostly unconstituted liquid fat covering the plate- the pear slices accompanying the Baked Brie were incredibly over-ripe and should not have been served- I also ordered the Penne ala Vodka with chicken which came with pancetta and asparagus pieces in the pasta. I counted, in this dish there was only 1 piece of asparagus which was the tip of a spear, every other chunk was from the body with most being the very fibrous chunks from the bottom (which should not be utilized). I relived my meal on the way home as I tried to excavate asparagus fibers from between my molars.Grape Street - if you're going to charge me $18 for a pasta dish (which is .35 cents worth of pasta + a few chunks of things and sauce), it better be top notch...it wasn't.This place gets an F
Long Wong's Hot Wings=Okay, so I'm realllyyyyy freaking picky when it comes to my wings. I don't do Hooters wings. I don't do Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't do Pizza Hut wings. I think I've only had one dozen wings that I went kind of nuts over... and that was yesterday at Long Wong's.Luckily, one of my girlfriends knew how ridiculous I am when it comes to wings but insisted we check this place out. Ghetto area. The girl at the counter wore black lipliner. The customers looked like they just got out of prison...HOWEVER! The wings were out of this world. Saucy, full of flavor, and cheap. Extra veggies, extra ranch... no charge. We ate so many wings + chili cheese fries, and I felt like a heffer when we were done. SUCCESS!
Pepe's Taco Villa=Pepe. Can I call you Pepe? Here's the deal. Salsa squeezed out of a bottle. Not so great. It runs all over my plate making it difficult to scoop up. In a bowl or ramekin would be nice. Chips were good however. Service. Well. Let's just say I had VIP service as I was with three hot Latinas. Yep. Gay gringo + Hot Latinas = stellar service. Excelente!Tamales? Why are they a reddish orangey color? Sad. They were dry, not very sweet (like I imagine Nicole Kidman would be) and well, did I mention sad? The pork filling, however was succulent and tasty. Kinda what I imagine Ryan Reynolds would taste like. My friend's chicken soup was ORGASMIC. Or as they say in Spanish. ORGASMICO. You see. You just add an O and you're bilingual. Order the soup my yelpitas. Be. The soup. And. The margaritas. Well, when you're day drinking and starting at 11:30 am (hey it's 5:00 somewhere, right?) it doesn't take long to catch a buzz. I mean, I''m still tasting my vanilla mint crest with the first sips. But the margs were very smooth, tart and just enough kick.Cut to me floating in my friends' pool after lunch. Happy. Feliz I should say. But wishing I had stuck with my first choice of carnitas or had ordered the chicken soup. Next time. Or. El tiempo proximo. Pepe. I don't care if you're in the hood. I felt so street and edgy. I'll be back. And thank you for commenting on my Hello Kitty debit card Jose! You rawk mi carnes y quesos!If you're looking for the best mole' in town, it might just be hiding at Pepe's Taco Villa.I hadn't been to PTV before (it not really in my neighborhood walking radius...I clock it at just under 22 miles round trip).It might be worth the trip:)I've certainly tried the mole's in a lot of places, and some are pretty decent...I know mole' is a style thing, more than an absolute (the "right" amount of chocolate...the right "umami", etc., so when I say that Los Sombrero's mole' is kind of "mediocre" and the mole' at Frank and Lupe's (which used to be pretty decent) would now be better if they just poured a can of unsweetened Hershey's syrup over chicken tartare...you know I mean those minor critiques with love:)I played squash on Saturday...(squash, the sport of the privileged and effete East Coast elite intelligentsia, who would be dismayed (to put it mildly) to find me playing "their" game:)I played in an event to raise money to make squash an Olympic sport in a few years (yeah, I know...good luck with that, but if they have fencing, why not?)After playing for over an hour straight (best anaerobic sport on the planet...burns more than 1400 calories an hour)...I was hungry!My erstwhile opponent, Wes, the affable and probably not corrupt attorney, suggested PTV. Wes's wife went to high school with the owners and he said they had great mole's.3 chicken mole' enchiladas later, I am inclined to agree. Wes and the family (I'm like an uncle to those kids...Uncle Buck:) chatted with Jose, one of the owners, when we arrived and I got a chance to say "hello" too.I got a little bit of the history of the place...used to be owned by the parents, used to be smaller and more intimate (something I always like in a taco shop...PTV isn't small any longer).We got chips and salsa...pretty good chips and better salsas, although the 2 kinds of salsa came in squeeze bottles (I am really more of a "dunker" than "squeezer" when it comes to salsa...it was fine...you just have to make a little volcano of both kinds of salsa and use 2 chips to push things around...but I don't really like to have to work the chip thing that hard:)The enchiladas came and heavens to murgatroid, they were tasty!!! Pronounced chocolate flavor, not too salty, with the just the right amount of bitterness from the unsweetened Mexican chocolate:) The chocolate blended with the grilled chicken flavor and the sweetness of the corn tortillas to produce an outstanding enchilada. I also ordered the Olla beans...highly recommended! You can get refries anywhere and I doubt that PTV's are significantly (or any) better than others. But they put a bunch of jalapeno's in the pot to make these pot beans a cut above the rest:)They say that chocolate accesses the same brain chemistry that sex does, and I think that might have been the case with my enchilada's:)But, I was there with Wes and his family...they were kind enough to invite me along and show me where to get good mole'...a full on foodgasm would have just been wrong...even for me:)ode to a Chilaquiles.so i ate some Chilaquiles at Pepe's the other morning. not ever having Chilaquiles before i was not sure if my Chilaquiles was good or great, but the Chilaquiles was good to me. very tasty Chilaquiles that is. i had my Chilaquiles with hard fried eggs because i'm not a fan of runny yoke. my Chilaquiles egg was only 85% to my requested hard fried, resulting in a missing star. tho my Chilaquiles was very good. my Chilaquiles was made with a tomatoes salsa texture of sauce..watery in a way..but not knowing how Chilaquiles should look..i thought it was good. Chilaquiles.the tortilla chips are also good. and i kinda liked the squeeze bottles. cause i just squeeze it onto a chip and put it in my mouth. tasty salsas..i squirted a bunch onto my Chilaquiles egg that wasn't fried enough..so i didn't notice the runny texture. Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles. the beans with my Chilaquiles had white cheese on them, alot of mexican restuarants use a handful of yellow cheese so i was impressed..it wasn't crumble queso-fresco..but it was still tasty with my Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles.ok i think i have used Chilaquiles eighteen times now..umm ok nineteen times...so to finish off with an even twenty...Chilaquiles. yummm. ohh btw they take bank cards now.When I worked on the west side, I would pass by a small Mexican import store every day on my way to work. I knew it was there from the random Mexican furniture displayed on the sidewalk. I never thought in a million years, I would ever actually step foot into that place, but then one day my boss at the time took me to lunch and yes, we ended up at Pepe's. The Mexican furniture lined the sidewalk as I approached the restaurant, and I'm not sure if it's attached to Pepe's or just conveniently located next door, but it definitely adds to the authenticity of the restaurant. This is truly a restaurant where you can't judge it by its cover and questionable location on the outside. Once you step foot inside, it's a fun and divey little Mexican food shop. Prices are extremely low and the food is good. The salsa has a nice kick to it and the food is pretty high in calories but also high in taste. I like Pepe's for a decent west-side option for lunchtime. It's a quick, tasty and cheap option for a sit-down restaurant. The Mexican decor on the walls adds to the experience and I could just as easily be in a little restaurant in Cabo instead of being in a restaurant on Camelback and 21st Ave. This is definitely a spot worthy of checking out if you're in the area during lunchtime and looking for a tasty lunch time treat.
Carolina Soda Shoppe=Park Road Shopping center isn't like most strip malls.  Instead of boring, ubiquitous businesses like Subway and Sally's Beauty Supply, Park Road offers an eclectic collection of local restaurants, toy stores, book stores and other boutiques.  Sometimes it feels like walking back into the 1960s, but honestly that's part of the charm.No business personifies this more than the Carolina Soda Shoppe.  From great burgers and shakes to fried okra and applesauce, the menu has something for everyone's taste.  The restaurant is tiny with maybe 10 tables in total.  That said, I've never seen it so busy that I've had to wait very long.This place is definitely a local business; its owner clearly attends a nearby church and has prominently placed what I would call "Christian Kitsch" throughout the establishment.  There's even a sign up front that says if you bless your food you'll get a treat.  I'm not religious but if I can pray my way to a milkshake, sign me up.The food is good; not spectacular, but good.  The burgers are not the best but they're darn tasty.  It definitely hits the spot when all I want is a cheeseburger and some fries.  I highly suggest trying the fried okra as well.I was going to give three stars because this place is so low key and "average", but honestly it's not trying to be anything else.  If you're expecting a high-end diner, go somewhere else.  If you want good, simple food at a comfortable local joint, this is your place.
Thai Grill=Thai Grill and I have a long history.  Starting nearly five years ago, I started eating authentic Bangkok-style Thai food here on a weekly basis.  Some of you might remember Pock and his family's unique, gourmet Thai food during that time.  About a year ago, ownership changed, and the food changed... starting the beginning of this year there is yet a new owner with new recipes, especially Northern and Southern Thailand recipes.  Here is my updated review for Thai Grill over several visits.Pad See Ew - Fresh Chinese broccoli, fairly well prepared chicken.  The sauce is a little heavier than it used to be, and slight bit sweeter.  However, it is still a good version of this classic Thai dish.  I would say that it compares to the style of Pad See Ew at Kung Fu.Pineapple Fried Rice ($9.99) - Very well done.  Lighter, and a little less flavorful than the old Thai Grill fried rice, but not greasy at all.  They started using fresh pineapples again, which gives the dish the properly fruity-sweet flavor that it is supposed to have.  I enjoyed it.Kang-Pa, Jungle Curry ($8.99) - A Northern Thai spicy fish sauce curry soup (no coconut) with bamboo, various peppers, galanga, choice of meat, and a whole lot of taste.  This is a very authentic curry, and I loved how th curry flavor mixed with the fish sauce.  I haven't had a lot of Northern Thai dishes, but this was definitely much nicer than the Northern Red Curry at LoS.  I wouldn't recommend this for folks who aren't adventurous, but if you are then this is a great dish to try.Hung-Ley ($8.99) - This is a pork base with a homemade curry (not coconut curry) type sauce on it.  The pork was cooked similar to pot roast.  It was extremely tender, and expertly prepared.  The taste over rice was amazingly great.  I highly recommend trying this one.Duck Noodles (10.99) - This came with a regular egg noodle, duck, Chinese broccoli, and various herbs.  The broth reminded me of pho, and wasn't spicy at all.  I added some chili powder to spice it up, and it probably could have also benefited from the sour sauce in hind sight.  The duck was well prepared.  Overall I would order this again for people who aren't into the stronger tasting Thai dishes.Nam-Tod (8.99) - This is a deep fried pork dish over a vinegary sauce and light salad.  The fried pork was flaky and simply amazing.  I am not a huge fan of fried foods, but the way the pork was prepared was simply amazing.  If you like to explore, try this one out.  The vinegar sauce was not overpowering, and was well balanced (unlike most vinegar sauces at Thai restaurants).  You can tell that the cook knows how to balance flavors properly. Red Curry w/Beef ($7.99) - So far my only real disappointment, if you could call it that, but it wasn't that bad compared to most Thai restaurants in Vegas.  This is the first coconut based curry I have had here.  It had a light, but unique flavor.  It definitely could have used more umph to it though.  the server promised that the curry can be made spicier for us next time.  With some chili powder though, it was still a good curry.Khao Soi ($7.99) - YUM!  This has fresh, yummy noodles, and a well balanced yellow curry.  I loved their version of the dish.  It comes in a huge bowl, so it is bound to fill you up.  The best part about this dish is the yellow curry, which is rich and flavorful (not sweet).  Desserts - the Fried banana and sweet sticky rice are perfect.  I've only had "better" fried banana at TSNH, but even that is a toss up... these were very lightly fried, which made them easier on the stomach than TSNH.  The sweet sticky rice (with or without mango depending on the season), is again expertly prepared.  The sweet coconut based sauce saturates the rice, making it very sweet (not candy sweet though), but somehow doesn't make the rice soggy.  You've got to try this one if you are a fan of this classic Thai dessert.Final thoughts: the new cook, Natta, knows how to balance Thai food, and at the same time keep it strong and unique.  The food is about as authentic as it gets.  The menu is absolutely huge, featuring different regions of Thailand; you are bound to find a dish that you have never heard of/tried before.  I will definitely return on a regular basis!UPDATE/WARNING: In my opinion, Thai Grill has two modes: Slightly Americanized, and Authentic.  The Americanized versions aren't bad at all.  The main thing is that the base recipes are well done.  Some people might not like the added sugar/toned down Thai flavors of the Americanized versions.  If you are one of those people, be sure to tell your server to make the authentic, strong stuff!
Schlotzsky's=I am completely amazed that I am the first one to be reviewing this place.A one of a kind deli. The sandwiches are enormous with very unique round rolls, deli meats & cheeses plus they have some of the best soup around.They also have pizzas,wraps and salads.I usually get a roast beef & cheese sandwich and Wisconsin cheese soup with chips & a drink plus tip under $20.The have a dozen or so tables inside and a drive thru so eat in or take-out. Good Eats!I'm a long time Schlotzsky's fan. Been eating her since I was a kid and I still love it. It's funny because until a few years ago I didn't realize that I much prefer sourdough bread... so that probably explains why I love this place. My favorite is the turkey, original style but with only turkey (no pork) Every once and a while I'll get the one with avocado... but honestly the regular sandwich is so good I don't think it needs anything extra. I'm also thrilled that the location by my work carries China Mist Passion Fruit Black Tea (my absolute favorite iced tea) I love it!!!The chip selection leaves a little to be desired, but I'm not coming here for the chips. Staff at this location is always extremely helpful and patient... I'm usually ordering for several co-workers and don't always have my ducks in a row.I can't remember ever having sampled a Schlotzky's sandwich before this summer, but I heard my friend extoll their virtues many times as we planned our trip to Las Vegas.  She insisted we HAD to eat at a Schlotzky's before we left.  We were staying down on the strip, but we used our Yelp app to locate this Schlotzky's and guide us here.The first thing I noticed upon entering were the bright red paint on the walls. It really is quite striking at first.  There was a television in the corner, and this sandwich shop is jam packed full of tables.  They were definitely trying to maximize the usable space.The next thing I noticed was a neon sign proudly declaring that their bread is baked fresh daily.  That's certainly a good sign.  I walk up to the counter to peruse the menu and order.  I decide that I MUST try the Albuquerque Turkey sandwich (ha ha that rhymes) sandwich consisting of smoked turkey breast, crispy strips of bacon, mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan cheeses, fire roasted veggies, lettuce, tomatoe, chipotle mayo - are you drooling yet? - on a freshly bakes Jalapeno cheese bun. OH YEEEEEEEEAH!  It was the perfect sandwich to introduce me to Schlotzky's and I must say I immediately became a fan.I grabbed a bag of chips - oooooooh, excitement, they have two different flavors of baked chips, regular and barbeque.  I head over to the soda fountain to get a drinkzsky (their cutesy term, not mine).  Bummer, the only diet soda option is Diet Coke, but they do have three kinds of tea: passion fruit, unsweetened, and Southern sweet tea.Last cutezsky note: There is a sign on the wall announcing that they do catering "we're haulin bunz" and the restrooms are labeled "manly bunz" and shapely bunz prompting me to contemplate what one does if they have shapely man bunz?Enquiring minds want to know!
Maxim Restaurant=Dumpy little place with killer food. I tried the sesame chicken lunch special. It was hot and sour soup, egg roll, white rice and lightly breaded chicken covered in brown sauce and sesame seeds. There was not one thing that was bad. It was all good. Under $7 bucks out the door.Maxim is the perfect spot to get your soup on. I've been a few times this year and usually get cravings on days when the weather is cool or rainy.  On our most recent visit, we were running late, actually they had just turned off the "open" sign. However, when the owners noticed our disappointed faces they waived us back in along with a couple behind us who were just as happy to receive the same treatment.  This alone secures a few stars for feeding us after hours.  Thanks Maxim!On this visit, we had a heaping bowl (shared by two) of wonton noodle soup that allowed for seconds. The soup contained pork, shrimp and stuffed wontons. The broth was tasty and the noodles cooked perfectly.  I've yet to try a soup meal that wasn't excellent. Our second item was the pork and shrimp pancake which I especially like and order every time. It's more like a stuffed crape than a pancake and is very good.  Each meal was served with loads of salad items such as lettuce, cilantro, lime, mint and jalapeños.  You can add these to your meals along with any of the condiments at the table. Yes, they have Sriracha! Other items I've enjoyed that have me returning time after time are the spring rolls and the Pho. The Pho is insanely good. The portion is huge so share with a friend.The only thing that's a little off is the music that's played while dinning. The music was serenading cats meowing. At first I thought it was crying babies but nope, cats.  This is an interesting feature that will take some getting used to, for me at least. Enjoy!writing this review is so tiresometo switch things up and blatently plagiarize a yelp friends writing style im going w/ a rating systemwith a sliding scale of 1-10 ten obviously being the best, 1 the worst:8 food2 service3 ambience9 pricei was thoroughly prepared to enjoy maxim, and while the food didnt disappoint, the unabashed contempt the server/owner? showed me was regrettable. I enjoyed my Pho, it was delicious...well i think technically it was Mi but i digress- the soup was stellar. A large bowl of egg noodles floating in a golden pork based broth, healthy portions of chicken shrimp and some type of spongy pork meat , fresh veggies and herbs to infuse the soup w/ an abundance of flavour. it was delicious, simply put. But. but but but but; the minute i walked up to the door i was greeted with seeming hostility. to note the door was locked, and the open sign turned off, this at 4:20 ish? i checked the hours on the window, checked my cell phone, and looked back at the two little asian women inside in confusion and charming befuddlement. The younger lady, begrudgingly stopped her sweeping and unlocked the door, "you eating here?!" she barked, "whaa, uhh yeah. are you guys open" she glared at me and held the door open. I stood there akwardly and she grabbed flatware and ushered me to my seat, whereupon she actually pulled out my seat for me (actually a kind hearted gesture now that i think about it). i sat and waited, ordered spring rolls (hard to mess up, but they were awesome to note) and my soup. yada yada the meal comes i eat it in quiet enjoyment. a group of four comes in, and then another group, and after that i was ignored the remainder of my stay. i was ignored for soooo long. i sat in quiet frustration/agony waiting for my bill, and a container for the remainder of my soup. after about 30 minutes she deigned to look at me, and acknowledge that i was ready to leave. i ask for the bill and a container. she gives me both, and as i was slowly pulling out my wallet, she stood there and stared. i tried to sign the bill as slow as possible, so that she wouldnt see that i was going to stiff her on her tip, so she picked up my soup and poured it into the container all the while watching my signature out of the corner of her eye, almost bullying me into tipping her, which i did, reluctantly. All in all.....i would come back, but only for a to go order.
Little Caesars Pizza=I very much wavered between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. I opted for 3 mainly due to the sheer entertainment value that it provides and lately the service has been much better than it used to be. A nice takeout fast food pizza joint that I am old enough to remember back in the 1980's serving square pizza. Those days are long gone and what now puts them on the map is $5 large pepperoni pizzas available "Hot 'n Ready" for immediate pickup and a great last minute family dinner value. For $3 more you can opt for the "Three Meat Treat" or Deep Dish, but I recommend calling ahead for those as they are often not available for immediate pickup. This restaurant was largely remodeled a while back and now has dark wood fixtures and displays. The staff is young and not particularly customer friendly but adequate and efficient. It is often entertaining when you call or walk in as you can often hear and see the kids yelling at each other over various things. Oh to be young again...I've been a customer of this Caesars for years and must say that service has improved greatly. There was a time when it would be busy and even after calling ahead, you could expect a half hour to 45 minute wait time. That seems to be alleviated now as I always call ahead and my order is usually available for pickup upon arrival. Overall, I recommend this place for a quick value pizza and a particularly efficient last minute dinner choice for the family. Just remember to call ahead to be safe.
Aladdin's Eatery- Pittsburgh- Squirrel Hill=I've been to the Aladdin's in Mt Lebo and the North Hills and been totally unimpressed.  When my friend wanted to come here, I was over it.  However, this Aladdin's was a good experience.I ordered a falafel wrap ($8.31 with tax) since I had previously been unimpressed with options including meat.  The wrap was awesome.  The falafel was delicious and hot, and it was balanced well.  In Pittsburgh, this is probably the best falafel you can get.  The hummus was also amazing, and I could probably eat it with just a spoon.Overall, a good place for lunch in Squirrel Hill.
Kay's Kafe=good breakfast. just moved to the area and found this place online.  seems like some trucker diner you'd find off the interstate, but inside was nicely remodeled, and food was awsome for breakfast.  most amazing fluffy and huge pancakes.  ommelete and hash browns were nicely prepared, not greasy and filling, but just the right touch of butter.  service was stellar.Your major is sociology and the assignment is exploring idiosyncrasies of various counter cultures. But you procrastinated when the professor was doling out the choices. Now there are only two left. Rednecks and Bikers.You choose the former, but now comes the dilemma. Where in Phoenix can you study rednecks in their natural habitat? (bars and brothels excluded)Well look no further. Kay's is your first stop. Kay's is located in an industrial section of Phoenix surrounded by farms, nearby cattle ranches and all around shit.Surrounded by junkyards, (replete with junkyard dogs) - packs of wild dogs roaming the streets and a gigantic garbage dump next door -  Kay's offers the finest in redneck watching.Yes,the people who harbor these dogs, drive combines, milk cows, and do garbage dumpy stuff all light here, at Kay's.Yes, Kay's will deliver that down-home atmosphere you're seeking, that is, if down home happens to be the back woods of West Virginia.Home to the dentifrice challenged, Kay's is where men wear Wranglers, Roper boots, and all things Carrhart. No fancy jeans here.Here you'll find men whose musk isn't Old Spice or Axe, but Dow Chemical's #105 or Union Carbide's Weevil 'B Gone. Go inside, take a seat and eavesdrop on the next table, let's get started with that assignment, shall we?Redneck breakfast-goer:  "N  I told that little brown puke, this here's Amerca boy, 'n if you don't like it,you can gettttt  the fuuuuckkkk out!, you lil rice-eatin, bean-fartin motherfucker."Redneck's little buddy:  "N  whad he say Earll?"Redneck:   "Lil sumbitch jumped in his '64 Impala 'n made tracks, probably fer Me-hee-co." Little buddy:  "Sposin you tol him Earll."I love going to Kay's for breakfast, but never lunch, even though their lunch specials are to die for. Especially the cheeseburger - one of the best in Phoenix.The breakfasts,especially if you get there around sun up when you'll get to see all these scourilous knaves in their natural habitat, sipping coffee, wolfing lumberjack specials even Denny's would envy, are the total shit!I typically get a bowl of cream of wheat and a couple poached eggs. It comes to nine bucks with coffee and the tip. A little pricey but not when you consider you're smack dab in the middle of a cornucopia of societal throwbacks.Well worth it. I love going to Kay's. Listening in on the conversations. Wondering just how it is Phoenix managed to adopt a little piece of Appalachia in its own backyard.And being a part of a contra culture Jeff Foxworthy would drool over.Note: I should probably mention the owners are nicest folks you'll ever meet and, there are a lot of police in here too. Police must identify with rednecks I suppose.One more thing.Since I gave you the tip on Kay's, I expect to be included in your footnotes.
The Original Wineburger="I Like Big Buns and I can't lie" I Saw A Nice Pair of Buns at Original Wineburger.   they are toasted and shinny, check the website for your self, if you a bun guy like me.  The Owner told me that he has one location and is not affiliated with any of the other Wineburgers.      I knew i was in for a real hamburger that I can't make at home.  Im very skeptical of the next burger spot since there's ten's of thousands of places offering the same promise of a great burger.What stands out, the size the there burger is inviting and all the ingredients were fresh.The place was packed when I entered and now I know why.  Its a cool look, the bar has the stove right behind it so its like your in a kitchen and bar at the same time.  Original Wineburger has truly stood the test of time and continues to please its customers with a great burger.  I m ready  to go back to order more of the items, the price is set to what you want, know I see why it starts at a moderate price and skyrockets, an $20 burger, anyone else have the confidence to sell at this price?

Bob Taylor's Ranch House=What do you do after a four mile hike?  Try a new place for lunch with your hiking mates.  This is what landed us at Bob Taylor's Ranch House late this morning.Two of us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I'd make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.For dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it's huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.Service was terrific--perhaps because we were the only people in the restaurant.  I have a feeling that our server would have been almost as attentive if there had been 5 tables occupied.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.After all the years of seeing the signs for this place or seeing ads, I'm glad we gave it a try.  I have a feeling that when we hike Mount Charleston and add lunch to our rigors, we'll stop here again!This is an old time restaurant that has some charm.  I have been a regular at this place for years, but I have noticed that the last year or so the management and owner simply don't care any more.   The cooks can't get the temperature of a steak right and always try to make you feel that you don't understand the difference between mid rare and mid well.  I normally go to the restaurant for their prime rib, which used to be in my opinion the best in town.  The problem now is that they try to pass medium as rare.  The cooks attitude is horrible and as I said the owner is never there and nobody cares except for a couple of servers that are helpless to do anything.Their lunches have gone down hill as well. This place has no charm left and is not worth spending your money at.This ended up being Plan B after the debacle that was "Bastille Day" at a restaurant that rhymes with "Barche Macchus" when they offered to seat us in a storage room.  I've had this place bookmarked for 3 years and it was finally time, baby!Bob Taylor's Ranch House is a throwback in so many ways from the cowboy decor, to the music and even menu.  Just the entrance itself is photoworthy!  I felt like I was at some roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Seeing the chef turning all those steaks as the hostess walked us to our table had me salivating big time!We got the cajun shrimp appetizer which was just ok.  While the flavor was nice, the shrimp was a little on the small side.  We still ended up soaking up all the sauce with the complimentary "garlic cheese toast".  The wife got the filet (rare) and I got the bone-in ribeye (medium rare) after much encouragement from our friendly waitress.  The ribeye was a massive 24 oz's of which I was only able to finish half of.  I usually prefer rare steaks but when it comes to the ribeye cut, I prefer it a little more cooked so I can appreciate all the parts of it from the outside char to the tender center and everything in between.  $42.99 for a ribeye seems cheap these days haha.  The filet mignon was very tender with great flavor. All entrees come with your choice of soup (it was a not bad lobster bisque) or salad (avoided based on Jade's review of it being IHop-esque) and a side. I got the twice baked potato only because I wanted the cook to work a little instead of paying for a baked potato which requires really no work at all.  My wife got the ranch house potatoes which could only be described as crazy hash browns.  No $12 a la carte sides items like 16 miles away from here!Somehow got coerced into getting dessert and was brought the biggest slice of chocolate cake I'd ever seen.  I enjoyed all 3 bites I had before shoving that into the third takeout box of the evening.Considering how ticked off my wife and I were for things not going as planned that evening, this was a very welcome surprise.  I am a big fan!  Not sure I would go out of my way to make it back here but this would certainly be on the top of my list when I am back around these parts.SO glad we had dinner here :)First it started with with my dinner salad. So tasty and fresh.I ordered the petite filet which was $27.99 (8 oz). I had them put some bleu cheese on top and it was so good. It came with cheesy bread and a twice baked potato. That potato is reason enough to go back!The meat is mesquite grilled. As you walk in and get seated by the hostess you walk right by the grill. The service was excellent.I saw on the menu they also offer take out service so if you want to just phone your order in and pick it up you can do that too. I think I will try that out with a salad and soup for lunch someday. They also host weddings and office, birthday, anniversary parties. They show all the Steelers games here too according the the server.OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...There are not many "old" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an "Old Western Vegas" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.Service: 4 starsKitch: 4 starsFood: 1 starI will never set foot in this place again! Worst service ever! Waited 25 minutes to even get noticed by the server. I was so excited that I was finally going to try this place out since I drive by it all the time and wanted a place that served some prime rib. Total disappointment when we were seated, no one approached my fiance and I. After seeing this family get service before us I was like "oh hell no, that did not just happen." I went to the hostess to tell her we've been sitting here for 20 minutes and no one has approached us, not even a drink order or anything. I wanted to walk out! She finally got the server but the server did not apologize for the wait or anything (this place wasn't even packed). She asked for our drink order and I told her we've been ready to order. I ordered the prime rib with the twice baked potato. It was okay!  Bob Taylor's Ranch House you totally disappointed me!If you like mesquite grilled steaks look no further. Bob Taylor's Ranch House is the place! My wife has been coming here for years and introduced me to the Ranch House. Now my Dad who recently retired and moved here frequents the Ranch House too. We made reservations for Christmas dinner and were really happy with our meal. I ordered the Ranch House Wings to start out with and I could smell the vinegar tickling my nostrils as it was brought to the table. Funny thing is they tasted nothing like vinegar and I liked that. They were meaty and tasted good. My dinner came with a choice of either soup or salad. The soup was Lobster Bisque and that wasn't going to work for me. My wife suggested that I just try the salad so I did. I ate every bite of my salad it was so damn good. Every piece of lettuce, which was crisp and not a pile of leaves or weeds, had dressing on it. When my Porterhouse arrived I was a happy boy. It was cooked just how I ordered it. The steak was juicy and tender. My twice baked potato was hot and good. For dessert I had a Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae. The brownie was so soft and hot. I liked everything about my meal and it was a great Christmas Dinner. There is also a lunch menu if you want to try a burger or other sandwiches. The French Dip is made with their smoked prime rib and is mouth watering.I'm always careful to keep my reviews in context, so let me first point out that even though I'm giving this place a full 5 stars, that should not be construed to mean it is better than the other finest steak houses near the strip.But...if you want to try a old (1955) rustic, homey (was literally a house at one point) place off the beaten path, with simply the finest selection of beef that is expertly prepared at about HALF the price of other places that feature similar beef...then you're going to love it.We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms that were most excellent.  The blue cheese dressing on our salads was home made and was simply excellent.  The garlic cheese bread was delicious.  THEN our meat arrived!  I had the 12oz Filet and my wife had the 16oz Prime Rib.  Both cuts were perfectly cooked on their large open grill and had a flavor and texture rarely experienced (and we go to a lot of nice steak houses...minimum 3/mo).  We finished up with a very good piece of Key Lime pie.I noted that a lot of other people were complaining about service...I guess we just got lucky.  Our waitress could not possibly have been more on top of things.So in summary...this place is not winning any awards for ambiance, but if you want a super fine piece of beef at half the price it would otherwise take, I highly recommend it.  We live in Green Valley about 45 minutes away, so I probably would not make the trip unless I was already out there for some other reason...but with meat that good, I'll probably find that reason.I don't think it can quite be categorized as a staple, but Bob Taylor's definitely has it's history in Las Vegas. Being born and raised here, I've been coming to the Ranch House for as far back as I remember. When I was younger, this was one my mom and stepdads favorite places to go for a steak. I remember when there used to be long waits and lines out the door. But I can't remember when exactly I was here last, I just know it's been a good 15+ years.A few of our friends recently invited us here for dinner when they were craving some "good ole' American meat". When the 5 of us walked in on a Saturday night, there was absolutely no wait. There was a few tables sat inside, and while the decor has remained mostly unchanged from what I remember, the place just doesn't seem to have that Ranch House feel anymore. It's definitely starting to show it's age, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it almost feels more like a chain restaurant now than a mini-getaway from the city like it used too.After browsing the menu for a bit, I decided on a special that there were advertising, a bacon-wrapped 8oz filet, I believe priced at about $35. Much like the regular menu items, it came with a soup or salad, and a potato choice. I chose the lobster bisque, which wasn't great, but according to other reviewers, was likely a lot better than their side salad. It just didn't really have much flavor, and there was no lobster in it. The best part about it was dipping their garlic cheese toast in it, which on it's own wasn't anything special either. Now, I'm the type of person who doesn't believe in eating a steak at anything past medium rare...and with no shame, I'll give you a hard time about doing so. But I think when I ordered my filet medium rare, and just about everyone else at the table ordered there's well done, it threw the kitchen off a little bit. All 4 of our steaks were just off a bit. Mine was cooked much closer to medium, and the well done orders were more like medium rare. Not that I feel too bad for them, since they won't be able to taste anything way, it's always disappointing when your steak isn't done right. Especially mine being over medium rare. Even though I still think the Ranch House uses fairly good quality meat, especially at the price, their execution just isn't there. Alongside the temperature issues, our steaks came with a béarnaise sauce that pretty much ruined the whole thing. It was easily the thickest béarnaise sauce I've ever seen, and had a texture that was more like a dry paste squeezed out of a pastry bag. There was no smoothness to it, it wasn't creamy, and it really didn't taste all that good. Scraping as much of it off as I could helped a bit, but this would have been an entirely different experience if that sauce wasn't there to begin with. There service doesn't have much behind it either. We felt really rushed with our orders, and it took a while to get drink refills too. Our waitress was okay, but she wasn't very friendly, and didn't seem all that interested in waiting tables anymore that night. Maybe nostalgia kicks in a little on this 3 star review, just because I like the place and have been here so many times before as a kid. And as I mentioned, I still don't think their prices are too crazy high for the quality of meat. But the service and kitchen execution resemble more of an Outback or other chain. I might go back eventually, but if it's anything like this last visit, and they've completely lost that homey, local feel with decent steaks to go along with it, the Ranch House would be all but a memory.Items Selected:Lobster BisqueGarlic Cheese BreadHalf-Smoked Chicken with Twice Baked Potato16oz NY Strip with Twice Baked Potato12oz Filet Mignon with Vegetables16oz Smoked Prime Rib with Ranch House PotatoesCarrot CakeWarm Brownie with Vanilla Ice CreamServing Las Vegans since 1955 and apparently a dirt road destination for locals before The Valley extended in all directions towards the burbs, Bob Taylor's Ranch House was chosen for an eveningtime meeting for friends discussing the current boom in local dining, the juxtaposition ironic in how unintentional it actually was when taking into account a setting that has not changed in decades.Located on the verge of Las Vegas and its neighboring city to the North and the sort of place where feral cats are free to roam on premises decorated with grass and a loose-gravel lot, it was just after 7 o'clock that our group of five was seated on the cusp of a dining room that reminisces of days long before most of us were born, the open kitchen to the left with a team of chefs searing a number of steaks, chickens, and chops.Predating the era of artisan purveyors, outlandish sourcing from overseas, and even meats served singularly with sides to be ordered a la carte, it was with conversation and cheap cocktails from the bar that the evening commenced, and soon to be served a basket of Wonderbread topped in cheese and garlic the presentation was actually better than one may have expected, a second basket later delivered free of charge and arguably one of the three best items to arrive on the table that night.No doubt a place more celebrated for its heritage than the items that appear on the plate, it was after an included low bowl of bisque flavored something like lobster that entrees arrived, each offered with a choice of a starch, both the creamy twice baked potatoes and bacon imbued Ranch House iteration competent with the former actually on-par with pricy versions on the Strip while the latter compared favorably to a good breakfast hash.Moving onward to the meats, suffice it to say that the two bites of New York Strip tasted were sinewy enough that fork was subsequently kept to myself and as much as the half smoked chicken may have seemed like a good option for those seeking something lighter, the actual execution was so dry that even dark meat saw one of my tablemates nearly choke when attempting to swallow without water, a veritable disaster of a dish with 2/3 left to waste.Told by a friend that Smoked Prime Rib was really the only thing to order at Bob Taylor's it was in a 16oz cut that $34.95 was sank and although certainly not much to look at both the flavor and texture were complex and ind indulgent, each bite seeing the tender flesh thoroughly permeated with perfume from mesquite that helped offset the heft of melting fat.A lot of food for the dollar, though not exactly a bargain unless one puts a monetary value on experiencing a "classic" in its almost original form, it was in a duo of desserts that remaining appetites were invested, the brownie and ice cream combination really no different than any diner classic while the huge wedge of carrot cake was enough to share around the table, the moist base chock-full of nuts and raisins with cream cheese frosting that came across tangy and only modestly sweet.**  Perhaps a poor choice for dinner the week after doing CUT and Carnevino on back-to-back nights it still warrants mention that the quality of Bob Taylor's Ranch House is really no better than any number of low-to-mid-range chains, the price too high to justify anything other than the smoked prime rib and perhaps a dessert no matter how historic the space.I was  looking for a good steak to try and I was referred to this place by two different people so  I decided to give it a try and take my girlfriend here for something a little different.  I was warned that this was out in the midle of residential homes and the tip was right.  The place has an old school vegas feel to it.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a lady that we presumed to be the owner...Super nice.  The decor is very old and there are photos of old vegas all around the place.  It was empty at first but the restaurant filled up pretty quickly.  The service started off awesome but as the restaurant began to fill up it slacked up a little.  For appetizers we had fried calamari which was the bomb and stuffed mushrooms.  The stuffed mushrooms were some of the best stuffed mushrooms I've had in awhile.  The house salad was not all that great to be honest.  I only had a few bites of it.  I should have gotten the potato soup but since I knew I was getting the twice cooked baked potato I didnt want to overdue it on potato.  I had heard that they had a 32 ounce porterhouse steak and I was dying to try it.  I also heard that if you finished it you get desert for free.  So I ordered the 32 ounce steak medium rare.  It came a little burned and rare in the middle which I could live with. Rare..medium rare....blah blah its all the same to me.  I loved the steak!  I finished it and got the deset for fee.  The carrot cake was some of the best I've ever had before.  Delicious.  If your looking for a new spot to try out and havent been here before I'd definetly try it out.  For me it's not some place I'd go to often because it's a journey out there for me and a little pricey if your paying for two.
Asadero Toro=Well, this is the real deal when you want a taco or tostada.  It's the EXACT food you will eat in Mexico.  Exact.  I ordered the asada.  Beef on a corn tortilla that is made there-- a real tortilla.  Then you go over to a salsa, quacamole, hot sauce, cucumber, cabbage and radish, onion bar and fix it up how you like.  The 5 stars is for the food, the ambiance and setting is not anything special.  In fact, it is a bit of a turn off , but very clean.  It's in an old Wendy's I think. The food is so delicious, it doesn't matter!!!!!!This place is legit. Don't expect much from the area or the neighborhood. But when you go in the staff is courteous and the place is clean. I was just driving wanting to try something new. I had passed this place several times. But what caught my eye was the painted sign on the window "Birria de Chivo" and Menudo served all week. Wow, most places only serve menudo on weekends. I pulled into the lot and decided to look them up in Yelp to see what if anything others had experienced. Looked good. I ordered 2 days worth of food. The torta de carne asada, and the birria de chivo (shreaded goat meat in a lightly seasoned broth) and a large horchata. She asked if I wanted the torta meal with beans and rice  or just the torta. I replied just the torta. She also provided me with a small sandwich style container for putting in veggies from the salsa bar and said if i needed another to just ask. I helped myself to the fresh sliced cucumbers, radishes, cabbage, wedges of key lime and pickled onions on the bar and filled a few small cups of salsa. The red was spicy with a vinegar base. The green was quite tasty as was the pico de gallo. The birria came with corn tortillas and small containers of fresh onion and cilantro. Again this was served as a caldo (sans veggies) but that is what you toss in the onions, cilantro, lime juice and some salsa. Yum! The torta was huge. Warning it doesn't come dressed. I was expecting the mayo, avocado, tomato to already be on this. But luckily I had picked up all the fixings at the salsa bar to make it work. And boy did it work. The pickled onions, cabbage, pico, avocado crema, salsa verde....Mmmm....
Capitol Chophouse=Capitol Chophouse is a great reminder of why I generally steer clear of restaurants built in hotels: They're never very good. I'm not certain whether it's because they rely on their built in audience (hotel guests) and don't try very hard, or if it's because there are people like me that expect it's going to be mediocre, but whatever the case, there's only one restaurant inside a hotel I rush to, Cleo inside The Redburry in LA. (Basset Street Brunch Club does a fine job in Madison, too.) I should preface this by saying that I ate here during Restaurant Week, and I feel terrible for saying this, but it's slowly becoming a way for consumers to figure out where NOT to eat during the year, as opposed to Madison Magazine's intended purpose, rousing the community with an array of amazing eats during a season when restaurant owners would love to see you spend some bucks. That said, several restaurants in town do the week up right, Capitol Chophouse isn't on that list. Our server Lee was a knockout, with his incredible knowledge of the menu and some decent wine pairing advice. He was attentive and great for some banter at the table, and if I didn't eat anything, I'd give the place 5 stars simply for Lee. But I did eat, and it wasn't good. And it was expensive. And I don't know why. None of the desserts grabbed me, so I decided not to go with the Restaurant Week menu and ordered a mixed green salad with mustard vinaigrette and the scallops. The amount of salad that arrived was almost comical. I can't tell you what I ate because I was overwhelmed by spinach. The dressing was sparse and lacked flavor and after about ten bites, I gave up. It wasn't interesting. The scallops were also a flop. Seared only on top (which made for a nice presentation, but how do you not sear a scallop on two sides?) I've picked up better scallops at the co-op, and cheaper too! At $32, the dish is restaurant robbery. Some might say I should have stuck with the menu they were offering, but the scallops were a part of that, so I'm unclear how making a larger portion of something they were used to churning out all week as part of their Restaurant Week menu turned out so poor.Although the sides we ordered (asparagus and brussels sprouts) were tasty, my two dining companions didn't think too highly of their meals either, both of them trying steak. The two bottles of wine we split were fine, but with the crazy mark-up, I would have rather we saved some cash and imbibed somewhere after. That was a very expensive $100+ endeavor that I won't be repeating.
Phat Burrito=It truly breaks my heart to write this review. I am squirming in my seat as I speak, or type I guess. I really really really want to love Phat Burrito, I mean, really. It just isn't the same anymore and I can't hold on any longer. I love the location, I love the decor, I love the murals, or "pieces" in urban terms, and the overall charm that emits from this place. The restaurant is super cool, hip, eclectic and is a spot where regulars don't need a menu (if you can find it). Phat Burrito brings me back to the days of b-boying and ya know, my ghetto youth. It's just, what's all that charm without good food? I'm not all superficial. I appreciate a little substance and I've given Phat Burrito enough chances to love me back. Each visit just seems to get worse, and today's lunch was a kick in the nuts. Now, the fish taco was good; grouper, charbroiled on an optional CORN tortilla (yay) and topped with a mango salsa. Yep pretty yumm. Tortillas are grilled rather than steamed, which I adore. The burrito though was another utter disappointment. The beans were al dente - hard. Rice was bland and soggy, thus making my burrito wet and causing it to crack in half. The chicken was bland and dry. Every other bite was hard with a few burnt pieces. While the portions are nice, the burrito as a whole was just lacking something; flavor. Mediocre IMO. I've practically tried everything on the menu (not hard to do), but my heart belongs to chicken. But when the chicken continually does you wrong, whats a fellow to do now but move on to the next one.
Marigold Kitchen=This is perplexing! How have I yet to write a review for Marigold?Doesn't matter if it's breakfast, brunch or lunch I always enjoy my time at MK. To be honest (look out) it's my favorite in the Sardine/Gates&Brovi/Marigold food empire. Staff is so darn pleasant, they have an efficient way of keeping people moving, and their specials are always mouthwatering interesting. During Chanukah this past year they were frying up latkes that were bomb! On their normal menu I love the scrambler with sausage and you can't go wrong with the french toast. Holy cow it's good. I want to continue to work my way through the menu because I have some stand-bys that I continue to go back for time and time again. They're just so good!One of the best brunches in Madison can be had at Marigold Kitchen.For you Chicagoans, this place is remarkably similar to Birchwood Kitchen--from the setup (placing your order at the register and then having staff deliver your food), to the menu, which features classics as well as eclectic items. And everything is homemade, right down to the mayonnaise used in their sandwiches.Marigold is a busy place, serving breakfast, brunch, and lunch, but they manage to keep everything moving smoothly. It seems to be a very well-oiled machine.We went for brunch, and the menu had so many great choices that I kept changing my mind; should it be the artichoke, oven-roasted tomato and asiago cheese omelette, the duck confit hash, the French toast with berry puree, or the "scrambler"? Man, I tell you, everything sounded mouthwatering. And what's this? $5 breakfast cocktails made with fresh-squeezed juices? Now I had to decide between a mimosa, greyhound, screwdriver, or bloody mary. Life is hard.I went with the "scrambler," an egg dish mixed with sautéed cremini mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes, and pesto cream cheese. It was fanfreakingtastic on its own, but then it comes with Marigold potatoes and French rosemary toast. I did think the potatoes were a tad greasy, but overall they were delicious. But what's up with places that are too scared to toast bread so that it has some actual color? I want toast, not hard bread that makes me feel like I'm eating something stale instead of toasted. Don't be afraid to get some brown on that bitch!My trusty dining companion enjoyed an omelette with zucchini, roasted red peppers, goat cheese, and parmesan. I was able to sneak a bite and can report that it too, was a solid choice.We sat on the patio as we drank our perfectly spicy bloody marys and iced lattes and watched the people and pups stroll by. What a great place. I'm jealous of people that live in Madison.I am so coming back here. After all, I haven't even tackled the lunch menu. I spied a turkey and artichoke grilled cheese, warm spiced squash salad and a chutney chicken salad sandwich. And that was just the first page of the menu. Let the indecision begin....GET OUT OF THE HOTELThere is one thing I can't stand and it is eating in a hotel run restaurant. Many business travelers eat at a hotel out of convenience. It's close to your room and toothbrush. I like to go outside the box. I can't stand the powdered eggs, lumpy oatmeal, tasteless pancakes, greasy bacon and burnt toast. I need something fresh to start my day. A few years ago I came across this place and they open at 7am. I love getting out of my hotel room and grabbing a table outside here. Luckily the weather has been pleasant on the times I have visited here.  I imagine dinning outside in February would be brutal plus the coffee would freeze. This place is also located down the street from the Wisconsin Capital. There website claims you can hit it with one of there muffins because its so close. Is that a challenge? Plus will you bail me out of jail? I'll wait for a message from you before ever trying that. Ha! (On a side note...Dear Gov Walker I would never do that...I was just adding humor to my Yelp Review)I've tried a few things on the menu, over the years. I do love grabbing a fresh brewed coffee and/or a fresh squeezed OJ. I've also tried the breakfast egg sandwich and the omelette with ham & gruyere cheese on several different occasions. Both breakfast items were delicious. Also the eggs they use are farm fresh and organic. You can really taste the freshness plus its good for you.  I have never tried the lunch menu because I'm usually stuck working but the breakfast is good here. It is places like this that make my travels fun. It is always exciting to find a delicious new fresh place to eat on the road. The sad part is leaving Madison, after my work is done and then heading home. I never know if I will ever come back and visit, until work sends me this way...the good thing is that Madison is not too far from Chicago, so I can always take a road trip. If you're in your Madison hotel room reading this at breakfast or lunch (they close at 3pm on weekdays and 2pm on weekends), then it's time to sneak by the crappy breakfast lobby bar and get some real fresh food. The walk over will be pleasant and the capital building is a beautiful building to look at too. Once you arrive, then grab a nice table and start your morning out right.Madison Magazine got me again!  After a spread on the 13 best pancakes in Madison I had no choice but to accept the mission before me.  Our first stop?  Marigold Kitchen!  I have had this place bookmarked for a while and was happy to finally get the chance to visit it.  There was tons of parking and the location was easy to find, well after the GPS got involved. Upon entering the restaurant I noticed that there was what they called 'seating etiquette' which basically said, order with the cashier  then you'll be guided to your seat.  Though this place was jam packed we were able to order right away and did not have to wait to find a seat.  I ordered the blueberry and apricot pancake with bacon as that was the item featured.  Well let me tell you, this place sure did not disappoint.The pancakes do not look like much just 3 smallish/medium pancakes with a few blueberries on top and a slice of almond butter. Man!  Those pancakes were pretty incredible!  They were really light and just freaking good.  I also ordered the bacon which was good as well, not as standout as the pancake but still good.I am really looking forward to coming back to this place.  The layout is a bit crammed but in a really cute way.  They also have an awesome menu, I already know what I'm going to try when I go back.  If you haven't been to this place, do yourself a favor and go!  You won't be disappointed.Madison no doubt has some of the best egg sandwiches out there. I'd only ever had McDonald's egg mcmuffin (a zillion years ago, mind you), so perhaps my expectations weren't all that high. But my oh my, Marigold Kitchen's egg sandwich is one of the best I've had since moving to Madison a year ago. Would of gotten five stars had the bacon been cooked a little longer.For a side I purchased potatoes, which I generally would douse in ketchup - but there was enough flavor where, dare I say it, my favorite condiment was not necessary. Tried the Peppermint Mocha with Soy. Not a fan. Boyfriend enjoyed the coffee, but wished there was more of a selection rather than just one Regular or Decaf carafe. The unlimited refills made up for his griping, though.I think the thing that stands out for me from Marigold is the service. Yes, the have absolutely delicious food and the coffee is great. The atmosphere is cozy-casual, but man, the service made the experience for me.I have an aversion to onions. I don't have an allergy, but I do not like them in any form, not raw, not caramelized, not pickled, no way, no how do I eat onions. And at Marigold I want to order the breakfast sandwich which comes with a fried egg, cheddar-spiked boursin, applewood smoked bacon, tomato and green onion on toasted ciabatta. I asked for no green onions. While they aren't on my strict no-onions list I still choose not to have them when possible. However, they were mixed in with the cheddar-spiked boursin and therefore not removable. I hemmed and hawed but the man at the counter said it would be good and if it wasn't he would give me something else so I took it.I ended up eating about half of it, not because I didn't like it, but just because I was full. However, the man from the counter came over toward the end of our breakfast and expressed concern about the amount of the sandwich I hadn't eaten. He tried to get me to order something else and apologized if I didn't enjoy my breakfast. I did, in fact, enjoy my breakfast. But, man. The fact that he remembered me and checked in based on how much I ate was really nice. And so, I'd go back for the service if nothing else. But, in reality I'd also go back to try the pancakes because those looked fantastic.THIS JUST IN: You can get a short stack! WHAAAAAAAA? I'm constantly overwhelmed by the sweet their pancakes punch, but get this, you can get a wee stack of two for a few buck when typically the larger portion runs $10. SOLD! Does it say this on the menu somewhere? It's possible. But you're reading Yelp, and now you know, so you don't need to eye over the menu closely. Simply peep the chalkboard, decide that the special pancakes are the best being offered, then grab a short stack!
Silvercreek=The food was good, but it doesn't outweigh the management practices. The experience was bordering on a nightmare. Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked. When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our "reservation" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had "little parcels" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars. I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people.Yelp steered us here for brunch, but your only option is a buffet.  And it's not good.My waffle was okay, but the syrup dish had a lot of "skin" that had developed in the tray.  Kinda chunky when pouring it out.The bacon and sausage weren't particularly flavorful.  The "homemade" biscuits were hard.Of all the places we ate in Champaign, this was the worst.  Definitely not worth $20+ for the same kind of Sterno-warmed slop you'd find at Old Country Buffet.Go get a cup of Jarling's Custard and make that your brunch.
Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon=I have had good and bad times here. Good times out weigh the bad for sure. Today I used a $15.00 coupon that they sent me for my b-day. I had an 11 oz sirloin med rare wedge salad with blue cheese and chicken tortilla soup. They also serve peanuts and bread before the meal arrives. All the food was excellent, cooked as ordered and perfect flavor. The staff was good, a little slow but the bartender had a large togo order she was finishing up. Another waiter helped her by taking the order. GREAT MEAL especially since it was free. LOL
Hemingway's Cafe=As a student in Pittsburgh, it seems that Hemingway's is a rite of passage.  To mark the end of my first semester of graduate school, my friend and I came here for some lunch time day drinking after an 8 AM final.  There were quite a few other students in there, mostly undergrads with a head start.  It was not terribly crowded but very loud.Hemingway's has MULTIPLE happy hours.  Yes.  Lunch time from 11 AM to 12 PM happens to be a happy hour with half priced sandwiches!  What?!?!  Instantly impressed.Here are some food thoughts:Jolly Rancher Shot Pitcher ($7)- This had a quite a few shots within it, and I split it with my friend.  It was green apple flavored, but honestly, it was mostly sugar and not much alcohol.  I couldn't even feel the alcohol afterwards.  But the gummy worms in the pitcher were awesome.Buffalo Chicken Wrap (Normally $8.99, $4.50 at happy hour)- The wrap was delicious.  Not too spicy, just right!  Probably one of the best versions of this wrap I've ever had.  I made the mistake, though, of opting for coleslaw over the french fries.  Bad decision.  Get the french fries!!!  They are seasoned and perfection!!!  Massive case of buyer's remorse.  The coleslaw was pretty boring.  Get the french fries.  Trust me.My friend ordered a burger, and it was massive.  At the same price as my wrap, I was totally jealous.  The burger looked and smelled amazing, and I plan to get one when I come back.Service isn't particularly fast, but most people are there to just hang out, so it is cool.  The service was very friendly and good, though.The only odd thing is that if you do NOT order a drink, there is a $1 up-charge.
Osaka Japanese Bistro=It's late on a Sunday night and the BF suggests trying out the original Osaka after having visited their second location a few weeks back. Walking through the front door, you immediately face a wall.  Not the most feng shui I'm sure, but make a right down the hall and you'll see another entrance which brings you right to the sushi bar.  I noted to the BF that this location was way smaller, and he then pointed out they had more room in the back.  We took a walk down there after eating to check out their tatami room (lots of space), semi-private booths, and a hibachi grill area too.  They are pretty fancy here with slide shows running on a computer screen at every booth in the back.  I would be even more impressed if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by pressing your selection.  That would be super high tech!  Anyway, back to the review and the food.  The menus are pretty much the same at both locations, for the most part.  From their late night happy hour menu, this is what we ordered:* Shishamo ($2.80) - It came with three pieces.  Again a bit tougher than what I'm used to.  They seasoned it with black pepper, but I asked for some salt to give it a little more kick too.* Korean-Style Spicy Chicken ($4.50) - It's literally stir-fried chicken with Korean spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce.  I wasn't sure if the lettuce was garnish or to eat.  Oh well, I ate it.* Crazy Horse Roll ($4.20) - It's tuna, salmon, masago and mixed together with spicy sauce.  It's a very basic roll, but pretty good.* Fire Roll ($3.90) - Crab meat and spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it looks like the CA rolls you buy from the supermarket, but without the avocado in it.  It had a bit of kick in it.And from their regular menu: * Ankimo ($6.95) - Monkfish liver...oh how I love this stuff.  It's an acquired taste.  I like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauce and then break off a tiny piece and savor each little morsel.  The BF likes to dunk his piece into the sauce and then toss the whole thing in his mouth.  He likes to then mush it around in his mouth.  Haha!They are known for their exotic and colorful rolls, and they can be a bit a pricey.  It's our unfortunate luck that the only two rolls we ordered were so visually boring.  Service: It wasn't too busy this late in the evening.  A handful of people at the bar and few people at the tables.  The BF had to ask for his soda to be refilled and the waitress never came back with his drink!  When he asked for it, the waitress got him another one.  Then a few minutes later, she came by and took his drink away!  (We were wondering why she did that.)  When she came back with his drink, she said she was refilling it again.  (I guess to make up for his drink disappearing in the first place.)  The BF asked for my own pot of tea since I'm a big tea drinker and to save them the trouble of having to refill my teacup every five seconds.One waiter came by twice to take away dishes that we weren't done yet.  In the process, he would try to squeeze in between us to reach for the plate, only to realize there was still food on it.  And finally at the end of our meal when the plate was clearly empty, then he asked if he could take it!  We were amused.  And actually, when we are both done sharing a plate, we actually put it to the side to help them out for that reason - so they don't have to reach in between a couple of lovebirds.  Duh!     Don't forget that you can get a 10% coupon when you visit their website!(Yep, there's pics of our food eats in the business profile!)I stopped writing reviews on Yelp because it was too time consuming, but after eating at this restaurant, I can't help but tell the world about our experience, one that I hope will make other people wary of coming here.We arrived at Osaka on a typical Saturday afternoon (1pm-ish) and was shown a table in the back room (where the tables were larger).  As we walked past the first room upon entering, I noticed that it was fairly empty but it didn't struck me as odd since there are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.We sat down and were given multiple menus, each one with something different in it.  I guess this could be a good thing since I like having lots of choices.  We ordered our drinks (hot green tea and iced green tea) and browsed the menus for omakase, which we heard from someone (ahem) that it is worth coming here for.After everyone in our party arrived (there were 5 of us), we asked the waitress about their omakase and she completely hesitated. I thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question.  She said she'll be right back, so we sat there, thinking maybe she's just new or something.  But even so... o_O.She came back and in broken English asked us if we wanted sashimi or sushi, and we said a little of both.  She then proceeded to say that it's $100 for all four people that wanted it, and I confirmed if it was $100 per person, or if it was $100 for all four people because that makes a HUGE difference.  She said $100 for four people, so we agreed.After ordering the "omakase" - I realized that she must have ordered us the plate of normal sashimi/sushi that was on the menu.  I remember seeing $50 for 2 people for something, so with 4 people, she just doubled it.  I thought sure... why not.  We were going to try their assortment of rolls, but given that the omakase is supposed to be good, I decided to give it a try.The first plate of sashimi came out looking decent.  I'm not too familiar with the names and the translation for the type of fish, so I'm just going to say that I tried just about everything on the menu and only a couple items tasted okay.  There were quite a few nasty bites in between, including one in which I had to spit out.  Now, I'm not a sushi snob at all, but when I have to do that, it means it's NOT good.  My companions agreed, and another person had to go thru that ritual later on in the meal as well (said one of the fish tasted grainy too).  Fortunately, our napkins were right in front of us.  =)As an additional note, we received 2 additional plates of sushi rolls which were supposed to be part of the omakase deal.  We thought it was just so-so as well... perhaps even bad.At the end of the meal, we noticed the $100 + $70 on top of our other charges.  We asked about the $70 and they said it was for the 2 plates of sushi rolls that accompanied our sashimi omakase plate. Needless to say, that $70 was a surprise because we were told  it was $100 for four people.  If they told us they were going to bring additional sushi plates for $35 each, I think we would've either said no, or ordered or own rolls.  Ugh.  I hate when mess-ups like this happen.We told our waitress about the issue and she left to talk to the owner/mgr.  The owner/mgr. came by quite awhile later to ask us what the issue was.  We explained clearly about the unexpected charge and the miscommunication but he wouldn't budge.  In fact, he brought up how good of a quality the fish were, and given that, this is still a good deal.  The whole time, I kept thinking if I should tell the truth about the quality of his fish, but I kept my mouth shut in case he was going to give us a break.I suppose we all could've said something because at the end, nothing happened out of the negotiation.  He wouldn't even take the charge of one $35 plate of sushi off, so we paid, left, and vowed never to come back.  I've had a lot of sushi before, but I would rank this as the worst sushi AND experience ever.  There are a ton of other great sushi restaurants in Vegas, so look it up on Yelp and go there.  You will not regret it.Since Raku was closed for the first couple days of the New Year, we had to search for another new place to eat.We found Osaka Japanese Bistro.First of all, there's some history to this place.  It's been around for over 40 years so you have to assume they know what they're doing.  It's also in a slightly shady part of town where only locals should go or those who are lost searching for Ichiza find themselves.We started off with some sushi rolls and sashimi.  Meh.  I've had fresher sashimi and better tasting roll combinations.  Although, I did like the fact Osaka offered half orders on most of their rolls.The entree we ordered was a little better.  We ordered the John's Special and had a good time to sharing.  Tempura was battered a little heavier than I'm use to but the chicken and beef teriyaki had a good flavor.The dessert was surprisingly good.  We had the green tea tiramisu (I know it's a traditional Italian dessert but doesn't it just sound Japanese?).  I would have never have guessed that the flavors of mascarpone and green tea would marry so well.  It was pricey but worth the experience.Overall, I'd be willing to go back for late night eats, desserts, and drinks but will have to pass on having dinner here again.My cousin loves this place. We were actually seated at Steak N Shake and we had this epiphany that we should go get sushi instead. So we got up and drove all the way up the I-15 to Osaka.When you enter, you're greeted by a blank wall. What is this - a Japanese Speakeasy? You then turn right and go through another door that takes you to a small sushi bar area. From this initial view, you'd think the place was tiny. If you continue to the back and left, though, you discover that the place can seat quite a lot of people. They have a Teppanyaki area and a surprising number of private booths and traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables. The space is very aesthetically pleasing.Unfortunately, when it came to the food, I was disappointed. I really wasn't that hungry, but I tried everything that my cousin ordered. We stuck to their late night special menu that is available 10pm-2am.* Beef Tataki Salad - It looked amazing, but it lacked flavor. I think I've only ever had Beef Tataki at Ichiza and theirs runs circles around Osaka's.* King Crab Tempura - This was easily the best thing we ordered. Delicious.* Salmon Skin (half) Roll - This also lacked flavor. I'm kind of a purist in that I like to eat sushi exactly how the chef made it. I never use soy sauce or add wasabi. I stuck to my guns on this, despite the roll really needing the extra flavor.* Screaming Orgasm (ahi sashimi on top of some salad) - This also looked amazing. It had better flavor than the Beef Tataki, but I wasn't blown away by it. The dressing was a little too vinegary.On the plus side, the service was excellent. The two ladies that served us were extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. The green tea tasted great and was the perfect thing on my still recovering throat. Whenever I was running low on tea, the lady would come back and top it off promptly.I really hate giving less than three stars, but I must stay true to the rating system. Indeed, I have experienced better. It's too bad because the service and decor of Osaka are top notch.
Greenbush Bar=This used to be my go-to place anytime I was meeting friends for a casual dinner.  The pizza is very good with an excellent selection of toppings.  However, I will never, repeat never, step foot in this establishment again and here is my story ...  BAD SERVICE AND RUDE MANAGEMENT.I was meeting two girlfriends there.  When I got there, the manager advised she would not seat me until my entire party arrived, which was kind of rude, but understandable.  They fill up fast and the seating is very limited.  When we all arrived we were seated.  The first interaction we had with our waitress came was a snide comment from her, "I thought there were going to be four of you," implying we had no right to be seated if our entire party was not there.When the waitress took our drink order my friend ordered a lemonade.  This waitress pipes up "The lemonade is homemade and is very tart.  Do you still want it?"  she says, with a sigh of impatience.  My friend says yes.  The waitress comes back about 3 minutes later explaining that they are out of lemonade, would she like something else.  My friend explained that she could not drink anything with carbonation and did the waitress have another suggestion.  She did not and my friend stuck with water.  After our food arrived, my friend then asks if they have ice tea as an option.  The waitress with the same amount of snideness says "I think so.  We brew it fresh and it sometimes run out.  Also, it is very minty.  Do you still want it?"  My friend says yes.  And now I'm starting to wonder what is with our waitress.  Every time we ask for something she acts like we are inconveniencing her and why didn't she recommend the ice tea when my friend asked her for non-carbonated drink options?Twenty minutes later our appetizers of garlic cheese bread came and it was good.  Another 15 minutes after that our pizza came ... completely wrong.  I had ordered a "16" pizza with all mushrooms, all black olives, half sausage and half pepperoni."  The pizza came out with all the meat on one half, which is not what I ordered.  I indicated to the waitress that this was wrong and she then proceeded to flip back through her order pad and with another heavy sigh started reading my order back.  I stopped her and told her that I knew what I ordered and this wasn't it.  She offered to have the kitchen make another pizza but "it would be awhile as there are other pizzas ahead of this."  I could just feel her begging us to just deal with it and not make her go back for a new pizza.  One of my friends had been visiting a friend in the hospital and was going to return to her as soon as were done with dinner so we didn't want to wait for a new pizza and just tried to pick around the stuff.  As it turns out, only 1/2 the pizza got eaten as it was just too difficult to deal with.  We never saw our waitress again.  Another 20 minutes pass and then the manager sneaks the bill onto our table and walks away.  I stopped her to explain that our pizza was wrong and I felt it would be a nice gesture for them to give us a reduction on our bill.  The manager stopped me abruptly and indicated that she had heard about the mix-up and felt that "her experienced waitress could not have been wrong."  What??!! Excuse me?  I then told her our side of the story, which she was clearly not interested in hearing and then stated that "sometimes we do offer a discount, but would not in this case."  When I explained I was not some street person trying to get a free meal, just a discount to show their concession, she didn't care and walked away.  If I am going out to dinner to pay five times what it would cost me to make the same meal at home, I expect that some of that money is for customer service and the luxury of being waited upon.  I couldn't believe this complete disregard for their customers.  They didn't seem to care if I would ever return.  Well, now they have not only lost an existing customer, but I will do everything in my power to ensure that I have some impact on whether they get any new customers.  I guess the only way to make my voice heard is by writing about it here.  I felt sick to my stomach when I left there, as if I had actually been robbed at gunpoint.  For a place that relies solely on repeat customers and word of mouth, they have a very high and mighty attitude.  Please avoid the Greenbush at all costs.  If you want a unique and casual pizza place with creative pizza and italian food, visit Villa Dolce in Middleton.  You will have an excellent dining experience without the attitude and parking hassles.Just left the GreenBushBar in Madison. Our group of 7POC + 1 waited a half hour for a table, then a group who came in after us got seated first.The manager, when confronted, said she decided we'd be more comfortable near the a/c and that's why she gave our table away. She didn't ask us, she didn't stop and inform us, we only were aware when she was asked about the table that had been given away.I did not see any POC in there during this entire duration. As we were leaving the manager came out and was like "oh we have a lovely table for you" but it was pretty fucking too late for that bullshit so we went to Qdoba instead.So you might not want to patronize this place if you're in town for Wiscon or ever.
Bangkok Balcony=Good place in Squirrel Hill for delicious Thai food and a fun atmosphere. The dining room overlooks the road as it is on the second floor of the building. Reservations are accepted but it wasn't busy when we stopped on a Sunday night. Staff was very professional and polite. They had Thai dancers performing in the dining room which created a fun atmosphere but it was still intimate and not distracting to those having a quiet meal. The portions were large and I had plenty f leftovers to take home. The shrimp and tofu red curry was perfectly spices for me at a 4 on a scale of 3-10. Red curry is my favorite and I always order it anytime I eat Thai food. While I thought it was good here, I do prefer it elsewhere where I have had it with more vegetables and pineapple which I find to be a perfect contrast to the spice. I would probably not get this again if I return. I also had the fresh spring rolls as an appetizer which had a nice presentation, but I found to be slightly dry. Overall, I probably will go elsewhere if I find myself craving Thai cuisine, but if I am in the area, I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again.
Bob Evans=***Bob Evans is in the style and price range of Denny's and IHOP though Bob Evans serves a better breakfast than those two restaurant chains; some of the food on this visit was not at the optimal temperature though***Bob Evans is a very popular family restaurant in the Midwest (they also have several locations in the South like this one in a rural part of Charlotte).  Bob Evans is like a countrified Denny's or IHOP.  Bob Evans is most popular for breakfast, which is available all day.  Their signature breakfast item is their sausage gravy and biscuits.  Their sausage gravy is creamy and filled with sausage.  It is surprisingly spicy--at least when compared to the many gravy and biscuits places out there serving bland white milk gravy with biscuits. The sausage gravy at this location definitely delivered the flavor of this popular item at Bob Evans; unfortunately, the sausage gravy could have been a little hotter.  The buttermilk biscuits were similar in quality to what you would get at other Bob Evans locations.  Bob Evans' biscuits have a crunchy top, but they tend to be a tad on the dry side; the sausage gravy helps though. I also had their scrambled eggs, which were fine, and their crispy shredded hash browns that were topped with cheese, scallions and bacon.  Their sausage links were good and better than what you get at most chain restaurants or with hotel breakfasts.  While I liked the sausages here, I enjoyed them more when Bob Evans was a smaller chain. The French toast was below average.  It was not as sweet as it should have been and had a dense, undesirable center. Service was extremely friendly and fitting with the service you get at most Bob Evans locations. Prices were very reasonable.  There were several low-cost options and their bigger breakfast combinations were not too expensive and featured generous portions. The dining room here was simple but comfortable.  This Bob Evans also has a counter where you can buy packaged treats/items and Bob Evans syrups, pancake mix and such. This Bob Evans is an okay breakfast spot in the rural area outside of Downtown Charlotte.  If you head to Downtown Charlotte though, I am sure that you will find much better, more creative and more local breakfast spots. This Bob Evans has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.It's been awhile since I was here and had hopes it would get better.  Service was always their week point and I'm sorry to say, it has not gotten any better.Granted it appears they have done some remodeling in the front which does give a nice open clean atmosphere on entering, it stops there.We stopped for lunch today after shopping at Northlake Mall.  The host was not sure of his seating chart and had to physically go and confirm so there was more than a fair measure of confusion here.  He seated us in a booth but apparently no one told our server who did not appear for over 5 minutes going on 10.She was not very friendly but everyone has an off day.  My wife ordered iced tea and I ordered coffee.  Can't comment on her tea and while Bob Evans Coffee is normally very good and they sell it at the counter, my coffee was extreamely weak and had nothing bold about it.My wife ordered a bowl of their potato soup and a large salad while I had the open faced turkey with dressing, mashed potatoes, cranberries and gravy.  I expected a open faced turkey sandwich with dressing, mashed potatoes on the side along with the cranberries.  Everything except the cranberries were piled on top of each other and as far as the cranberries, never did see them anywhere.I had my tablet while I was there so I could check the news but should have gone back to the car to get my hotspot.  While their WiFi which the advertize at the door, showed a strong signal, it kept dropping several times a minute.  Finally gave up and went back to the smartphone.All in all, would not recommend to anyone.  Poor service, indiferrent and uninvolved management and less than stellar cusine does not make for a sucessful restaurant.
Madison Sourdough=The chocolate brownie at Madison Sourdough could end world war.(I'm certain of it.)Forget about awkward insides like nuts or chips that just get in the way and slow you down, and ditch the dusting of powdered sugar or even worse fudge, (stop putting fudge on brownies America) and what you're left with is a brownie in its purest form. Rectangle shaped chocolate. That is all. I'm not certain what chocolate they use, but it's rich and it's creamy, and the texture of the brownie itself has a certain moistness that's beyond description. And I don't even like the word moist! But it's the only word in my lexicon to describe just how sink-your-teeth-in-drool-worthy these things are. And on one hand it's hard for me to overlook the delicious pasty that blankets the two glass cases at Madison Sourdough, but on the other hand the brownie stands out as the best option to cure my craving each and every time. It's like a cacao beacon begging me to eat it. I've also had breakfast and lunch, sipped some strong brew and on a rare occasion got a cookie (a cookie!) and while tasty nothing tops what is possibly the best brownie I've ever eaten. (And I'm a brownie connoisseur. I grew up in a home where brownies were as popular as Real Housewives spin offs. 5 or so home-baked varieties stocked our freezer and wound up in school lunches. So I know.) In conclusion.... get a brownie. It's the secret to world peace.My husband and I were in the area looking for a fantastic food choice, Yelp and my husband's hankering for a latte beckoned us here.  We chose to eat off the lunch side (breakfast until 3 PM too) with orders of the Pork and Apple sandwich and Chicken Pannini.  Both came with a side salad tossed with a light vinaigrette.   The sandwiches were tasty and the bread was fantastic.  The pork was on baguette and the chicken was a hearty sourdough.  My husband isn't into tough breads so it was tender and still crunchy.  I have to admit, I thought the pork was going to be acceptable but it had beautiful flavors which gave a sweet savory.  I will be back but to try the bakers breakfast or french toast.The City of Madison continues to impress me with its food offerings; most recently, Madison Sourdough was added to my ever-expanding list of places to go while in this terrific town.Whether you're looking for a pastry, full-on breakfast, lunch, just a cup of coffee, or a crusty sourdough baguette to bring home, MS on Willy Street has you covered, and everything hits the sweet spot in your stomach.We visited recently and had a delicious breakfast, and what a bonus that it happened to be a beautiful morning to sit outside on their patio. It felt like we were in Europe, mostly because of the adorable pooches lying obediently under the tables while their owners were enjoying their breakfast.Started out with perfect cafe mochas. I am very picky about this drink--it has to have just the right ratio of espresso/chocolate/milk, and it's very easy for one to overpower the other, but theirs was spot-on.The breakfast sandwich I had was a thing of beauty, and filled me up right up until dinner. Eggs (anyway you like 'em, I chose fried), cheddar cheese, and aioli, all served on a toasted croissant. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to add their house-smoked ham. It was so satisfying, and every component was delicious. Served with some lovely mixed greens on the side.Other breakfast items range from the traditional (eggs benedict, omelets, biscuits and gravy ) to the less conventional (huevos rancheros, sourdough french toast, potato hash with duck fat and farro), as well as a daily quiche and strata offering. You can't go wrong, and whether you're trying to be healthy or gluttonous, it's all outstanding.Lunch is similarly diverse: opt for a cubano, veggie pesto sandwich, grilled cheese, chicken salad or braised beef cheeks.On Wednesday mornings they do something called "Coffee with Cops," which is a great way to engage the community and give and receive information in an informal setting.Service is uber friendly. It goes without saying that their bread is fantastic, and it's served at many restaurants in Madison.I just love this place and plan to visit as much as I can when in Madison.I spent a couple of hours at Madison Sourdough and it was enjoyable from top to bottom. Corey D and I started with breakfast. I had a decaf latte and I know, I know. What's the point of coffee without caffeine? Being pregnant means I can't have too much caffeine, but I still really enjoy the smell and taste of coffee, hence the decaf version. And sometimes decaf tastes terrible, like the coffee gods are punishing you for having poor taste. But, this one was quite nice.For food I ordered a selection of sides - a build-your-own-breakfast if you will. I had two eggs, a giant side of fruit, and a warm biscuit served with house made preserves. I enjoyed every bite.After breakfast we spent some time working, aka Internetting, and the connection was always reliable and the atmosphere calm and friendly. I would easily recommend this spot for breakfast, a bit of work, meeting up with friends, or baked goods!
State Street Brats=Congratulations, State Street Brats: you nailed it! And by "it" I mean being just awful. Last night some friends and I went to Brats after not being able to acquire hockey tickets. We wanted a semi-ridiculous, sports-centric atmosphere, so Brats seemed like the logical choice. We'd all been in college, and thought we knew what to expect. Nope.After grabbing a booth upstairs and sitting around for awhile, a waitress came by and asked if we were interested in ordering. After telling her yes, she told us that they were cutting their wait staff so we had to go to the bar to order. Not a huge deal, but there were some flaws:1) the wait staff that was supposedly cut were aimlessly wandering around the bar for the entire time we were there2) when you ordered, they told you to just come back and check if your food was ready - no estimate of time, no notification system, and again, no use of their employees milling about3) after our table had ordered and checked for food a few times, the table behind us got waiter serviceThanks for your outstanding customer service, guys!To top it off, the food was as lacking as the service. The nachos were basically a pile of oil, the cheese curds eerily resembled bad breaded chicken used at fast food Chinese restaurants, and the burger baskets were a ripoff. While the burger was okay, the $2 upcharge for fries was a joke. For $2.50 you can get an entire basket of fries, but the two bucks they charge to add them to your burger only gets you about fifteen soggy fries. While the portion size was okay (I ate about two before deciding they were too gross to continue on with), it's nonsense that they charge you so much for a tenth of what comes in a basket that you could just order separately for virtually the same price. At the very least, I learned a very important lesson: State Street Brats is best enjoyed by highly intoxicated college students and my time there is over.
Porta Bella=Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a food snob, but I do enjoy cooking and when I eat out, I like to order food that offers me something that I can not easily create myself.  We are new to Madison, and just the week before we ate at Tutto's down the street from Portabella's for the first time.  Tuttos is almost exactly the same price-point and we had good food, a great atmosphere, and a wonderful time.When I took my wife's family to Portabella's for her birthday, I was expecting something special.  The restaurant had equally good reviews for food and absolutely rave reviews for atmosphere.  When we arrived, we were promptly ushered into that room that is typically set aside for families with children (or the under-dressed).  No problems there, a little tacky, but the service was still attentive and we didn't want to ruin anyone else's romance.In short, we were still prepared to be impressed.  We were very surprised to discover that the food was absolutely lousy.  Not just bad, cheap catered wedding banquet bad. To give you an idea of what I mean, the chicken breast in the chicken rollatini was not properly dressed and still had bits of gristle attached.  It also had that peculiarly soft texture that comes from sitting in a steamy warmer for hours before being used.  The "procuitto" in the rollatini was actually sliced smoked ham.  The walnut pesto was so oily that it began to separate on the plate and the red potatoes were a soggy pile of pepper, potato,and oil.  The entire plate was an overcooked, tasteless, and oily mess.If the rollatini was an embarassment, the lasagna was simply careless.  It's composition was sloppy.  The noodles (all two of them) were so liquid heavy that they did not hold their texture.  The sauce was thin and ran out of the lasagne onto the plate, which made the entire dish something like a chunky soup.  The entire thing was a sloppy mess.  A personal annoyance (that doesn't necessarily indicate poor craftsmanship) was that there were chunks of meat the size of my thumbs.Our other food was similarly flawed, but it was the sangria that ruined the evening.  My wife loves sangria.  She loves it enough that she isn't particularly picky about it.  I can totally understand using cheap wine and triple sec (instead of a premium orange liqueur) for the drink.  I can even understand adding a little juice to thin it out if it's too strong.  What I cannot understand is adding water to dilute it.  Typically, if my sangria tastes a watery I assume that it's ice-melt, but this was a degree of watery that I have only tasted before when I went back to a glass sitting in the hot sun that wasn't worth drinking anymore. Our sangria was literally 1/3 water.This is one restaurant that has either confused its catering business with it's sit down service, has gotten sloppy, or thinks that its ambiance is sterling enough to make up for lousy food.  Whatever is the case, I can't imagine ever ordering food there again.I need to preface this by saying that the company was AWESOME!I love ya Kristen if you're reading this, I do. And it was a blast getting to celebrate your birthday with you. But other than that... This place is rrrrrrrrrrrough. 1. A young server who couldn't make strong menu recommendations.2. A negroni that looked like a shirley temple and tasted like nothing I wanted to drink.3. The most flavorless... FLA-VUH-LESS chicken Parmesan I think I've ever eaten. 4. This weird noodle, the name of which I can't remember, that they're supposed to be known for but I can't forget soon enough. Over cooked, mealy, melt in your mouth like you don't want your pasta to do. 5. And honestly, overpriced for the quality and portion size. This place reminds me of Caruso's in Tucson (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carusos-tucson#hrid:6nm_dN4voJ43v98n5IF3PQ). Also Italian. Also an institution. And maybe good back in the day? Sometimes when things get older they age gracefully. And other times they suck harder than a six year-old on a jolly rancher. I know these one star reviews are hard for folks to digest, but so is Porta Bella. When I think about my scale for going as low as I've done so here I think, "is there any redeeming quality that would make it so I would return?" Methinks not.
Tornado Steak House=December?December!That's the last time I took it to the keys to pound out some prose for these guys? Don't ask me why it's taken so long to update my lower level review about the basement which I sort of abstain from now. Don't ask me why it's taken so long to give high praise for the upstairs. And don't ask me how many weekends are spent in low lighting eating one of my favorite steaks on the capital. Their late night (after 10pm) menu is beyond compare. It only has a handful of options but each is incredible. The steak has been and will forever be my jam. At $13 it's a steal, and throw an onion ring the size of my head on top and it's even better! They also have a pretty extensive cocktail situation and I know they'll make you anything you want off the menu. It seems like they might be switching out some wines, because there were some new pages this week when I eyed them over. Staff behind the bar during the week and on weekends is top notch; attentive, conversational, prompt! It's a little tricky to sit in the small booths with more than one other person, but honestly part of the fun is figuring out how you're going to cram two steaks, a basket of fries, cheese curds and two cocktails on a surface the size of a Nilla wafer.I love everything about the Tornado Room. Everything about this place is a throwback to a bygone era, from the wood-paneled walls, low ceilings, and and dim lighting, to the simple menu, complementary garnishes, and delicious cocktails. Even their late-night steak sandwiches are fantastic. If you're looking to get your socks knocked off with a gastronomic experience, go elsewhere. The Tornado is about standard steaks, chops, and fish prepared the old fashioned way, with standard sides like baked potatoes, hashbrowns, and thick-cut vegetables. It's rare at a steakhouse for the sides to be included in the protein prices, but they are at Tornado, which I believe makes this place an extra good value. Order an old fashioned or some recommended wine to wash your meal down, and enjoy every second of the classic fine dining experience. This is not the kind of place you'll have the pleasure of walking into every day.I love this place so much. I remember when I first moved here I would walk by it all the time and pay it no mind. From the outside it always seemed a bit like a dive. How wrong I was! For my second visit it was also during the hours where they have their late night menu. You can get an 8 oz sirloin for 13 bucks which is what I had my heart set on. It got me through the work week knowing that on Friday night I would be having an amazing steak. It's a great deal considering during normal hours their steaks will average 20 to 40 dollars. Fried cheese curds were shared among the table. A friend thought they might actually be better than the old fashioned's cheese curds! The French onion soup I had for an appetizer. It was good but not something I would order again. Both times I've eaten downstairs and the ambiance is wonderful. Cozy, intimate, fun tunes, and great friendly waiting staff.
Pink Lotus Express=...and the challenger "Dance Stuffed in My Pocket" recieves...3 and 1/4 StarsPink Lotus is a decent, clean, hole-in-the-strip-mall americhino classic.Their extensive menus includes all the basics, prepared hot and fresh for you to takeout or dine in, as long as the odd mural on the wall doesn't scare you off.  (pic)The food was pretty good.  General Tsao's chicken is a barometer to me, and Pink Lotus' rendition was a little different.  Think more along the lines of spicy terriyaki than hoysin.  But there were lots of bits of green onion and minced FRESH garlic (I'm still getting garlic burps).  The consistency, as well as the flavor that was underneath the sauce, was more like rough chopped chunks of crispy fried chicken than the usual batter-balls.  Good but a little greasy.Pink Lotus is pretty generous with giving small discounts to deserving community members like military or helathcare workers (pic).They've been hidden on the outside edge of this shopping center for years and I'd never noticed them before.With lunch specials at around $5-6 including drink, more menu research must be done here, clearly.
Cabo Fish Taco=Diners, Drive in and Dives! A must try place! So we trekked out after work yesterday. I love the location, Love the style, people and atmosphere. The place was packed! Everyone seemed to be having a great time and the vibe was hip and cool!Service was a little slow! Chips were average and not fresh, Salsa was nothing much to speak of a bit of a disappointment.I had three taco's Mahi, Shrimp Tara something..... all were good Tara was #1 Shrimp was #2 and Mahi was #3. Mashed Potatoes were forgettableI've heard a lot about Cabo Fish Taco, from friends in Charlotte and from Food Network.  I decided it was time I found out what all the fuss is over.  I'm now left wondering just what, exactly, all the fuss IS over.  Cabo has generated a lot of hype, but does not have the substance to back it up.Given that it was a Saturday night, I assumed there would be a bit of a wait.  We were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes, and the hostess was pretty accurate.  After initially getting our names on the wait list, though, she could have done without immediately telling us we were in her way (in those words, exactly).  We made it to our table, and the waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink orders.  We inquired about the specials on the chalk board, only to find out those were from yesterday and no one got around to updating the sign.  We placed our orders from the regular menu.  And waited.   And waited. And watched other tables, who were seated AFTER us, receive their orders BEFORE us.  Mind you, half the restaurant is still empty.  After 45 minutes of waiting and inattentive service from our waitress, she explained there was a mix up in the kitchen.  She was unable (unwilling?) to compensate us in any way for such poor service.The food finally arrived and I was unimpressed.  It tasted good, but not Food Network, everyone's-talking-about-it good.  The tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland.When you add it all up, and factor in the fact that the place is so loud it's impossible to do more than look at the other people at your table, I felt like I had wasted my money and the better part of my evening on a miserable experience.  Needless to say, I won't be giving Cabo a second chance.
Billy Bob's Steakhouse=Sat at table for 10 minutes no service and no one ever stopped to say we'll be right with you... even though there was waite staff present.  We were about to leave when the waiter came. I said, "wow we were about to leave."  The waiter responds, "Okay you can leave if you want".  OH YES WE LEFT!You want my $50 for steak and lobster and you behave like this and give this kind of service?  I don't think I'll be paying for you to treat me like this. OH YES WE LEFT!When I think of Billy Bob's Steak House, that 1965 oldie "5 O' Clock World"  by the Vogues plays in my head. That is because it's a 5 O' clock world when Billy Bob's opens for business in style with an hour long $12.99 prime rib special that ends at 6 o' clock.   Billy Bob's $12.99 prime rib special is a nice deal that includes a large serving of prime rib with a choice of potato and salad. With a beverage, tax, and tip; the $12.99 prime rib special adds up to $20. Still a good deal.   On a recent visit to Sam's Town, I saw the advertisement for the $12.99 prime rib special. I had to go back to try it. After hiking in Wetlands Park, I treated myself to a post hike dinner at Billy Bob's. Service:     Throughout the dining experience the waiter was friendly and on top of the Coke refills. Fine service from seating myself to paying the check. Ambience:    Billy Bob's is a fun restaurant to dine in. My patio seat was in Mystic Falls Park, Sam's Town's Disneyesque park under an atrium reflecting real sunlight where audio autotronic animals entertain the guests. My table would be a nice spot to take in the laser show. And it isn't everyday, where you are enjoying prime rib to look up and see a realistic bear growling as he looks your way at the same time that birds chirp away, and a waterfall cascades into a Disneyesque park. My table was also along the walking path through the perimeter of Mystic Falls Park. Billy Bob's is also a casual restaurant to dine in. The dining room beyond the bar is dimly lit creating a different environment from Mystic Falls Park. Prime rib dinner:    I was satisfied with the prime rib dinner. After hours of hiking, the $12.99 prime rib tasted like a million bucks. The portions were both quality and quantity. This also included the salad. Now the baked potato with both sour cream and butter could of been a meal in itself. Finally the prime rib, as the picture proceeding the review shows, was large, thick, and juicy. Regardless of a few Swiss cheese shaped spots of fat, I'd give the prime rib four stars. Return factor:   Billy Bob's won me over with two things that I enjoy when dining out: delicious food at a fair price and an upbeat dining environment. Mix the upbeat Disneyland environment of Mystic Falls Park with a tasty prime rib special, oh he'll yeah I'm a fan. I cannot guarantee it, but sometime in the future I am leaning toward returning for the steak and shrimp special. Now if I could only get that song "5 O' Clock World" out of my head.
Louis'grille=Nice folks with good service but the food is nothing great and the setting is a bit dated.You can tell this is a NASCAR themed restaurant with all of the race car hoods and sides mounted to the ceiling and walls and after all, it;s about one mile from Charlotte Motor Speedway.  Pictures of Dale Earnhardt Sr adorn the walls and tables as well.  Problem is the carpet needs to be replaced or at least cleaned, the vinyl seats in the booth we sat at was badly cracked as were all of them. In general in needs a good facelift.The staff is outstanding and we never wanted for anything.  Walking in with the signs on the outside I thought I was entering a typical greek diner and at one time, may have been the case but very Americanized now.I ordered a Steak Sandwich which had very little taste or texture to it. My potato salad side on the other hand was pretty good.  My wife had a Philly Cheese Steak which she described as good but not to the point she would order it again.Maybe it was an off day but nothing great to recommend from our visit today.
Thomas Street Tavern=I felt compelled to write a review of Thomas Street given the unfortunate press that has surrounded it lately.  I've been going to Thomas Street for about 2 years now and it has one of the most ecclectic and diverse crowds I've seen in Charlotte.  During the week, you will find a less crowded more chill scene, and on the weekend it is usually packed after 10:30 (but not in a way that makes it annoying).  The outside patio has cornhole, and ping pong tables -  inside there is pool and foozball.  The bartenders are very down to earth.  The drink prices are the best I've seen in Charlotte, and they are poured generously.  This is NOT a club scene, top 40 kind of place.  You will find a juke box with mostly alternative and classics.  Come dressed down, and be prepared to get comfortable and have a great time.  Oh, and if you are leaving the bar solo at night, a bartender or bouncer is always happy to walk you to your car (in fact, they insist!).There really isn't a bad thing I could say about Thomas Street.  It gets 5 stars because they also allow dogs on the patio :)*Please note, I reviewed Thomas Street Tavern as a bar, not a restaurant.
Jimmy Jack's Drive-In=I'm sorry but I cannot NOT give this place five stars. I know it's hood. I know it's cash only. I know it's host to many shady shady characters. I know this because I can't stop going back. It's all in the Jimmy Jack's experience! I'll tell you this. I've never been accosted by anyone here. The food has always been hot and the prices are a value. The ladies who work the window have always been friendly and prompt. And I've always been able to find parking and a place to sit here. What's there not to like?
Cafe Du Jour=There needs to be more BYOB's in Pittsburgh, just saying! There is something about going out for a long dinner with friends and finishing (3 big) bottles of wine that warms my antioxidant rich heart! I have tried to go here a couple times before but couldn't get a reservation.  There are soo many quaint restaurants like this in Philly and I miss them in the burgh (there is even an interactive BYOB map with the closest liquor stores listed). I went with a man-friend, and the waiter (Matt) was really patient with us because we were taking forever to order.  The menu was interesting but not too over the top so simple palettes aren't overwhelmed. Friendly, Cute, French, Cozy. Perfect. We started which the spinach dip. Delish. I ordered the scallops which was a smaller portion but hit the spot! My friend ordered the salmon which was also delicious. I had a bite of that and I might get that next time! I am going to be honest, We might have drank a huge bottle of wine during the meal and stayed to close.  We left smiling (with purple stained teeth) and full. Pro: Cozy, Outdoor seating (although it was closed), BYOB! BYOB! Delicious food, friendly service, good noise level, BYOB, open kitchenCon: Can be tough to get a res (but thats because its awesome), limited indoor seating, stem charge, cash onlyOverall: Check it out! Great date spot!Sadly, when I think Southside, I'm like the masses who think of a bunch of drunk college kids puking their guts out at 2AM.  What I don't think about is a small little restaurant with upscale food and a laid-back vibe.  This place totally flies under the radar, and it definitely this aspect that makes me like this place so much.  Everything you'll enjoy about this place is completely unexpected (or maybe less so now that I'm telling you!).  When you walk in, you'll notice a small cafe vibe with this surprisingly European like feel: 10 or so small tables are located in the back.  The decoration is somewhat nondescript (we sat next to a refrigerator proudly displaying the "Coke" logo).  What is cool is the fact that the food is literally prepared next to you behind this counter.   The service is among the best I have experienced in this city.  The hallmark of a good waiter is one who anticipates your needs.  For instance, on Valentine's day when I went, I ordered a small cup of soup, and the server was insightful enough to bring out two spoons.  I know, a little detail, but one that matters and makes my experience that much better.Speaking of the food: out of this world.  The menu options are somewhat limited, but I can tell they must change, as do their specials.  There will be a vegetarian option waiting for you.  We started our meal out with bruschetta that came with creamy cheese-spinach sauce with plenty of cubed-seasoned tomatoes: so rich, so creamy, so so good.  The bruchetta was also crisp and warm-simply perfect.  The mushroom soup we shared was full of 4 different types of musrhooms: oyster, shitake, portobello and porcini.  My entree was the eggplant dish: baked eggplant with this sweet pepper sauce, some cheese and...really, I don't know what else but other than the fact it left this little ting in my mouth which when combined with the sweetness of the sauce made for an incredible experience.  My girlfriend enjoyed her salmon dish.  We capped off the meal with chocolate mousse which was simply decadent.  Several other things to note prior to dining here.  1.) Make reservations and make them in advance.  2.) Don't come here expecting full privacy.  Tables are jam packed next to each other.  We definitely had a neighboring couple interrupt us in our conversation since they over-heard something we were talking about that must have appealed them.  Luckily for us, this interaction proved to be quite pleasant and added to our experience, but just a heads up for the rest of you..3.) Cash only, so go to the ATM.  3 course meal for 2 will run you around $80, which certainly isn't bad given the high quality of the food and 4.) BYOB so definitely bring something to complement the fantastic flavor of the food that you are about to enjoy!I cannot wait until the weather warms up again so that I can sit in their outdoor patio. I love that they are BYOB. The spinach and pecorino dip with french baguette is to die for. Make sure to order the large as you will definitely want more! I had the scallops with mango habanero sauce and wild rice along with charred tomatoes. I could have eaten another plate of this -so good! I'm sure that I will be back before the weather warms up for the patio, it is just that good!
Portland's Restaurant & Wine Bar=So I gave Portland's another shot this past weekend, given their $30 summer prix fixe menu and its proximity to my new place.  Like Melissa H said there was a change in the pf menu and the fish I was going to get was replaced with duck, to which I am allergic.  So the pf menu was out.I agree with everything she said about the appetizers.  I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta for my entree and I was less than impressed.  The pasta was incredibly overcooked, it was literally falling apart on my fork.  The shrimp were large and plentiful so I just ended up eating all the shrimp and leaving the shreds of pasta behind.  The strangest part of the meal, for me, was when my entree was brought to the table.  I was informed that they did not have any knives. (!) but "I did bring you a fork"....wow, that is so nice of you!  I was just planning on using my hands to eat the pasta but you thought so much to bring me a fork!  I looked around at all the empty tables around us that had place settings and wondered why they could not have given me one of those place settings which had knives.  (Seriously, by that point we were one of two parties in the restaurant).  I was then left with a choice of a. shoving a whole shrimp into my mouth, b. eating the shrimp off the fork in a klassy corn dog type of fashion or c. cutting the shrimp with my fork.  (I opted for c. and it was pretty difficult to do...)  My conclusion on Portland's is that the food is consistently mediocre (sometimes even below mediocre) and it functions best as a place to have a drink.I enjoyed my first two visits to Portland's. During my last visit we sat up at the bar and ordered some food as well as drinks. *shocker*  My friend and I split a medium rare filet with accompanying sides. (something that resembled scalloped potato's and something else I don't recall... don't judge, I had a glass of wine under my belt)Anyway, the steak was cooked as requested and everything was pretty tasty. I wasn't insanely impressed (hence the 3 stars) and while it was all decent, nothing stood out. The space is cute and modern yet has an odd layout. I don't see the restaurant side getting too much action but I could be wrong. One thing I will never understand....and this goes for many places, I'm not just picking on Portland's.What is the deal with the surly ass bartenders in the mid-down town area of Phoenix. I know that because you bartend down town you think you're hip and rad and all that nonsense....(are those glasses even prescription??)  but you wouldn't last a fucking minute serving in countless other cities with that attitude. Just sayin..... go to NYC "rockstar" and see how fast you're chewed up and spit out. Maybe you're a true asshole.... maybe you just need a little more fiber in your diet, i dunno...but whatever it is, figure it out somewhere else. Thanks.It was a Thursday night when my friend and I decided to stop at Portland's for a bite and a glass of wine. We walked in to an empty restaurant, which made me nervous. We were greeted and told we could sit wherever we would like. We chose to sit in a window seat. A friendly waitress came over and asked us if we'd like something to drink. We decided on a few glasses of wine after some suggestions from her. My dinner partner went to the restroom to wash his hands and when he came back he said "This place hasn't been top to bottom cleaned in a LONG time. Probably since they opened!" He said that there was built up dust on the air vents. Don't ask me why he was staring at the ceiling, he just happened to. The news made me wonder about the top to bottom cleanliness of their kitchen.. hmm... We chose to proceed with ordering food. We chose the Tommy burger and the Alfredo burger. The Tommy burger had Applewood-smoked bacon, Stilton blue cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo. The Alfredo burger had roasted poblano peppers, jalapeno mayo, lettuce and tomato. You have to order the fries ala carte. They don't come with the burger, which was kind of silly. We went with an order of Parmesan fries and an order of Cajun fries. While waiting for our food, I asked the waitress why the place was so empty. She said "It's Downtown Phoenix at night!" Um...has she spent any time in Downtown Phoenix lately? I told her that we had just come from another, larger establishment that had just opened and the place was packed. She said "I'd like to see them when all of the buzz has died down." She may be right, but it makes no sense that a restaurant that is connected to a LARGE apartment complex, next to a hotel, right on the light rail is almost empty on a Thursday night. Our food arrived and I was surprised by the burgers. They were served on plain ol' Wonderbread hamburger buns. Yeah, those. I took a bite into my burger and it was good! Not stellar, not amazing, just good! I didn't mind the plain ol' bun after a while. Honestly, sometimes the bun overpowers the burger. The fries were ok. Again I wasn't blown away. They were just fine. The bill came and that's when I minded the plain ol' bun. I remembered that the Tommy burger was $11 and the Alfredo burger was $9. The cups of fries were $4 each. Well that puts a different spin on things. For the quality of food we had, we were definitely short-changed. What do you expect out of an $11 burger? Think about it. Portland's has SO MUCH potential, but they give off a bar-fly attracting vibe instead of a Downtown Clientele vibe. Would I go back? Yeah, maybe during a burger special night, but I don't know if I would seek out Portland's for a nice dinner again. We'll see.
Taco Bell=Why am I reviewing a taco bell? I've been bar hopping and have to get up for work in 6 hours. Bless you 24hr taco bell, where else can you order the whole right side of menu for $10???? Tonite I salute the brave workers dealing with drunks and those getting their munchies on, BRAVOWe have NEVER had a togo order that has been correct from here. EVERI am talking about 9-10 years worth...
First Watch=This is a Breakfast ,Lunch place that used to be beyond Great!We really loved coming here many years ago.The same people worked here and it was always a pleasure to come in.Food was wonderful and so was the service.Then things started to change. The food was not as good,They changed the menu up.  Then the staff started to change.When you start losing all the staff you have had for so many years something is not right inside the company.The service and food really went downhill.So we stopped coming here.Well, lately I have been back 2x's. Things are better. They are trying.But, it is still not the same. However, service is fast again, and they do check on you all the time. Food is working it self back up the hill.Maybe they should fo more organic or something.It is still a good place, just not what it was.This is in my neighborhood but didn't even know it existed, probably because it was mostly hidden from view by I-17 and its fences. So it was good that Rand H. invited me to join him and Mike C. here for weekday brunch.  This place has friendly service, a sunny interior with a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable, if slightly cramped, booths and tables. I ordered "The Works" which is an omelet with ham, bacon, sausage, crimini mushrooms, onions and tomatoes with cheddar and monterey jack. topped with sour cream, and chose a mixed green salad as a side. The omelet was good and was a moderate-size portion; it would still qualify as a light lunch. The mixed green salad was nothing special. The coffee was delicious and was refilled in a timely manner. I would not hesitate to bring friends to for a nice leisurely breakfast or lunch.
China Pantry=China Pantry is located in the food court of the Las Vegas Premium outlets. Right in the middle of a busy shopping spree with my cousins, I found myself ordering a three item combo to share from here. For a little under $8, I got a combo with fried rice, noodles, chicken teriyaki, chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms. Pros: It was a decent amount of food! They don't really give a lot but it is enough to get you decently full. The chicken teriyaki was nice and lean! There was a good amount of chicken in the chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms (meaning it wasn't all veggies).Taste wise the food was pretty good. The chicken dishes were flavorful! The curry sauce was good. The teriyaki was just the right amount of sweet! Cons: I didn't order anything to drink but did ask for water. The lady working there gave me a cup of water and when I asked for another (since I was sharing this meal), she said only one water per customer :(.It's an OK place. A little bit pricey which is to be expected since it is at a food court at a popular outlet.
Steiner's Nevada Style Pub=I'm probably going to get raked across the coals since this is def. a locals favorite.Thanksgiving at Steiner's:  1.  First of all, it was freezing.  In the restaurant.  Warmer outside.  I kept my coat on as we were seated.2.  We were seated at a tabled, ordered, received our drinks, told we had to move to another table since our current table was reserved for people who NEVER SHOWED UP.  The manager actually told the waitress to have us move IN FRONT OF US, having the waitress be the bad guy rather than dirty her own hands.3.  I asked if I could order the pumpkin pie separately out of the Thanksgiving deal.  I was told no.  Even asked if I could pay EXTRA.  Nope, no bueno.   I went next door and gave my money to the grocery store and ate an entire one following said meal.4.  My sandwich was cold.  HOWEVER!  The fries were delicious, and seasoned very well.So  I dropped by months later overnight, you know, non-Thanksgiving to try them out on a regular late night.The bartender was cranky, when we asked if could change out potatoes for french fries, a short, "We don't do that here" was thrown back at us.  Unfriendly, uninspiring, average prices.  Good fries, though.
The Zenith=My new favorite brunch spot in the 'burgh!  It's all vegetarian, and sooo good.  Definitely worth waiting in the line that forms before this place opens up on Sunday.You pick an entree, usually there are french toast and scramble options--last time I went, there was even a BBQ seitan sandwich.  I went with lemon artichoke stew, which was heavenly.  There are also different herbal teas, juices, and coffee to choose as a beverage.The best part is the buffet line--close to 30 different salads (veggie, pasta, and fruit) to choose from and a whole table full of pies and cakes. The dishes are fiestaware and different antique pitchers and glasses from the Zenith's antique store.  The atmosphere is cute and kitschy, and you can buy any of the art on the walls.I will definitely be back for brunch on future Sundays, I might even try lunch or dinner here as well.  The Zenith is a great little place!I visited the Zenith yesterday for Sunday brunch with fellow Yelper Chelsea S.  We'd been wanting to do brunch together for awhile, so I suggested the Zenith, since I knew it was near where she lives and I'd heard it was a really unique and cool brunch venue.  Although neither of us are vegetarian or had tried a vegetarian brunch before, we're both game to try new things, so we decided to check it out.The first thing you notice when walking into the Zenith is the interesting kitschy antiques everywhere--including suspended from the ceiling.  Unlike the Beehive coffeeshop further down Carson St., which has similar interesting decor, it's my understanding that these items--as well as the tables, chairs, flatware, etc.--can be purchased.  I'm not sure of the range of prices, since I didn't inquire, though.The second thing that became apparent, which I didn't realize from reading previous reviews, is that parties of two are mostly seated together with other pairs (i.e., communal/family style seating).  That wasn't a problem for us, since our tablemates were interesting conversation partners, but if you're a couple looking for an intimate/romantic brunch venue, you may wish to look elsewhere.  If, on the other hand, you're game for meeting new people, by all means, check it out!As for ordering, the setup is a hybrid of a prix fixe and a brunch buffet.  All of the entrees, which change on a weekly basis, are the same price ($11.50), which also includes coffee or tea with unlimited refills.  (I had herbal tea.)  Once you order, you have access to the buffet tables, one of which focuses on salads and fruit/vegetable side dishes, and the other of which contains an assortment of bundt cakes.For my entree, I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I was expecting wafer-thin flapjacks, but they turned out to be quite thick, moist, and cakey--in a good way. This entree was proof that vegetarian fare can be quite filling!  I wasn't as much of a fan of the side dish that came with it (not sure what exactly it was), but it added some welcome savoriness.  As it were, my selections from the vegetable buffet table added the savoriness I needed to offset the sweetness of the pancakes.  They included pasta salad, thai peanut noodles (?), chickpea salad, spinach salad, a piece of bread, and some fruit, as well.  All of them were quite good, and also filling in their own right.  Finally, I sampled several of the bundt cakes (double chocolate, vanilla blueberry, poppy seed lemon, and orange lavender (?)).  While I enjoyed all of them, too, my favorite was the double chocolate, due to its moistness. If you don't have as much of a sweet tooth as me, you may prefer some of the other flavors, which were less sweet.I'm definitely glad that I tried the Zenith's brunch buffet, since it's one of the most unique brunches in PGH, for sure.  Even if you're leery of vegetarian food, I'd encourage you to check it out--I daresay you'll be pleasantly surprised!  And, of course, it was great to share the experience with a fellow Yelper (Chelsea S.), as well as our table mates, and make some new friends while enjoying a delicious brunch!
Kerry's Sports Pub Pizza & Grill=I'm so glad this place decided to treat my friends and I like scum, I love that! -Waiting 20 minutes for simple food? Check!-20 minute wait for any type of communication from the waitress? Check!-Attitude from said waitress? Check!-Giving us the bullshit fake line about the Credit Card minimum? DOUBLE CHECK!This was basically the visit from hell and assured that our weekly happy hour meetups will no longer be taking place here. Congrats Kerry's! You have lost yourself steady business.
Lombardinos Italian Restaurant and Bar=I blame myself. My expectations were high. Not sure why, but they were.I found no fault, per se, in any of the dishes we ordered, yet I wasn't blown away. I didn't have that eager-for-the-next-bite kinda feeling that I always hope for; everything just seemed average.As usual, our party ordered an appetizer of calamari to enjoy alongside the complimentary bread and olive oil. No complaints. Though I didn't dig into either too much.As far as entrees, we ordered:*Butter pasta and parmesan*Wood-grilled paprika sausage and octopus w. red potatoes, chickpeas, swiss chard, san marzano tomato, and saffron aioli*Chicken milanese of parmesan and breadcrumb chicken w. salsa verde and fried egg, served on polenta*Orechiette with fraboni's sausage and rapini w. roasted garlic-steeped cream and a splash of brandy*8oz cider brined pork loin chop w. yukon golds, seared escarole, grilled lemon & tuscan olive oil Of everything that we ordered, what most stands out for me as enjoyable was the pork loin chop. I was able to try a few bites and quite enjoyed the dish. So I wouldn't rule this place out right away. I plan on giving it another try, as some other dish may pleasantly surprise me.
Seven Seas Restaurant & Lounge=I heard about this place through a bank teller that hada sign in front of his window that portrayed his favorite food.. "..burgers.." So I asked, "What's the Best Burger you've had here in Vegas?" He replies "At the Seven Seas, it's in the ghetto.. The Louis Burger, tell me what you think.."Place wasn't as bad as I thought.. I walked in the food side entrance (the other went straight to the bar/lounge), looked up at the menu and saw the Burger.. surrounded by a whole lotta southern lovin' comfort food items! MMMMMmmmMMMMM! But that time I was there for one thing only.Louis Burger: plump buns, thick stubby patty, red onion, tomato, lettuce.... came with a mound of fries.. The burger had a nice char, quite juicy, tender, that familiar home grilled flavor but a little too salty for my taste.. Reminded me of a Smash Burger and a Gorden Biersch Burger at same time.. The fries were decent but a little over greased in my opinion. Extra Friendly and Corteous Staff, Prices were fair (cash only), location wasn't that bad, dining area cozy.. The Bar/Lounge was playing some smooth Jazz/R&B Jams.. Nice! Looked like a popular African American hang out. Burger and fries were decent overall. I may comeback to have their catfish or chicken?!..I forgot about this hole in the wall!  If your afraid to go into the not so glamorous, upscale, part of Las Vegas, and you just want some real food!  I would say go here.  They open about 12:00.  If your not use to this area, I would suggest to go maybe before 5 p.m.  We went on a Thursday night.  It was an older crowd in the bar area, it was a "step'n night"  so the crowd is different on this night, than on a Friday - Saturday night. Now don't go in here thinking your going to get what you ordered in 4 - 5 min.  Nope!  That isn't going to happen.  They cook to order!  And it is worth the wait.  The chicken is so crunchy and seasoned!  I can say it's better than mine!  I love crunchy chicken.  The Catfish is the bomb.com!  Yep, I think it's the best place to get fried catfish in this town. And if you know, like I know, it's hard to find.   The greens were good, and the fries are good.  They have yams (I don't care for yams) I'm not sure what else.  So, go place your order, and go sit at the bar, and have a drink or 2.  It will take about 30 min. for them to fry up that yummie chicken!
61C Cafe=I hate to do this, but based on my experience last night, I feel that I need to write an update and decrease my rating.  First, the positives: The baristas last night (both female) were very helpful and upbeat, unlike the baristas I'm used to dealing with here.  One of them made me an awesome smoothie consisting of blueberries, pineapple, cherry, and pear (see photo), and it was amazing.  My only complaint is that I noticed there was some left over from the blending, and it would have been nice to have offered it to me (though I didn't notice until too late).  I also ordered a mocha cappuccino that was pretty good, and well-caffeinated, as my friends can attest by my high-energy talkativeness after drinking it.Despite these positives, we encountered several issues.  First, one of my friends ordered a red velvet biscotti, and tasted a moldy flavor when he bit into it (I confirmed the odd taste).  He informed them of the problem, and they did credit him for it, but I'm not sure if they discarded the rest of that type of biscotti.  Second, when I went to use the bathroom to wash up, the toilet seat was sporting some pretty gross stains (please pardon the graphic image).  Third, when we returned our dishes when we went to leave, I noticed that one of the "clean" water cups had some serious residue from some other drink.  I grabbed it and placed it with our dirty dishes, but still, the baristas should eyeball them before placing them in the clean stacks, so that obviously dirty cups don't end up there.In general, I still like the 61C and most of what they serve, and my friends and I will probably be back, since it's convenient for them and a great hang out spot.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt of half of a star due to the friendly service and delicious smoothie, but they really need to take care of the blatant issues I mentioned to avoid scaring people away.  3.5 stars.From the outside, the 61C cafe looks really dumpy and rundown.  I have walked past here hundreds of times and not come in due to the exterior.  However, one hot day, Laura M's review seduced me to come here to try a smoothie.After trying to order a strawberry, orange, banana smoothie, I was quickly told that they were out of most of their smoothie ingredients.  This frustrates me unbelievably when places put things on a chalkboard that are not available.  It's chalk.  Erase it.  However, with some help from the barista, I ordered a blueberry, apple, banana smoothie ($5.62 w tax).  The smoothie was quite delicious, and they used real fruit and no syrup.  The bananas were a bit brown and over-ripe, but I really loved the unique combination options.  I would definitely like to try some of the other smoothie options in the future.Cash only.
Shanghai Express=If you are on the west-side and in the need for some decent Americanized Chinese, this is a great spot. First off this place is dirt cheap and the servings are ginormous! The menu is actually quite large for the kind of place that it is, with all the usual suspects (some of them even surprisingly tasty). They have a daily special that is around $3 bucks and is basically a bowl of rice topped with whatever the selection may be. All entree items can either be ordered in a combination form (with rice, crab puff, egg roll) for around $5, or a la carte for around $6.50. The a la carte is a large clam shell full of your choice - my personal favorites are the orange chicken, the house chicken, and the pork fried rice. Seriously, I could probably devour an entire clam shell of their orange chicken; it's the perfect amount of crunch and spice! And at $3.50, I can nosh on a quart of Hot and Sour soup (basically until I can stand no more). The owners/staff are incredibly nice (ex: they literally will call you by name upon your second visit). The decor is really plain, but it's always clean and tables are attended to quickly. They offer take out and delivery (if you are in the general area). But this is one of my goto places if I want something fast. I simply call in my order, hop in my car and in the 5 to 7 minutes it takes me to get there, they have my order prepped and ready to go. Their hours are roughly 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. - Monday through Saturday but if you are on the cusp, I would recommend calling ahead, as on occasion family issues force them to adjust. If you are in the neighborhood of 35th Ave and Thomas, give them a try and see if you don't agree that they are A-OK and recession friendly. : )
Carson Street Deli & Craft Beer Bar=I dropped in unexpectedly with CM for a snack around 7:30 last night.  CM was hungry because he hadn't eaten dinner, and we were expecting to try one of the breakfast sandwiches at Delanie's Coffee, where we were originally planning to head.  However, the barista there apologetically informed us that he turned off the oven at 7, since it takes a long time to cool down.  He recommended Carson St. Deli as an alternative place to get a sandwich, which I recognized as a place that I'd bookmarked on Yelp, so we headed on over.CM ordered the Mark Cuban ($8.25), a variant on the classic cuban sandwich.  This version substituted chicken for the pulled pork, a roll for the bread, and was toasted rather than being pressed like a panini, judging by the meltiness of the Swiss cheese.  Although I didn't try it, CM was very pleased with this sandwich, which satiated his hunger well.  As for me, I had to order the Donnie Brasco ($8.25), a layered egg salad and buffalo chicken sandwich, based on other reviewers' comments.  This was one of the more unique sandwiches I've eaten.  It was quite flavorful and substantial, and was bookended by good quality Italian bread.  However, it was one of the messiest sandwiches I've ever eaten, due to the mayonnaise and buffalo sauce and the small pieces of hard boiled egg and chicken.  Fortunately, CM and I have reached the point where we're comfortable eating messy foods in front of one another, so it wasn't an issue.  ;-)The ambiance was surprisingly quiet for a bar, due to the fact that there was only a couple of other customers when we were there, and that the TVs were muted.  We enjoyed the oldies music that was playing, which somehow seemed appropriate for a sandwich shop such as this.  Service from an older gentleman I'm guessing may be the owner was friendly and pretty efficient.  One quirky thing that caught us off guard is that if you eat in, you pay after you finish eating, rather than when you order. In retrospect, however, this makes sense in light of this place being a bar, given that many people probably want to run a tab.  (I didn't think of this since we didn't have anything to drink.)  Although the prices have gone up a bit, we felt that they were still pretty reasonable (total check: $16.50).  Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience here, and would definitely return in the future.I belong to a MeetUp group called "Strange Brew". We're a group of craft beer enthusiast who get together once a month and we each bring a beer that, hopefully, no one has tried before (that's the challenge, finding one during the weeks leading up to our MeetUp). We've been doing this for over three years, alternate between only two establishments; last night it was the Carson Street Deli. I got there at about 6:00, commandeered some tables and looked over the menu wondering what I would get tonight. After a few other members showed up, I decided on the Real New Yorker's New Yorker Sandwich that comes with a mixture of hot pastrami and corned beef topped with melted swiss and deli mustard on a grilled marbled rye. I also ordered a Lavery, Lá Bealtaine White Fire Wheat to compliment it. One of my fellow Strange Brew members ordered the Dizzy Lizzy which is a pita wrap with curried grilled chicken, fresh slaw, dried cranberries and sliced almonds.  She looked at my sandwich and I looked at hers and we decide to trade half of our sandwiches with each other. They were both amazing (if you can say that about a deli sandwich), super fresh and the right amount of ingredients presented with simplicity.  Now can we talk about beer? Twenty craft beers on tap should be able to get you lubed up enough to make your way over to the cooler section where they stock over 300 craft beers. You can mix and match beers of your choosing and if you put together a six pack you get $2.00 off each beer. But what we (Strange Brew Meetup Members) like most about the place though is the atmosphere. This establishment is always spotlessly clean, the wait staff is extremely courteous and attentive and we, as a group, are always made to feel welcome each time we get together here.  What is also cool about the Carson Street Deli is that there's a patio out back with a garden like feel to it that we take advantage of during the warmer months to get away from the hustle and bustle that can be the South Side.  If you can't tell by now, let me just say that I like it there. If you're in the South Side and looking for a good sandwich and a high end craft beer to swish it down with, I would highly recommend the Carson Street Deli. It's so much more than a "deli" thus deserving of a five star rating.
Sticklers=I saw the review of the day today and had to throw in my two cents. This is my least favorite lunch stop I've ever been to downtown. It's usually suggested by someone in the office who just wants a red sandwich meat sandwich and wants it fast. Then the rest of us have to suffer too. Very typical sandwiches like turkey, roast beef, etc, etc. I might like the place better if I ate alot of red meat. The people I go with swear that the "Traffic Jam" sandwich (a cluster fuck of different red sandwich meats) makes it worth the trip. The toppings are very pedestrian and limited. They will charge you to put something "fancy" like black olives on it.I would also challenge the "clean" assertion made by another reviewer. Although they have a ton of employees to run a pretty tight ship in terms of making sandwiches quick and cleaning up, we have had several incidents of finding questionable or disgusting items in the food we've ordered so as to make many  people in my office never want to go back.I give them one star for making a decent sandwich that I could've made just as easily at home and for cheaper. The second star is for their milkshakes which are made with real ice cream in front of you and are pretty good. Go to Sacks, duck and decanter, downtown deli, or one of dozens other downtown sandwich places first before here.
Thai Rama=While it won't win any design awards, I did have a fantastic view to the west of a majestic Arizona sunset. I actually ordered to go and was able to sit while waiting and soak in the energy of Thai Rama. A slow Monday night had two straighty couples (yes, you heteros, you know who you are) holding hands and nibbling slowly. The walls were adorned with pictures of Thai royalty. I think anyway. It could just be a promo poster from a vendor. I don't know. And Bud Light signs. Ahhh...America! The Thai beer I enjoyed while waiting certainly helped pass the time. Service here is extrordaniarly friendly, like most Thai places I've encountered. I purposely over ordered as I wanted left overs. Pad Thai. Outstanding. After that I recommend numbers 1, 7, 23 and 27. Paint by number. Order by number. It's simple. And everyone's gonna love it. Thai Thai for now yelpers!P.S. The #18 soup is so amazing...lemon grass and coconut milk. Dee lish!I can't bring myself to give Thai Rama more than 3 stars... I love Thai food, and I wanted to love Thai Rama, but I just didn't.  I thought the restaurant itself was cute, casual, and unassuming... the staff was friendly but not the most attentive.  I was there on a Sunday night recently, and I felt extremely comfortable dining solo (big plus for that).Unfortunately, when I was given my menu, there was a dried up noodle stuck to it, and the napkins on the tables are pretty but polyester and not the best for wiping the noodle off or absorbing anything at all for that matter.  I was also disappointed that I didn't see a thai salad with peanut dressing or summer rolls on the menu.  I decided to order the #6 to start - Lab Gai (finely chopped chicken lightly sauteed in lemon juice with red onion and mint).  Maybe I should've ordered it without onion because onion was everywhere!  The flavor of the chicken was good, but it was difficult to eat with so much onion.  I went with the vegetarian dish #69 (yes, I said 69) as my entree.  Paht Paug Jae or vegetable deluxe.  I requested that they add eggplant and they did - it was pretty tasty and I cleaned my plate with that one.Overall, the meal was ok.  Maybe I'm spoiled by some other thai favorites in the valley, but I'm glad I experienced Thai Rama.  I probably will not rush back, but if you're looking for a decent thai meal and you're in the Cen Pho area, you can find it at Thai Rama.i have never been to Thai Rama. i have always wanted to try it. but it wasn't really close or convenient to go to. i happened to be in the area so figured would check it out. food was less then spectacular. after 20 years...i am not really sure if it's just down graded from quality or bad suppliers. i don't know. the spring rolls. totally from a box, flash frozen. the insides were mushy and the flavors not distinct. also got the won tons. saving grace here. they were good. the pork nugget inside of it could stand to be a bit bigger. it is dwarfed by the won ton wrapper. still was really good. i have chosen to make Pad Thai as my barometer for Thai restaurants I'm going to review on Yelp. if they cannot make this "signature" dish then the rest of the menu might as well be rat poison. the pad Thai was flavorful, the noodles were a tasty pile of mush. it had really long mung beans which i like. so it wasn't all bad. in fact it wasn't bad tasting. but honestly for 9+ bucks. i could have picked this up at Safeway from a box called "Taste of Thai" for 2.50 and cooked it myself. atmosphere is ok. kinda old, cute menus with home made paper. with the menu items printed on a transparency. hmm. now that i think about it..it's kinda cheese. but whatever. service was good. quick turn around. and my glass was only empty twice....but to think about it..they only filled it twice...so it was empty.....so that means...i was thirsty..and my drink was empty. hmmm ok thats kinda nit picky. it was fine. 3-4 stars if the food was umm fresher. or at least not supplied by sysco. in conclusion. this place might have been around for 20 years. but when there are not better options. [Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, even Thai Hut...] and your the only Thai restaurant in a 20 mile radius...you can last. but i shouldn't need to point out...that you have some serious competition in the area..and their prices are about the same.i really wanted to make a funny review about this place. but lets face it. Thai food is seriez bizness, only deserving a serious review.7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great.... All dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup... its new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P walks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K... As soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :) the lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?! in the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed... as soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said "Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? "um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... " he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird he got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score! once we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing... he had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli... so the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm then he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!? once we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying "pardon me or excuse me" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified! End Result.... Good Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :) The Service was nice... Nice atmosphere... Horrible date... Wish i had had better company :( oh and i Tossed out his number...
KFC=I'll be honest, I completely forgot Yelp existed.  Lots of my friends are Elite Yelpers, and since there haven't been many events over the past few months, their conversation topics have switched from "Oh my god the next OYE sounds fuckin awesome!" to "I haven't gotten any free food/drinks and Yelp branded schwag in forever waaahhhhhh!!!!"  So when I went to the UYE at The Vig Uptown last night with Georgie S, stuffed my face with cheap grub and Bud Lights, stuffed my pockets with lets just call it "a couple" Yelp coozies and packs of Orange-heads, I remembered this little website and figured I'd fill you in on what I've been eating since the last OYE.  God damn that was a long sentence.KFC Double Down muthafuckas!!!!!!!Yes, that's right, I've literally eaten KFC Double Downs for every meal for..... when did they come out?...... I don't know whenever they came out.  If you don't know what a Double Down is, then you obviously don't watch enough ESPN and other channels that target fat lazy dudes.  The KFC Double Down is the brainchild of what must be the fattest genius on Earth, designed specifically to trigger the glutton-reflex in the human brain.Picture this:Take a delicious chicken sandwich from your favorite joint.Put bacon and a sweet tangy sauce on it.  Hungry aren't ya?But something is missing right?NOW TAKE THOSE TWO PANSY ASS PIECES OF BREAD, THROW THAT SHIT BACK INTO THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW, AND SAY "GIMME ANOTHER PIECE OF CHICKEN BITCH!You don't need bread!  Just put the freakin bacon and sauce IN BETWEEN the chicken filets!  You like grilled chicken?  Get grilled chicken.  You like fried chicken?  Get fried chicken.  Or you can follow in my Chicken Jesus-like footsteps and get one of each.  QUADRUPLE DOWN!!!Seriously, I know most of you are all "GROSS!!" and thinking that I must be a raging alcoholic or constantly high to like this thing, but trust me, IT. IS. INCREDIBLE.  Eat a bunch of salads all week and tell yourself that you're healthy, go get a KFCDD, a 40 of OE, and sit on your ASS and enjoy the wonders of a true poultry masterpiece.  Plus you need protein homie, you're lookin a little flaco.  Yeah, you.  If you need me, I'll be in the drive thru.
Mario's Westside Market=I never would have that Mario's Westside Market served Louisiana style cooking.  A friend told me about this place so I thought I'd give it a try.  As soon as I walked in the place, the cashiers greeted me but the customers were staring me down like they never seen a Filipino kid before. Oh well.  I went straight to the back of the market where they served the hot food.  Everything looked good and fresh!  I asked if there was any deals.  The guy helping me said "the deal is, you hook the jar up, I hook you up.". So I did just that.  They charge by the pound here just like Smiths or Albertsons would charge you where the hot food is.  I got 2 lbs of catfish, 1 lb of porkchops, a pound of Mac n Cheese, and half a pound of potato wedges to-go. I took it home and the smell blessed my car and my house.  The catfish was cooked to perfection, crunchy on the outs and tender on the in's and the seasonings were just right! Porkchops were OK, it was way too salty. The Mac n cheese was the best, no complains about that.  But the potato wedges were horrible! It tasted like it was cooked in very old oil and it was stale! Ranch or ketchup couldn't save it.  Other than that, I had a good experience with Mario's.  If I want some good catfish and Mac n Cheese, Mario's is the place to be.I would've given this establishment a complete 5 star rating but there is only one thing that honestly brought the experience down, the sides. I had initially heard of this place through friends and coworkers and was strongly recommended. All I ever heard about this place is that the catfish was to die for. A friend from work offered some to me on one occasion and though it was a bit cold when I tasted it, the crunchiness and flavor of it was so amazing. I needed to try it fresh, and soon!I decided to go a couple of weeks later, and though it may not be in the best location it is completely worth going to! The line was a bit long when I arrived but moved fairly quickly. I decided to get 4 catfish filets and a side of hush puppies (an order has 8). I took it home, open it up and inhaled that delicious steam that rose from the box, this alone made my mouth water. The crunch on the filets wad that of fried chicken but not heavy or greasy. Still very delicate and light. A small drizzle of lemon or hot sauce is honestly all you need as you want to taste the freshness of this fish. On to the hush puppies which was the reason I did not give this place 5 stars. When I first bit into one I noticed that it was spongy. A spongy feeling that happens when things have been reheated a few times. Seasoning and flavoring was there but not freshness. Marios is a great local gem that everyone is Las Vegas needs to visit at least once. The cooks definitely know what they are doing with their fish.Because I'm all about that catfish-- and Mario's is some of the best I've EVER had. Being from south Texas, it's been hard to find southern-style gulf seafood, but Mario does catfish right. The batter is light and full of flavor, you won't even miss the tartar sauce and the hot sauce is entirely optional. Sides of mac and greens taste like they were made with someone's grandma's recipe, they're that good. Location is a bit odd- head in anyway, and hang a left to  the back of the store. If there's a line (and there will be), suck it up and wait. Buy by the pound or purchase a meal, but don't go without getting catfish. They also offer chicken tenders, wings, and a bunch of other sides, but it's probably best to stick to the basics before branching out.Eat in at their small dine-in area by the coolers of sodas, or grab yours to go- if it's too far from home, you can always take it to the nearby Lorenzi park. You'll need to break a sweat after eating this kind of meal.
Prommares Thai Food=Located on the corner of Torrey Pines and Sahara is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.  The name Prommares is after the Hindu god Praprom the deity of fortune and good luck.I love coming here for lunch because they have great lunch specials.  It's just the basic Thai dishes, but everything here is always fresh and authentic.  I always get the Pad See-Eew ( I think that's the one w/ the Chinese broccoli and the flat pan fried noodles) It's always perfect and so is the Tom Kai soup.I like that its a small family owned restaurant w/ a small and intimate setting.  It's never really crowded and the service is fast and friendly.Much like my last GF, PTF ain't a looker, but she gets the job done. A-OK in my book. Came in to this small joint around 2pm to pick up some lunch. I was hooked before I even stepped inside. Why? There's a sign on the door "24oz soup, $2". Deal! After being seated, service was prompt and friendly. My order of ginger tofu with rice, (mini) egg roll and a soup set me back about $7 and was the perfect medium heat at spice level 5. Am i going out of my way to come back here? Nah, but I wouldn't hesitate to return when looking for lunch in the area.
China Harvest Buffet=I wanted to update the review since China Harvest has updated their decor!If you've been there in the last few years, you've seen the weird shade of green that accented all of the white-ish walls.  If you're like me, you grew to like the odd green color for its strangely soothing quality; I can't help but be reminded of a 1940's mental institution.Well that has all changed (KIND OF) since the walls have a fresh coat of off-white-wash, and the accent color has been changed to a lovely, putrid, baby shit yellow-brownish; I can't help but be reminded of the classy and stylish 1960's Harvest Gold kitchen appliances.Technically, it is an improvement, although you have to question the judgement call on the color selection.  Perhaps for the person in charge of that choice, the mental institution green was just a little too appropo?!?They also put up some very nice wide-slat wood blinds with a medium dark wood stain tint.  They do a great job at blocking out the harsh sun, or even harsher Food City parking lot that graces your window view.Still cheap and still usually great, just not consistent.  Another recent improvement is steamed white rice in a rice cooker for you to scoop from instead of from a dish on the steamtable.  Keeps the rice nice and fluffy instead of it turning into crunchy toothbreakers.Still my 4 star goto cheapo china boofay.It is funny how things work. I took my 12 year old here to eat because she wanted Chinese Boo-fay. I decided to look at Uncle Ryan C's reviews because he knows cheap Boo-fays. This one was the highest rated and closest to the house. So how bad could it be. In fact he had lunch here the very same day. Location -1 star, this strip mall sucks. There were guys smoking 2 ft from the door. The building is U&gt;G&gt;L&gt;Y stuff falling off the overhang, bad paint, i almost got ran over walking out to my car, sketchy patrons etc. Interior -1 star this place was a Carrows at one time I am sure of it. When is the last time you saw a Carrows in Phoenix.... yep the decor is that old. As mentioned they recently painted and hung blinds. I could not imagine this place before. Service 3 stars very nice attentive and not intrusive. Food 2 stars at best. The food was just there. Nothing stood out, nothing was horrible. I sampled almost everything there except the seafood. I had made a deal with my colon years ago to stop eating buffet seafood. Ice cream machine -1 star... would have rather had ice chips. I doubt I would be back. There are plenty of other cheap places that have higher quality nicer ambiance and closer to my house.
Papa John's Pizza=After a full day of fighting crowds and traffic, who really wants to cook? Not me. We ordered a pizza online. Papa John's had it delivered in 32 minutes, still hot and still fresh. Good flavor, good coverage of toppings. I'd order from this location again.Tip: Check the specials before you pick your pizza. It's possible that you can get a deal for the same price or less.I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.
Mediterranean Cafe=If you're looking for a great plate of food in Madison for under $10, you just aren't going to do any better than Mediterranean Cafe. I believe it's run by a father/son from Algeria, so it's more Middle-Eastern-focused, but none of the food is really that foreign/adventurous, just solid, typical Arabic-style mediterranean food. It's unassuming from the outside (and pretty cramped on the inside), but the food is always superb.I typically get the lamb shawarma plate, which comes with lamb, hummus, mixed greens salad and pita bread. The hummus is awesome, and the creaminess is really great in contrast with the vinegar-based salad dressing, which is great as well. The lamb and pita bread are pretty standard, but definitely solid. In my opinion, though, the real star of MedCaf is the deliciously-minty Algerian tea. I'm by no means a tea connoisseur, but trust me: You'll wish you could make it at home. As I said, it can get cramped inside, but if you can get a seat, there's very little wait time. It's a great ethnic interior, with flags adorning the walls. The staff always thanks you when you leave, which, though it doesn't seem like a big deal, is really a nice touch. I do wish it was open more often, but it kind of adds to the exclusivity of the place. A really great eating experience overall, and like I said, for under $10, with an entree and the amazing tea.One last thing: This is a cash-only place, so don't be a n00b and come in without any dough.Let's get this out of the way first:  -Cash Only-Vinyl plastic table covers-No outside food/drinks-A chalkboard menu of items that slowly gets erased as the day wears on-Line out the door, and you can only get a booth during the lunch-time rush if you have a party of 3 or more (They _will_ ask you to move).This place clearly does not need you.  But come here once, and you will realize that it's more about you needing Med. Caf', not the other way around.The food is amazing, and they have something to keep you fed at every-single-price-point:SSB Combo:On a diet,  running low on funds, or just killing time 'til a big dinner later?  The soup, salad and bread combo can be had for less than most things from the S'bucks next door, and will keep your motor running for at least a few more hours.Plates:Hungry out of your mind and looking for a lot of savory protein, creamy carbs, and a bit of crisp clean fiber?The Akin's, Shawarma or Hummus plates all feature their absolutely delicious gyro meat (or optional chicken), creamy rice, and a very appetite-whetting salad.Apricot Chicken:But the crème de la crème in my opinion?  Once a week, when the stars align, the delightful Apricot Chicken may be had.  It's a lasagna-looking item that is very creamy, and runs slighty sweet.  For comparison, the apricot flavor it's somewhat reminiscent of a fine mango chutney.  This dish is _only_ available on Thursdays (Tuesdays need not apply!), and unlike most of their other dishes, will sell out damn fast.  From first-hand experience, if you try to go later on a Thursday, you've basically waited a full week to _not_ eat this dish.Atmosphere:As the 80's motif is strong with this one (not to mention you will end up bussing your own table), I generally prefer to take my order to-go, and walk across to the next-door Starbucks, grab a coffee there, and sit on the rooftop balcony and enjoy my food/coffee/view there.  A further walk puts you at the memorial library courtyard, which also has ample seating.In short:  Bring Cash, and don't let looks deceive you, this place is an awesomely delicious alternative to starving!I tend to avoid eating at State St. establishments, but "Med Cafe," as my friends affectionately call it, is the first State St. establishment that has made me really regret this. Let this be some valuable and vague lesson in life on never giving up. Prices are reasonable, plates are nicely portioned, food is fast, and everything is really good, like catered food good. If I'm ever a few blocks from State St. and it's feeding time, you can be sure I'm there. I don't like carrying cash, but I'll start doing it now. Med Cafe, you've changed me. *shakes fist*Who reads reviews for Med Cafe? Go here and eat their food. Seriously. Go here and eat their food. Now. Take it to the Memorial Union with a book. Or a friend. This is a real restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious. For every time I see someone in a chain restaurant with the same play school aesthetic, I think about how Med Cafe utterly kills it. Their food is so fucking good. If you hang out with someone that would prefer Einstein Bagels over Med Cafe, stop hanging out with that person. That person cheats in Monopoly. That person takes your beer without asking. That person would attempt to steal your girlfriend but can't because ladies aren't property. That person will take you to Olive Garden for your birthday. And that person will also be late and regift you a shitty used present.And it'll be your fault because you knew that person didn't like Med Cafe.
Rita's Mexican Food=I wan't sure about this place when we first arrived as it is just off the freeway and shares a parking lot with a Mexican auto / tire shop.  However, when you step inside, this little gem looks like it belongs in Old Town Scottsdale.I made a mistake and order my old standby, shredded beef tacos.  Don't get me wrong, they were okay, but nothing like my GF's order.  She order the steak fajitas which were amazing!  In fact, these are by far the best fajitas either one of us has ever experienced.  They came with all the usual suspects, however they are of the highest quality.I want to go back and try more items on the menu, but I am definetly ordering the steak fajitas next time!!!If you like fajitas, you must try Rita's!
Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles=For a long time I dreamed of going to Lo-Lo's.  I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.Finding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  "Lo-Lo's this way!"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.Entering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few "rooms" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  The Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was "ok".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.Service: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that "I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. Atmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be "afraid" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.Overall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking "wow, is that all?" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about.What can I say that has not been said already.This place is a Foodie's version of Crack!I was half way home when I wanted to turn around and go get me some more!OMG! It was just so delicious!! Starting with the giant mason jar of the coldest Ice Tea I've ever had and it was perfectly brewed not too strong or bitter. I got the unsweetened.I ordered a chicken breast with a waffle and a side of mac and cheeseEverything arrived steaming hot, even the syrup! I Love that!My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball, The chicken was so crispy and flavorful, not too spicy or salty but just right, it wasn't even greasy.My Husband got the same with a side of cheesy eggs, He was lickin' his fingers and bobbin' his head.....so what does that tell ya!All in all it was the best we've ever had, We Will be Going back!After the withdrawals wore I off I slipped into a complete food coma and slept the whole way home!There are few places that I return to where I consistently eat as much as I can and then walk outside and dry heave (really the other only places are all-you-can-eat sushi joints).  LoLo's is good, very good, but not great.  The fried chicken is good; the skin is delicious.  The scrambled eggs w/ cheese and onions are amazing, but the waffles are just all right.  The people I go with tell me that the grits are fantastic, however grits don't do it for me.  The amount of butter, cheese, and fried goodness is probably enough to actually kill a small child, and certainly enough to send anyone and everyone into a food coma.  Of course you can get smaller portions than the 'K.K.' (3 pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, eggs, and grits), but why?!  They also serve Kool-Aid and sweet tea, but they're pretty much just liquid sugar (try half sweet tea, half regular).  And the "homemade" lemonade is definitely just made from those powder lemonade mixes.  There's usually a line, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes, and the service ain't great, but that hasn't really ever bothered me (I'm usually too excited for the chicken & waffles to let something like crappy service bother me).  All-in-all, it's a great place, especially if you're able to take a siesta afterwards (i.e., close the door to your office and pass out for an hour).  But I can't say it's better than Roscoe's in LA; I mean, come on, Roscoe's puts cinnamon in its waffle batter, so good .....I woke up an hour later in the passenger seat of my own car, my window plastered with puckerings of chicken-greased flavored lipstick. Apparently, we had met up with Erica O for lunch at Lo Lo's. We drank sweet tea out of Mason jars. The menu had items named after characters from Spike Lee films. There was a "Toy Toy" and a "Betty Boop" in 'Crooklyn' right? I could swear there was a Sha Nay Nay in there somewhere.I was told I had ordered fried chicken smothered in mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Smothered. As in "served as one entity". According to Misty S, I tried fruitlessly to eat the aforementioned mad creation with a fork and knife, to try and give our lunch companion Erica O the impression that I was not, in fact, a gluttonous fatty without dignity, as my mashed potato-flavored chicken was trying to suggest.I had mentioned, before passing out in the car, that I found the waffles to be fluffy bundles of cinnamon joy. And that they tasted just fine without syrup, which was good, because I ended up getting most of my syrup on the damned fried chicki-mashed potatoes.They had offered us dessert afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. If I had just eaten two syrup-less waffles and fried chicken soaked in mashed potatoes and covered in mis-aimed maple syrup, the last thing I'd expect is to be offered red velvet cake. But I'm sure at the time the idea seemed much more reasonable.The food couldn't have been that bad, for though it gave me a "food coma" as the natives call it, I didn't suffer any intestinal woes.The story sounded so fantastic and sensational I almost didn't believe. Surely I would've remembered dining in such a wonderland of soul food stereotypes. I was tempted to call Erica O and cross-reference Misty S' account with one of her own, but we were in the parking lot of Arrowhead mall and I needed a new pair of shoes. Or two.The first thing that I saw, when I walked up to put my name on the list to be seated, were a bunch of white people and an Asian guy.  The girls taking down names were Latinas.  The first thought that popped into my head was "Where all the soul brothas and sistas at?!?"  You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?But, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.  So not cool, when it's already 100 degrees at 10am.  Can you see me sweating?  Not pretty.After a 35 minute wait, we were quickly shuffled into the a cramped little room.  Our orders were quickly taken.  Not even ten minutes later, the food arrived.  My "Toy-Toy" (two fried wings with a waffle) was delish!!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy in the middle.  Finger lickin goodness.  The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.  Despite the crampedness (is that even a word?) of the place, I'm still giving it a full 5-stars.  It's worth the wait and worth being up close and personal with your tableside neighbor.  Customer service quick and friendly.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall place, but that's what makes it even more authentic.  It's unique, has a great vibe and great food.  Next time, I'm making room for some of the red velvet cake.Straight up... I talk too much.I don't mean to... I just do but it might have been a good thing during my maiden voyage to Lo-Lo's. I met fellow yelper Kerstin ordered a two piece chicken with a waffle. I also ordered a side order of Mac & Cheese. I also ordered the Red Kool-Aid which came promptly in a jelly jar! SWEET! I was so excited! :)Then we ordered and waited... and waited... and WAITED.. and of course - I talked... and talked... and TALKED!!At first they said it would be a few minutes... and then they said that they were going to be making more chicken for us and promised it would be worth it. I put my faith in all the other great yelpers who loved this place that it would be in fact - worth it. So we waited some more - the waitress even offered a waffle as an appetizer. (yay!)My first taste of Lo-lo's was... PERFECT! I never had a fresh waffle except for that one time at the Windmil Hotel & that waffle was rubbery! But... Lo-lo's was nothing like that rubbery shoe tread! It was light, crisp, and amazing with it's sweet cinnamon goodness. I loved it! :) I'm now worried that Lo-lo's has ruined me for all the other waffles in my future.And then we waited some more and I talked some more... and then FINALLY our food came... well - most of it. I didn't notice it until I started to dig in to my own food that Kerstin's meal didn't come at first! She had to wait a few minutes for her meal - I felt bad, as I stuffed my face with my crispy fried chicken wing. Which was good, but great? Ummmm... Yeah, I guess it was. It was better than most but it was a little on the dry side. Honestly, it wasn't worth the wait. I could've been home with a bucket of the Colonal's finest 11 herbs and spices in the time it took for them to get our food out! The mixing of the flavors, of the chicken and the sweetness of the waffles was spectactular! Now this is where Lo-lo's shines! The chicken by itself? Meh... The waffles by itself? oooo... together? WHOA! I loved it! :)But I couldn't even begin to eat it all!! There was so much food! I also sampled Kerstin's Catfish which was WAAY yummy! :) So was her green bean & potato side dish. it was hot and spicy and really good with some salt.Overall, I loved the decor, especially the signed autographs on the walls - crazy kewl. The drinks served in mason jars. Even the color of the walls. I dug that the servers tried... but dude - it took us a few times of reminding them of my mac & cheese before it hit the table... WAAAAAY after we each started our dinner. (boo!) And even then - it was sticky and luke warm and lacked... soul. There I said it... a soul resturant's food lacked soul. For real.I'll totally go back, but not with as much enthusiasm as i did the first time, but seriously - the first time is rarely the best time... so here's hoping for better in my Lo-lo's future.I've tried dining here twice.  The first time I visited, the resto was so packed, I waited ten minutes and then left.  The second time, debated on leaving, but stayed.  Had fried chicken, a waffle, cornbread, and the candied yams.  Best thing were the yams!  Chicken was alright.  Waffle was too thin, light in color, and soggy.  It didn't help to witness one of the staff sneaking in the back with a bag of Bisquick while I was waiting for a table.  I thought the waffles and batter were homemade??  Cornbread didn't even compare to Redfish or Z'Tejas!  Honestly, it tasted like the dried versions I tried at Big City BBQ and Marie Callender's... Tsk, tsk.If I were to return, it would only be for the candied yams/sweet potatoes.  Those deserved 5 stars!Can you say "food coma?"OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the "Nay Nay's" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!  I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!Pretty much the most amazing chicken and waffle experience I've ever had.I went to LoLo's with Robert and Bacon on a Sunday morning. We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1/2 sweet and 1/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra. I was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah.... We were checked on several times to see if we needed anything and we were treated cordially. I will visit LoLo's any time, any day as long as someone is there to share the guilt with me!First off, let me just say that this is my first yelp.  Go easy on me.Visualize yourself shitfaced at the end of the night, stopping for a bucket of KFC because nothing could ever taste better than food when you're that drunk.  You with me?  LoLo's is that good, only sober, and in the morning.  Show up there at 955am on a Sunday and you'll see a line of brothas in their sunday best waiting to get in to this place.  And where that line of people goes, I will blindly follow.Because inside you'll find: mason jars (!) of red Kool-Aid, good ol' fashioned Southern sweet tea, or whatever soda you want.  But then there's the plate of fried chicken.  Top it off with red rooster sauce and life is damn good.Alternatives: mac and cheeseThe waffles are good but to be honest with you, I feel like they just get in the way of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  (Sober or drunk)  I mean, you wouldn't just go to the original pancake house and get only eggs and hash browns, would you?  Only a goddamn fool would do that.  No, you are the person that goes to Mastro's for the steak, Sapporo for the teppan yaki, and Red Lobster for the, well, red lobster.  (you know what I mean...)  And since you are that person, go to LoLo's.  Get a jar of drink and eat so much chicken that you want to die.  It's a good feeling.Oh. My. God.How have I never been to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles after 8 years in the Valley? Shame on all of my friends for waiting so long to take me to this hidden gem!!Think fried chicken with your breakfast of waffles, eggs, and cheese grits sounds gross?  Well you have never been more wrong my friend!I don't quite know how, but it was oh so right.  And I am not a big meat with my eggs fan (i.e. steak and eggs) fan in general so no one was more surprised than me when I was left craving some more of that delicious fried perfection after Brad E was kind enough to share some of his with me.The waffles are dusted with cinnamon and melt in your mouth.  The cheese grits are wonderfully authentic to a southern girl such as myself, and let's be honest, who in their right mind would ever complain about a freakin' Mason Jar filled to the brim with delicious kool-aid.I ordered WAY too much food for myself (shocker) so I didn't even get to sample the mac and cheese, corn, and other incredibly enticing side dishes that were scattered about my table.Yes, the place is kind of cramped and you'll wait longer than you want for your food, but deal with it, you'll be thrilled you did.It's easy to like the things that everybody else likes. It's human nature to want to be loved and to want to be accepted. Deep in our DNA, we are still pack animals (as in "a scrum of rugby's", as opposed to pack animals as in "pack all that crap on that animals back and let's go").My sense of needing to belong was what brought me to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles a few years ago, and my sense of "I haven't had a decent chicken and waffles fix for a while" brought me back today!You won't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken...I won't fawn over whoever is in the kitchen turning out delicious waffle after delicious waffle.I can't sit here all afternoon and go on and on about the many delectable sides like the buttery and cheesy grits, the melt in your mouth fried okra, and the gallons and gallons of sweet tea or homemade lemonade that you can consume with your lunch at Lolo's.It's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards, and fish and grits, that you just can't get other places that stir my soul.I'm not moved to hyperbole (pronounced "high-per-bowl":) by the blending of sweet maple syrup, buttered waffles and savory fried chicken on the plate.I am not reduced to tears by some of the best red velvet cake to come out of an oven in the greater Phoenix Area.No, it's the people at Lolo's that make me go back, and the sense of belonging and of being one of the Lolo's "pack"...that and some of the best fried chicken, waffles, grits and cake that you will ever eat.Go to Lolo's...you're family, you should drop by once in a while:)I'm pullin' an Al Bundy on the couch after dining at LoLo's.  You know - he sits on the couch, slouched with his hand down the front of his pants to give more room to his gut.  That's me right now, only with WAY better hair.Had the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes.The platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long.Nathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.  Collard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.  I'm full.  Not Thanksgiving-dinner full, but properly sated after a meal at LoLo's.  The company rocked and I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant dinner crowd!  (p.s. We pegged Whoopie to play Julia.  Ha!)I have a one track mind, I can't be saved, Lo-Lo's is all I craveI know I have to face it -- I'm addicted to Lo-Lo'sFrom the crispy fried chicken, the waffles that melt in your mouth, the attentive service with a warm welcoming smile. I just can't get enough.I know I have to face it -- I'm addicted to Lo-Lo's*yay!* this is my 200th review!!!!Ok, so I wanted to do something special for my 200th review, so I took myself to LoLo's chicken and waffles for lunch today.  I had really high expectations, but left kind of feeling a little let down.  I got there, and sitting outside the front door was some girl who I guess was the hostess.  She asked me how many and I told her it was just me. I felt kind of awkward.  She showed me inside and asked if I wanted to sit at this crammed little bar facing basically a freaking wall.  I asked to be seated somewhere else, as it was really uncomfortable to sit there.  So, she sat me in another room near the kitchen area.  Did this place used to be a house or something?  It had to have been.  It feels like theres a zillon different little rooms with tables.  Anyways, so I finally got sat at a real table.  Mazel Tov.   A girl took my drink order, but the service was slow to order. I waited and waited and finally a server came and took my order. I went for the 2 chicken legs and a waffle.  Service actually kinda sucked, but I'm willing to let it go.  I won't hold it against them since everyone seems to like it so much.So, they bring out my food.  I guess it was okay, but not the greatest food Ive sunk my teeth into. I surprisingly was full when I finished.  the chicken was good, but I think the waffles is what got me.  It came with a nice amount of butter, which I smeared all over the waffle, and then drowned it in syrup. I liked it!  Thier butter really made a difference.While I was eating, I was happy to see 2 autographs of the Harlem Globetrotters players on the wall, both of which I obviously know.  Impressive!Needless to say, I guess I was expecting more.  Service was spotty, unimpressive, and actually kind of sucked.  Food was decent, but not earth shattering.  I will probably return, but probably not for some time.OM Heavenly G!!!  Who knew fried chicken and waffles went so well together!!!  My daughter was in heaven!!  She loved her chicken and she doesn't eat much meat at all but the crispy fried chicken had her knawing on the bone.  I ate my entire plate and so did my daughter.  And she has been asking to go back ever since.  And the sweet tea....YUM!!  It was just right, not overly sweet.  I don't know that a place like this exists anywhere in the Northern CA/Bay Area but someone should open one!  For now this is one reason I'm glad I live in Phoenix.....I will be a frequent customer.  The inside feels like you walked into someone's house and I never would have known it was there since it's in a non descript part of town...kind of industrial.  We got there pretty early and by the time we left, the place was packed!  I have been craving this chicken since we went there...I know we will be back!!!  And often!Props to Flow Rida:Jim W had the Fried Chicken [Chicken]Cornbread on the side [On the Side]The whole plate was lookin at meI  hit the food  [He hit the food]Next thing you knowJim W gonna be back to  lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo Them plates full of foodAnd the Waffles with the syrup [With the syrup]I turned around and gave that big helping a go [Hey!]I hit the food [He hit the food]Next thing you knowJimmy ate at lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo  I ain't never ate nuthin that made me say Yo,this crazy good food for not a lot of doughMight have a million calories but that's alright ya' know,Them waffle cakes, they win place and showSo tasty, it was consumableProfessional, flavor incredible Awesome fried chicken [Chicken]Sides I must concur [Must Concur]This food could give the food scene a stirI  hit the food  [He hit the food]Next thing you knowJim W gonna be back to  lo-lo lo-lo lo-lo lo-loWell I finally ventured to the south side to try out Lo Lo's. Let me start by saying it ain't Roscoe's. I still prefer Roscoe's fried chicken. I think this is a better to go spot than a dine in. The restaurant is very cramped if you are claustrophobic don't dine in, this place is smaller than Matt's BB! I mean you gotta go outside to change your mind. I had to take off a star for the cramped quarters. Then I had to take off another star because it was hotter than hell in there! I was sweating like a sinner in church! Did they even have air? That is not cool literally! I like that they use mason jars to serve the drinks. But they were even sweating before the drinks got to the table that's how hot it was! The staff was very friendly but we had 6 different people come to our table?? We didn't know who our server was. One person came and took a drink order another person delivered it. Then a third person asked if we were ready to order. Then a fourth asked for our order we gave it. Then we had a 5th person who brought the food, and a 6th that we paid the bill with?? What the hell was that about we didn't know who to tip. We also had to sit for what seemed like an eternity on the sun to get our bill paid. For as small as Lo Lo's is they have to many people running around there not a very good use of funds if you ask me. They have about a dozen tables there and I counted 9 people working the floor. That's crazy. Now on to the food, I order fried chicken, smothered potatoes, and buttered corn. I had to laugh when a girl across the room wanted to order grilled chicken and asked what are the potatoes smothered with. This is southern cooking, soul food. It is smothered in gravy! Duh. I thought the chicken was very good and large pieces too. The smothered potatoes were very good just needed a little salt. The buttered corn was right on point. My friend got the catfish and chips. The catfish was good I still prefer Honey Bears Cat! The fries were good too! All in all I think Lo Lo's is A-ok, It would rate better if the restaurant was set up differently and they would use the air conditioner!Wasn't really what I expected, eating at Lo-Lo's. But, I should share that I am not a huge fan of fried chicken to begin with. That said, I can now cross "Eat at Lo-Lo's" off my "things to do at least once" list. Dottsy described the chicken perfectly. It was not greasy nor soggy. I did not find it especially flavorful but did pick up on the baking soda. I was expecting a much denser waffle but found it to be thin and limp. The mac and cheese was super creamy and had hints of cream of mushroom soup. Nothing was really memorable for me, except the collard greens. For some reason, that's the flavor that remains most vivid. They had a delicious healthy greens flavor with a nice chili flake kick. So, Lo-Lo's didn't knock my socks off but Lo-Lo's isn't really for me. It's for people who love fried chicken... so, if that's you, I suggest you not miss this place! You'll probably really like it!!Lo-Lo's is rigoddamndiculous. If you don't like this place there is something absolutely wrong with you.Came here for #smunch this past Saturday morning with some of Phoenix' finest ... and I am positive no one was disappointed.. I got the Betty Boop which consisted of a juicy breast of chicken and a large, butter soaked waffle with hints of cinnamon.. when I say butter soaked, I am not even exaggerating. Delicious! Being the fat kid that I am, I also ordered a side of smothered potatoes, ie: roasted taters drenched in their homemade gravy. FYES! FTW! I also got Kool-aid. In a mason jar. Why did I ever stop drinking the stuff? I don't know. Memories of childhood immediately flooded my mind along with a 5 hour long sugar high. I probably gained 5 pounds, but whatever.. This food takes you into instant Utopia, followed by an instant food coma. I think we had about 5 different servers as well, but how can you complain about that? They were on top of their game!Do not come here if you are trying to eat healthy or have issues with cholesterol and/or get annoyed with really loud drunk/hungover people (depending on the time of day you come, sometimes they're open till 3am). Oh, and don't even worry about the location, safe no, sketch yes, worth it, absolutely. AmazingaZING!I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has "Chicken & Waffles" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.Damn.I've had fried chicken.I've had waffles.Who knew that they were really meant to be Together, on the Same Plate!?  Not me, at least until I was introduced to Lo-Lo's.  The Pilgrimage to this wee building on a small side street in downtown PHX was made on a cold, rainy Sunday - perfect weather for comfort food! After strategic review of the menu consisting of a price volume mix analysis to determine the right combination of entrees and side items to reach Pareto Optimality, my friend and I ended up with a table full of goodness:Lo-Lo plate (2 waffles + 3 chicken breasts), 1 additional waffle, home fries and (no surprise here) mac n cheese.  The food arrived quickly (benefit of arriving right at opening time!), and this is where all conversation stopped.  No talking, just eating and lots of it.  I surfaced for air once or twice to mumble random things about how good everything was, but that's about it.  I don't know how the Lo-Lo's Chicken Magicians manage to make fried chicken that is not greasy - it is crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside.  The waffles taste slightly of cinnamon and I am not ashamed that I used the entire portion of butter that was riding on the top.  All of it.  Hard arteries are strong arteries, right?  Halfway through the mac n cheese I noticed the Red Rooster Louisiana Hot Sauce on the table - liquid fire!  Had to douse the remaining portion and feel the burn...  Yeah!!OK Phoenix, I get it.  I know now what I have been missing all this time.  I will be back in about 4 months, when my cholesterol levels return to normal...  :)Fried Chicken, Mac and Cheese, Red Velvet Cake and Kool-Aid!Now that's my kind of breakfast. Lolo's Chicken and Waffles is a small joint located in a not so lovely residential area of Phoenix . Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome! My fiancé and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiancé and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid. The service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too. If you like Soul Food and happen to be in the Phoenix area then you have to check out Lolo's. This place rocks!I lived in LA for 4 years and ate at Roscoe's a lot. Lo-lo's is better by FAR.Why? One word: gravy. The chicken is tender, juicy, and fried to perfection here. Not overly greasy. The waffles? Just perfect waffles with lots of flavor. The grits? Buttery. The Eggs? Tastes like crack when its scrambled with onions. The drinks/kool-aid? Ridiculous size. The gravy?RIDICULOUS. Getting the gravy on the side is the best decision you'll ever make. Unlike Roscoe's, which pairs regular brown gravy, Lo-lo's pairs some sort of spiced and onioned concoction that reminds me of the drippings gravy you make on Turkey Day. I literally dipped my entire meal (waffles, grits, eggs) in this gravy and still couldn't get enough.My only grip is that the Lo-lo's in Scottsdale takes amex, but this one doesn't. =(.But seriously, Lo-lo's....could eat it every day. IN fact, we we're here for one week, and at Lo-lo's twice.Oh yeah, the Red Velvet cake is RIDICULOUS.During a recent road trip, a chef friend sent me a link to www.roadfood.com so I could try some interesting eateries along the drive from Green Valley to Goodyear. The site suggested Lo-Lo's, and Yelpers agreed. We didn't have to make a major detour off the freeway.We parked on the street and entered a modest restaurant with bars on the window. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=KUUUNkwR7yzcX2o38AYTQQ No biggie. We received a warm welcome and got friendly service.We ordered:* 2 waffles with 3 pieces of chicken - I liked the waffles a lot. I still am not sure I "get" chicken with waffles, but I'm testing it out. I liked the chicken, but wasn't completely blown away by it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=3fY_2vL-zR4xXiKuhDjRgA* 1 plain waffle for our 5-year-old - Thumbs up from the kid.* Grits - Lumpy and plain, but still nice in a simple carb sort of way. As a California girl, I know almost nothing about grits.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=UP5-xhOoSN3C3JLURcrXJA* Chili and corn muffin - The chili was made with beans and beef, and was delicious. The corn muffin seemed pretty dry - waffles are way better here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=PojMqwuCAdilemZILlH1AA* Mac n' cheese - Creamy and satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=apV6OcH9iItBhrm8An33nw* Collard greens - Spicy, the flavor seemed a bit muddled, but it was a-okay. * Red velvet cake - This was one of the best RV cakes I've tried. Incredibly moist (how did they do it?), very sweet, with fresh pecans on the frosting. I recommend ordering a slice to go, since you'll likely be to full to enjoy it after eating all this heavy food. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=l12Isv2RMc5q0LRuYmD4wAI was glad to have found this special soul food restaurant. We left feeling totally stuffed and very impressed.Oh, Lo-Lo's how I love thee...  I catered Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles for a surprise Halloween lunch for my staff this week and it was a huge hit.  I just told them I was catering lunch in, I didn't tell who was bringing the food.  After the food was set up and ready to go I emailed the staff and told them the food was ready and that it was Lo-Lo's.  You should have seen the steady stream of employees that started 'prairie dogging' over their cubicle walls and letting each other know what the big, surprise lunch announcement was!  It was hilarious how fast they scooted their normally slow asses to the conference room to be the first in line for Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles!!Lo-Lo himself (Larry) came out and he made piping hot, fresh waffles to order as the employees all dined on the best fried chicken in all of Arizona, and some of the most delicious mac and cheese and read beans and rice I've ever tasted.    Ohmidog, their food is so damn good...I was the office hero for the day and I couldn't have done with without Lo-Lo's.  Thank you, Larry!  You want to be the most popular person in your office?  Cater Lo-Lo's for your staff for lunch.  You will NOT be disappointed in the results.  ;)This review breaks my heart. A few friends and I met up at the down town location, I was excited to see that the newly renovated and expanded LoLo's was now open for business! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! That's about where the love ends with this review sadly. We were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did. When we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI. Next up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh? My food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that? Ive been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves. Not cool Lolo's, not cool at all. I think its rad that you expanded, but if you cant handle the customer load then whats the point?BLUFGot it to go and glad I did. The chicken was OK but only for the first couple of bites.  The red velvet cake was aweful. BackgroundYelpers let me down on this one.  I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake.  Let me say I didn't have to watch the scale worried of well earned weight gain from this meal.  The chicken was an initial hit but was short lived.  I didn't finish it nor did I want to.  The waffle did not travel well either, it was soggy by arrival (10 mins to the hotel - arrgh!)  nor was it flavored in any manor. I would liken it to the generic bread slices used at other joints for sopping up the grease.  The red velvet was a crime.  It too lacked flavor, was heavy beyond understanding and it hurts me to say this - was only deserving of the trash. wa, wa, waaaa.$20+ for soul food that was so bad.This review should be read aloud in the voice of my dad, which means a combination of Foghorn Leghorn and Tommy Lee Jones.Q: do you like fried chicken? If you answered "yes" proceed to Lo-Lo's. If you answered "no",  then what in the hell is wrong with you? Seriously, go get a chicken leg from anywhere else that sells chicken legs. Go on. I'll wait.Now, look at the chicken leg that you just brought over here to me and compare it to...THIS BIG-ASS MONSTROUS LEG FROM A REAL CHICKEN THAT THEY ARE GONNA SERVE YOU AT LO-LO's!Not only is this leg three times bigger than that lil ole scrawny bantam leg you got, but it's ten times as juicy and tastes like the good Lord done blessed whatever chicken it came from with the most delicious chicken genes he could find! Chicken so good you'll wanna take the bones home with you and suck on 'em later just to reminisce about how good that chicken was.Don't let the rating fool you, the food is great. I have only eaten at the Scottsdale location but my comment is for the Central location.My mom and I went in there this evening after having lunch at the Scottsdale location. We stopped in because the Scottsdale location had run out of banana pudding and i was craving it. I called ahead to make sure the Central location had not run out as well. I told the hostess on the phone that I was heading in to get some "To Go". Upon arrival we walked in and advised the hostess that we wished to place a dessert order to go. She promptly replied that they are NOT DOING ANY TO GO ORDERS!! HUH??? I advised the hostess that my mom and I only wanted banana pudding and a slice of red velvet cake, plus had called just 10 minutes prior. Again she reminded me that they had been advised by management that there would be no to go orders because they "Backed up" the kitchen and delayed orders. Even for dessert that takes 2 minutes???? It would seem to me that if you do not have enough staff to fully run your business then you should probably look into hiring another cook!!! But I must have mistaken the establishment for a restaurant, silly me! After checking with management the hostess returned and reluctantly took my order. I asked my mom if she wanted the Red Velvet cake or the Soc it to me cake. The hostess interrupted to advise me that they didnt have that there. I reminded her that the sign outside stated that it was one of the specials today!! It took longer for the hostess to take my money and give receipt than it took to get my order packaged to go.I love Lo-Lo's. My family and I eat at the Scottsdale location 3 times a month. We get the best service there. I have been to the location on Central twice and twice they have failed to provide any service even close to the service in Scottsdale. I am uncertain if it is the location and blatant disregard for customers or a Management issue. Either way, I will not be returning to the Central location. I live in Central Phoenix and would still rather drive to Scottsdale where my money and patronage are appreciated.This was the second place I requested to go on our trip to Arizona. My boyfriend isn't as into Soul Food as I am, but he ended up loving it as much as I did! We arrived around 11:45 on Saturday morning and there was a short wait to be seated.Once seated everything happened very fast. Everybody who works here is very friendly and we were constantly checked on. We both ordered a "jar of drank," Sweet Tea. It was really good. I could taste lots of honey in it. Yum! They also offer to go cups so I was able to take it with me when we left.My boyfriend ordered Nay Nay's breakfast, two waffles, two eggs, and a bowl of grits. His waffles were delicious, loaded with cinnamon. Loved those. I usually don't like grits, but they were good here. There was so much butter on them, I don't know how somebody couldn't like them!I went with the Lolo's Famous Soul Food Platter, and I chose three pieces of fried chicken, mac & cheese, and smothered potatoes. This platter is also served with a piece of cornbread. I knew it would be way too much food, but I wanted to try it all. Everything was perfect! The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great, chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions. And the cornbread was great too, very sweet.The restaurant is bright and airy and they played awesome music the entire time we were here. The bathroom was very clean. The outdoor patio area was really cute. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! We were both really glad we stopped by here for lunch, we left full and happy. I am sure we will come here again whenever we visit Arizona.By far the best place for some chicken and waffles with a nice tall mason jar full of red Kool-Aid!While some may say the location isn't the best [okay, it can seem pretty sketchy after dusk], the food is amazing!  I usually get the Betty's Boob[a waffle and a breast] and some mac & cheese if I'm feeling extra hungry.  The waffle is always crisp and delicious and the fried chicken is delicious.  Gotta love that savory-sweet combo of a syrup-y bite of waffle with a juicy bite of chicken.  *shivers*The service is always friendly and this place is usually packed. Lo-Lo's definitely lives up to all their hype [don't go to the Scottsdale location though.  Totes not the same.]~!4.5 stars! To borrow a phrase from George Takei, oh my! We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  Our waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. The fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.The main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.The chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  Throughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.To finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.My hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory. I'm fairly certain I ate the equivalent of two days caloric intake. with a smile on my face, I thought dreamily of the Tums sitting on my nightstand at home.Ok.. So I had to call one of my African American friends and ask him "What the HELL is so goddam special about Lo-Los?!!" To which he Literally laughed out loud and said "NOTHING!!"I knew he would have been and have some type of input. He had, and he did. No! I am not racist or stereotyping anyone! I know he loves Fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion.  He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me "you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation." This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.  Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets. The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry. It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it. This place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING. I recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices.For the longest time I put off eating Lo-Lo's because I'm a faithful one to Roscoe's, however sometimes the smell of fried chicken and freshly made waffles are too hard to resist. Just know ahead of time that Lo-Lo's is definitely going to put you to sleep- literally and figuratively!I had to do it the right way and get the obligatory Chicken & Waffles- "Tre-tre" which is two drumsticks and a waffle ... and a sweet tea to drink. Amazingly fried chicken with hot sauce is pure gluttonous heaven, followed with the sweet and crisp waffle. The sweet tea is so, so good it's refreshing and sweet! Also you get it in a large mouth mason jar that is enough for two people!Service is a bit slow, but reasonable for the amount of people dining in and parking may be a bit problematic. Once you step out of your car the smell of waffles wafting in the air will resolve some of that stress- trust.I'm going to say what I tell everyone about having chicken & waffles ... it is one glorious meal, then you feel like garbage afterwards- but it's totally worth it! Speaking of which, chicken and waffles sound really good about now.O:^)Very cute spot customer service is awesome the sweet tea is good we got the catfish  and chicken and waffles. Get of the freeway 10 west 7th Street  lots of parking  and they have take outFor our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some Southern cooking and comfort food so we decided to give this place a try.  We came hungry and left happy!Location & Aesthetics - located on S Central Ave in Phoenix.  It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.  The parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.The restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on.The restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.  Noise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars.My suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left.There's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.  If you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.Menus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated.When you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).  Service - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.  The waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.Food - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans.The wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through.For my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.  The rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it.The chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily/greasy It was truly Southern styled, comfort food!Definitely would love to come back to try those oversized Belgium waffles I was seeing on other folks plates!  You truly won't regret your visit here!
Liyuen=This place is straight up hood.I turned down the street and a dog was just running around. my heart broke for that dog for the rest of the night :( I wanted to take him home, clean him up and give him to someone for christmas. I see this graffiti covered building. only, not really a building because there wasn't a door. just a tiny window. not just any window, but a bullet proof one. with prison bars on the outside? ummmm.......the back doubled as a junk yard. vacuum? check. gnome? check. stray dog? random couch? check. check.my friend shouts- this is it!!!! here it is!!! I'm so excited!!! uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh there were a lot of people hanging by this 'window', they were perhaps homeless?? convicts? i don't know.but this place works like this: walk up to the window, place your order, and wait. my friend was like 'im not bringing my whole purse up there, i don't want to get pick pocketed.' so I said, 'ok, i'll bring mine. it doubles as a weapon'. and we made our way up to the window.the food was dirt cheap- we got two eggrolls, chicken fried rice, spicy chicken dinner, and 12 wontons and diet coke. we spent a total of $16.The food was A-OK and while we waited even more people came to the window. this place was hoppin.  the fried rice was the best- it was super buttery and i loooovvveee butter. the chicken was plain old breaded and fried w a glossy 'spciy' (not really at all) sauce. the fried wontons were just decent, and the eggrolls were delish. but this is not a place i would come back to. for fear of being robbed. call me angel princess, but i couldn't get over the 'ambiance' to chow down and not think twice about what type of quality meat i was eating at such cheap prices...try it if you're brave because it was definitely tasty for the price....i think....
Steep & Brew=Of all the coffee shops downtown, Steep & Brew is justifiably one of the most loved. From the subtle scent of coffee grounds, to the soft lighting, spacious tables, and cozy couches, it makes sense that snagging a spot here on a Sunday afternoon can be quite a struggle. However once you are able to settle in, you won't want to leave and there's no need to. With a menu offering customized waffles and oatmeal, and a bakery case displaying oodles of sweet and savory goodness, you can easily make Steep & Brew your home for the day. While the atmosphere and food options are an added bonus, it's the drinks that will have you coming back for more. Don't let the cost of coffee shop bevies scare you away. In addition to their almost perpetual deals on the Hooked app, Steep & Brew offers a frequent buyer punch card that'll set you on your way to a free cup in no time. As far as these drinks go, they've got the best ginger tea in town. Bold statement, I realize, considering I'm a ginger tea connoisseur these days. But Steep & Brew's version is the most ginger packed and spicy and oh so good. Tons of dried ginger goes into the making of this tea and they aren't skimpy.Steep & Brew is also home of my current favorite chai tea latte. Yep, this fragrant concoction is a staple on coffee shop menus, yet few do it right. The evolving variety of chai blends makes for an ever unique flavor trip, and it's our innate curiosity that leads us to try it at many different shops. Crafting the ideal chai, however, is a veritable art form. There is indeed a fine line between excessive sweetness and subtle sugar undertones, an unwelcome abundance of milk and a perfect level of creaminess. If there is one coffee shop that masters this balancing act, it is Steep & Brew. While chai is a black tea and already contains caffeine, if you're in the mood for an extra dose then check out their Dirty Chai. It combines the loveliness of the aforementioned chai with a robust shot of espresso to create a drink that it slightly less sweet and certainly generates an added jolt. Whether you decide to go dirty or not, the chai is a must try.*Expert tip: ask for an added Cuban shot in your chai tea latte, or any other coffee beverage for that matter, and prepare for greatness. This 'Cuban pull' refers to an espresso shot that's been sweetened with sugar during the brewing process, which allows for a nice caramelized sweetness that supplements many of Steep & Brew's drinks quite nicely. Impress your friends and order this guy with your usual cuppa.This might be my favorite on State. It's just a super chill place. I love the upstairs thing they got going on (for the most part...the back part is kind of ugly tbh), it's usually pretty low traffic, the staff are friendly, and the coffee is good. Why 4 stars?I HATE the pastry display. This might seem to be the dumbest reason to dock a star. But I'm hoping that management sees this, because I've talked to baristas about it, and they agree, and have been pushing for this to be changed themselves for a while from what they said. What's the problem with it? There's no door on the back. Why is this a problem? Fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. I would LOVE to buy a blueberry cream cheese Danish...but I can't, EVER, because flies are ALWAYS in there. YES this REQUIRES ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE. It's such a major issue, because it's not just a couple, and it's not just a couple days a week. I legitimately think there is just a colony of them living in that case. Please, someone, put a scrap of cloth over the back. Get one out of the trash and throw it in the wash and put it up - I don't care. Anything is better than nothing at all.... And then I can buy your delicious-looking pastries. :)
The Fry Bread House=So as a native Phoenician, I grew up eating fry bread. But here's the deal... the only place you could get it was at the Arizona State Fair (And believe me, my folks would actually plan ASF trips for that very purpose!) or if the Heard had some special event.What can be said of puffy little pockets of air and chewy goodness fried up in some hideously unhealthy concoction, thereby creating a crispy yum yum shell which you can top to your liking? Holy Mother of God my mouth is watering just thinking about it!The people are friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the sauce should be nominated as a sixth food group in itself... foodies unite and to hell with diets!!! The only downside to this place is that parking can be a nightmare (my sister went once and almost drove over someone napping on a parking block!) But seriously I wouldn't let that detain you from the food inside. : )Whether you are looking for something veggie to carnivore or sweet and sticky the servings are generous. So put on your big girl pants, head on over to The Fry Bread House and pull up a chair.love Love LOVE "The Fry Bread House"Ahhhh Feast Day.... They're awesome. I wish I could bring all you yelpers to my village's feast day.... it's like... christmas in the early fall except the only presants aren't left under the tree but instead are scooped by 60 year old O'odham grandmothers who have been cooking since childhood and only know unwritten recipes that lack measurement, volumetric or otherwise. I could describe to you the food we eat on San Juan's Day (in my village) or Saint Frances Day (Ak-Chin & Salt River)... but if you want a taste of what it's like to line up and part take in the ceremonial meal... head on down to the Fry Bread House.The BEST way to experience this would be to go and order a bowl red chili stew with side order of frybread and if you're interested a lil baby bowl of beans. and then just wait. Dip and scoop the bread in the stew and enjoy. There's NOTHING better than moistening the light and crispy bread into the broth of the stew. It's heaven!ok..so i had a really good friend who took me here a few times...well not here..actually when it was on Indian School and 7th st. it looks so much more inviting now. i just need to bring myself to want to gorge nom nom nom on some fry bread. it's like a big pile of fried crack. you seriously get hooked on the decadent fried morsals. topped with hot and saveries these are just to kill for. maybe even worth dying for. a sweet one is excelent..nom nom nom. ok i think i need to end this post before i eat my keyboard.I had the pleasure of visiting FBH with my fave Foodie Bear and Robert a while back. (Yeah I'm behind on reviews). All I can say is WOW. I have become a fan of FBH. We walked in to a small, clean space. You order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table! My advice, grab a table then go order. For my yummy meal I had the fry bread with beans and green chile. I was delighted to see that I could wash my guilt-ridden meal down with Big Red Cream soda...mmm.. When I bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle. It was so good. I wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce, but it still did the job. We also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread. It was so-so in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on FBH! I will certainly visit FBH again maybe after I do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days... it's just too good to eat on a regular basis!My buddy Kevin N. back in San Jose told me about the Fry Bread House. He said I had to find it and try it when i got to Phoenix.  It sounded like a place I would LOVE.  So when I got here I started looking to see if I could find it.  I drove down Indian School on several occasions, turned down 7th St.....nothin.  After several attempts and a post to Yelpers I realized that I was looking for 7th AVE and not 7th ST.  Doh!!  With that issue out of the way, I made a trip over last week and found it!!  The parking lot of pretty full.....good sign in my book, and it looked like a little house on the outside.  We walked in and picked up a menu.  I wanted to try it all but I finally narrowed it down and ordered the Hominy Stew.  My daughter had some fry bread with cheese.  We were greated warmly, ordered, got our drinks and sat down to wait.  We did not wait long for our food and out came the fry bread and the stew.  My daughter LOVED her fry bread with cheese.  That is her kind of thing.  The hominy stew was perfection!!  I love hominy and there were chunks of tender beef in a nice broth.  And a giant piece of fry bread to go with it.  I was so full when I left.  I totallly loved it.  This is a great place!!  A nice little hole in the wall that serves up big portions for small prices.  You can see the ladies in the back cooking up  a storm!  This is such a little gem of a place.  I only wish that they could take all the calories and bad things out of the fry bread....but then it wouldn't be fry bread and it wouldn't be nearly as good.  *sigh*  I can't wait to go back and try the tacos, the green and red chile, or any of the other amazing sounding things they have on the menu!!  Seriously, get to the Fry Bread house now and enjoy!!  Special thanks to Kevin N. for telling me about this wonderful little gem!!Miss you Kevin!!Hmm... I'm not sure what I was expecting from my first taste of Native American food but, my Navajo Taco from The Fry Bread House was did not live up to any ideas I had.  The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-/When I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food. So, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... I'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.  Prolly won't see ya there.I've been hearing about fry bread house for awhile now. So when I moved into my new home and found it right next door to my neighborhood dive bar, which does not serve food, I was understandably excited.  You know what you need whilst drinking cheap beer? greasy food.  This isn't greasy bad, like dripping and wet, this is good.  This is fluffy warm fry bread, with delicious spicy chorrizo, and all the fixings.The prices are good, the staff was friendly and quick, and the food? oh yes, I  will be back.Also, the leftovers with a fried egg cracked on top, a great breakfast the next morning.  really.
Great Wall Cuisine=After having eaten at Golden Buddha, China King, C-Fu, and China Chan, I have to say that Great Wall is probably the best place to get dimsum in the Valley.   China Chan comes a close second with better har gau and egg tarts.The Chinese New Year special dimsum - pig trotters with black moss - was delicious.  Apparently it's super labor intensive so is only offered for a limited time.  The shiu mai, steamed tripe and spare ribs were cooked and seasoned just right.  The taro puff had great taro flavor and tasty filling with only a hint of oil.The har gau skin unfortunately fell apart and the egg tart crust was not as flaky as China Chan's.  Overall, the flavors were good, fresh and a nice variety to choose from.Ever since I started getting daily e-mails from my bureaucratic overlords reminding me of the impending layoffs, unpaid furloughs and "department consolidations" I have to look forward to, I've been cutting back on going out and actually enjoying myself. Mostly because they cut all my hours and I still need to find a way to pay my therapist.So for the last week or so it's (haha, proper use of the apostrophe, bitches) been ramen noodles, rice, ramen noodles, peanut butter, and ramen noodles. I've been trying to make the most of it. I look up ramen recipes on the internet. I make aesthetically pleasing bentos out of them. I even put pictures of my lunch on my livejournal, perhaps to maintain the illusion that I'm "challenging myself" rather than desperately clinging to the edge of poverty.Alas, no how I try to psyche myself, there is no pick me up for the buzz kill one experiences when eating 15 cent noodles in front of your computer when your stomach and smug sense of culture are screaming for something...more...Like dim sum. Like Great Wall's dim sum.This morning I was stewing another batch of "failure food" when the insane craving for dim sum hit me like homosexual tendencies striking a fundamentalist preacher giving a sermon on how G*d hates Rastafarians.On the outside, Great Wall looks like another two-bit strip mall attraction. You know, like all the stores next to it. But inside it's like the dining room of Hotel Awesome, where somewhat discontent-looking servers push around carts of delicious and deliver plates of FUCK YEAH to your table where you and your party can divvy them up/fight over them. Whatever fits your interpretation of Darwinism.To be honest I'm surprised more people don't fight over the food.For a mound of their delicious lo mein I would probably break a chair over someone's face. For a plate of their pork buns I would falcon punch someone in front of their kids.This may seem a little aggressive...but it can be a fucking battle royale in there.Especially when you don't have anyone in your party who speaks the language."Uh, yes, I'll take some of that, no, that, yes the thing with the shrimp in it. Oh, and some of that, too. No. To the right. Yes. Oh shit, where'd our ticket go?"I remember watching a Muppet Babies episode once where the children were eating gruel or something and they suggested trying to imagine it as something tastier.I tried that. It's a lot harder than it looks.You swirl those nickel-and-dime noodles around on your fork and you try to imagine crab puffs or plates of peppered shrimp or mango pudding.You try to imagine being surrounded by all your friends, plus some people you've just met, plus a whole restaurant of people speaking in their cafeteria voices (i.e. screaming at the top of their lungs).And then you open your eyes and take a bite.And you realize that you're alone in front of your computer screen with a mouth full of chopstick because in your daydreaming you drop your ramen all over yourself. Fuck.I would crash a mini-motorcycle into someone's groin right now for a plate of their lumpia or shrimp dumplings.Dammit.Does anyone need someone to paint their nails and take them out shopping? I can't keep living like this.Best advice I can give you about Great Wall is to BYOA. Yep.I said it. Bring your own Asian. Thankfully our group of 10 had two. It was critical in navigating the ENORMOUS amounts of food and certainly critical in deciding which things the gringos could handle.Thumbs up to postickers, egg rolls, chow mein noodles, shui mai and other various dumplings. And a big phew for a tutorial on how to eat fresh shrimp. "Peel off the shell, suck out the brains and then eat the rest."Yep. This is where I swig down a cold Tsing TaoAnd the chickens feet. Oh for the love. The freakin' chicken feet. "Just suck off the skin and throw the foot back on the plate."Yep.BYOA! I'm telling ya.I had a BLAST. Carts were everywhere. Service was friendly and swift. Ten of us ate and ate and ate for $200 including tip. Oh. Also one of my Asian American diners informed me that the one man pushing the "porridge" cart only stops at the white people tables because the "porridge" is absolutely frightening to see. Sure enough. He stopped by our tables and scooted quickly by those tables full of Asians. I love a place with a sense of humor. Great food. Great fun. Great Wall.Who knew in midst all of the Mexican restaurants, you'd find a diamond in the rough for Chinese food.  Arizona doesn't have many Chinese restaurants to begin with, however this place rivals the places in CA.  It's not the place for ambience or mood, but the food is the most important for the Chinese and this place is great for dinner or dim sum.   Notes for ordering dishes:I loved the garlic pea sprouts/shoots.  Not all Chinese restaurants this vegetable, but this place makes have it fresh and crunchy and just enough garlic flavor to give it that extra pizzazz.  What I noticed is that this place serves unique fried noodles.  Perfect for vegetarians, this place actually cooked crispy fried noodles unlike most other Chinese restaurant that just comes out with soggy noodles.  Another dish I recommend is their spiced salt tofu. (jiao yan tofu).  Well anything with the spiced salt (jiao yan).  They deep fry the small pieces of tofu or whatever other "jiao yan" producing a crunchy crust and mix it with a salty seasoning and jalapenos.  Great for an appetizer!  My family and I also had their steamed whole fish.  Light flavor and prepared beautifully with the entire moist fish out on the table.  Just the sauce and rice alone tastes just as good.  Be sure to try their walnut shrimp.  Be sure you have a big mouth to fit one of these jumbo shrimp in one bite.  The sauce covering the shrimp has just the right amount of tanginess and sweetness that I'm looking for without being too thick.  And the sweet crunchy walnut complements the dish as well.Ordering the right dishes can make or break your experiences.  For this restaurant, be sure to pick seafood, their specialty.  They have live fish, crabs, etc in clear tanks so you can pick out your dinner victim.  And of course pick fried anything, especially with their spiced salt (jiao yan).Notes for dim sum:Great Wall actually has a unique set of dim sum choices that you can't find anywhere in the valley (at least the Chinese dim sum places I've been to).  Although it's a bit more expensive than the other places in the valley I've been to, but it does taste better overall.  Even the basic dim sum dishes like shrimp dumplings, shumai, and chicken feet simply taste better and I would even say taste better than some CA restaurant.  Who'd thought?  Because the dishes are small, you can try many of them and of course I would go for the fried stuff.  :-) However be careful.  Keep your eye out for the moving carts, if what you want has been sitting there for a while, wait for a new batch.  Cold Chinese food just doesn't taste as well.  Only the tin dishes that are covered are fine, because their still hot after the servers make their rounds.  Go on the weekend for a wider selection and be prepared to have a wait.  But the wait isn't that bad compared to some places I've been to in CA.  Great to go with a medium sized party so you can taste more variety, but not have to wait a long time for a table.Overall, this is a great place to get great Chinese food if you live in the valley and don't want to make a 6hr journey to LA just for good Chinese food (which I have done before).Dim Sum fans look no further! (unless you live on the other side of town, like me).My office used to love the Golden Buddha at the COFCO Center. When it closed, our monthly cravings for Dim Sum went unsatisfied until we heard about this spot. The parking lot is worn down and the location is not close to us. Upon entry, we noticed the clientele matched the cuisine - always a good sign! The seating is much like an adapted ballroom. It looks like they may hold wedding receptions or small events there. The Dim Sum cart came around, and to our joyous surprise, the waitress was one of our old friends from the Golden Buddha!! And, the Dim Sum must have come with her. The pork and shrimp dumplings were very tender and tasty. Careful, though, they're piping hot. The seasame and meat-balls were also good along with the shrimp egg rolls (come in sets of 3). Wash it all down with some hot tea and you're in for an excellent, authentic tasting Chinese lunch.This place has been here for years. For years! I have been coming for years. For years! I still think this place has the best combination of quality dim sum, decor and other menu items. The variety here is just awesome. Golden Buddha, China King, Mekong Plaza, they were decent. Those places were good because you don't really want to travel that far for dim sum and those places were in their respective areas. Except Golden Buddha closed. But for a complete experience, go to Great Wall. You should go on Sundays around 10:30am. That's when their menu is at it's fullest. Asian people go out Sunday mornings haha. There might be a wait but carts will come by more often, more items and you get to see a lot of Asian people. There are also items that are not on carts. Like giant noodle dishes. Don't miss out on them!My wife and I arrived here around 11:00 there was an extremely  Long line, but it moved fast. Inside the place was packed. There wasn't any additional seats, they were booked to capacity. When we checked in with the hostess we were asked if we would be willing to be seated with other people. We said no problem but when our name was called we ended up with just the two of us at the table.The dim sum experience is not for everyone.  Those not accustomed to the noise and crowds should stay away. The place was Jam packed with Chinese families which was a good indication of how the food would be.  All the carts came around frequently. Service was standard for a Dim Sum restaurant. Nothing much to complain about or compliment.  This place was really crowded. It was a bit uncomfortable because the tables are really close to each other, and the aisle aren't hat wide. With the carts going around the place it can get super cramped and uncomfortable. Oh, it was also super noisy, but that shouldn't be a surprise for such a crowded establishment. The servers pushing the carts around were hard to understand so I have no idea what we had or what was in the food but I can tell you we enjoyed all the dishes we picked.None of the dishes really stand out. The food was good, not spectacular, but Just your standard dim sum fare. With the exception of drink refills because no one came around to refill our beverages.FOOD: The menu is standard Dim Sum. PRICE: Expensive -This accounts for why I rated the place only a three. My wife and I spent $30.00 on lunch and didn't really have that much food. I can't imagine what families must spend here on a big meal.   ABIANCE: Nothing fancy but you don't come here for the ambiance you come here or the food. SERVICE: . CONCLUSION:  The food was decent and the price was high for what you get. The décor was non existent and all tables/chairs were all covered and not the most comfortable. However the Great Wall managed to satisfy that dim sum craving but was not even close to the best I've ever had. The search continues. RETURN  FACTOR: 90- 95%************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENTI've been to Great Wall many if times but this is the first with the new owner. I knew him from another restaurant he used to own. Anyways, I went her for dinner. It wasn't for any old dinner but for a Chinese New Year Banquet. This was a celebration with a 10 course meal. So it was supposed to be special. We started out with the Assorted Cold Appetizer Platter which included jelly fish, long thin strips of tofu, thinly cut slices of beef and seaweed salad. It was very different but good. You really never get this dish but at banquets. After this, we had Hangzhou's West Lake Minced Beef soup. It had tiny pieces of grounded beef, tofu, and egg (I think). Very good soup. Then we had Shrimp with Glazed Walnuts that had some shredded carrots on the side. What can I say. Very good. Shrimp, walnuts, and carrots were great. What I really enjoyed was the Fish Fillet with Sugar Peas. The fish was so tender and seasoned perfectly. Wow. We also had Cantonese-style Deep Fried Crispy Chicken, Cantonese-style Roasted Duck, "Lohan" (monk-style) Sautéed Assorted Vegetables, Baby Bok Choy with Mushrooms (huge mushrooms), Yangzhou-style Fried Rice. The chicken and duck were amazing. It was a whole chicken and duck. Very tasty and very moist. The Lohan had all sort of Chinese vegetables I've never heard of but really good. Really different. The Bok Choy and mushrooms were really good. To top our meal off, we had Sesame Seed Sweet Rice Balls. You can usually get this at dim sum places. It's a small tiny ball with sesame seeds on it with some black beans inside. Sweet and chewy. Really good. So this was a banquet with lots of tables which meant the servers were just bringing out dish after dish. You eat a little of each dish and then boom your really full with some really good Chinese food. So if you ever have a chance to go to a Chinese New Years Banquet give it a try cause the food is always outstanding.Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple.  I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart.  From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music.  Cheers!Much different experience the second time around. The second time reveals a disturbing issue. Well this is absolutely disappointing to write. Especially after writing a favorable review of Great Wall the first time around. But our experience here was not good during our last visit.First, we were not acknowledged when we came in the door. We had to pardon an employee (who appeared to be doing nothing) to take us in. He then proceeded to take us to a booth after we requested a table and chairs. We asked again to be seated at a table and chairs and he finally obliged. We were given menus and that's when the real trouble began in terms of service. First, we ordered a lot of food. 2 main dishes, 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an extra side dish to split. It was my last night in Phoenix so I wanted to go all out and sample some different things. Besides, we have the money so who cares right? Well, the drinks came and when we ordered the server let us know there were no BBQ pork ribs, but didn't offer an alternative. When I picked something else, he rolled his eyes and said "So you really want pork?". Yes. I do. So we waited for our appetizers, only one of which came out before the main dishes. The others came out with the dinners. Now the food was good, I have no complaints there. But when the person bringing us the food came out, she would't even look at us. The feeling I was getting was that they were either disgusted with our presence or just didn't care to talk to their non-Asian customers. I say that because the servers were "chatting up" the Chinese folks at their tables (it wasn't a busy night only a few small families), but they were literally ignoring us and a hispanic family sitting adjacent to us. I wouldn't normally write about that but it was so egregious I have to say how it appeared to look. I wish I could say it had something to do with language barriers and being comfortable with your native tongue maybe, but they spoke English fine from what I saw and it just didn't feel good to be ignored. Anyway, no refills on tea, water, or our main drinks were given. When we were done, we were ignored for 20 minutes until I glared at another server who was having banter with an Asian couple near us. I guess he told our server to bring us a check. So we pull out the Amex and what do you know? For the first time all night our server immediately comes over and says in perfect English "we don't take American Express" (even though the tray the bill was on says "Amex Preferred", but that's neither here nor there.Wow. Once it was time to pay, he's on my shoulder like a parrot. Prior to that, he wanted nothing to do with us. Finally, the woman who came out to put the food in 'to-go' bags literally ignored us even after I smiled and tried to talk to her. She turned her head away when my date tried to thank her for putting everything in bags for us. And our sending off? Waiting another 10 minutes for someone to come take the card before giving up and walking to front and giving the bill to someone who appeared to be a manager. No tip given. You've got to be kidding me. In the end this experience wrecked what was supposed to be my new Chinese food place. The service ruined what was great food. The feeling I got while there was that they didn't particularly care if we (non-Chinese customers) were there. And that is really sad. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.
Dairy Queen=I am guilty of eating at this location from time to time as it is close to my home. I have to say I normally like Dairy Queen! It takes me back to the 80's when life was easy breezy! Mmmmm Heath bar blizzard, such a treat! Cherry dilly bar, mmmmm yummy! My issue and complaint is THIS location only! I finally decided to write my review to help others avoid this train wreck of an operation! If I can save one person from eating at this location then I have done my duty! Food is never made or cooked properly! Corn dogs are still frozen in the middle. Blizzards have very little mix ins! Always skimpy! If I order a snickers or heath bar blizzard, come on and put some in it! Cheeseburger tasted fowl and I can't describe the taste and odor other than the memory of tossing it into a bin labeled TRASH. Prices are high for the amount and quality of food you get. The wait for food is ridiculous, after visiting a few times and waiting 20 minutes regardless of what I ordered I knew this place had issues. I should have never returned after my first visit however I was open at the time to give them another shot. Always a long wait and disappointment in what I ordered. This store is clearly a franchise, they are not playing by the rules that is for sure. They cut corners beyond reason and it shows in their service and quality. The staff at this location leaves a lot to be desired. I have cut this location out as an option, it no longer exist to me. The drive thru set up is ridiculous. Try driving in an inside circle and talking through a cup and string speaker system. Stay away from this location! They are only consistent in BAD.This location has been written off of my list for good!Yes Dairy Queen ,an American Favorite. Everyone loves DQ! Though over the years the lce Cream has changed, but what has not.It is a cheap place to go , to get some old time fav's!The Dilly bars and Buster Bars are still around and still pretty good.Though I would like a little more fudge on it.The place is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful.So very much worth a stop in.
Farm Basket=Farm Basket is probably not the cleanest place in the world to eat. In fact, a few insects from inside the restaurant attached themselves to my wife as we were leaving. This place is a grimy and greasy!  My son's head smelled like fried chicken for the rest of the day.  That being said, I didn't want to wash his hair- because I liked it!No joke, this place is great!   For lunch, I chose the 2 piece fried chicken meal (white meat) with mashed potatoes, gravy, and a delicious roll. The chicken was so juicy and seasoned perfectly. Translation - no salt or pepper needed, which is usually the first thing I do to fried chicken. I usually don't like using my hands to eat food, but I had no choice with this chicken. I felt like a fork and knife would have slowed down my eating process.  Instead, I shoved that chicken in my face and made all kinds of embarrassing animal noises until there was no meat left on 'dem bones. My wife opted for the cluck-e-tos, which were chicken taquitos with lettuce, cheese, and salsa. I was able to sneak a bit of these crunchy delights while keeping an eye on my chicken to make it wasn't going anywhere.  I have always associated taquitos with those frozen things that come in a 96-pack at Costco. This experience has made me a believer in this Americanized appetizer. The only thing that would make these better would be guacamole. (I'll trade the lettuce in for guacamole any day)My kids tried the chicken fingers which I rank third on the list of menu items. The chicken wasn't nearly as tender as the fried chicken, and was not anything special to yelp about.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention those incredible French fries. These thin cut fries were cooked perfectly, and had just the right amount of seasoning. In fact, next time I will sub out the mashed potatoes for the fries instead. The staff was super friendly, and the food came out really fast. However, the dining area is small, and is not wheelchair accessible. All 6 of us were crammed into the back corner trying our best to not kick each other under the table.  But, with food this good - I can put up with it.  I won't go anywhere else for chicken--EVER!I do not have nostalgic memories to inflate my rating of this business, being that I neither 'grew up' on Farm Basket (I imagine I would not be as strong and healthy if I had) nor even ever heard of them in any way before stepping in to the lone remaining area establishment on account of needing calories FAST. PRO: The calories are indeed delivered to you fast. Seriously no more than two minutes after stepping through the open doorway I had my food in a tiny white bag -- seeping grease from it in various spots -- in my hand and on my way. CON: The food provided was grossly over*priced as well as fairly unimpressive. If you are going to charge Chick-Fil-A or Raising Cane's prices, I expect it to be close to the same quality (minus the unabashed homophobia and Jesus music playing in the case of CFA).PRO: They are a non-chain business (?) in a world of chains galore. CON: They won't be an any-type of business if they keep salting their fries so heavily that they will single-handedly kill all of their loyal clientele. My blood pressure might have tripled succeeding eating my small fries, which had more salt on them than I have had in months, combined.Conclusion: Their tagline is "We're Carried Away With Quality"; the truth is that they are carried away with their use of salt. Do not recommend unless you are suffering from dilutional hyponatremia. - ESo these guys have been here forever I heard. After coming here, WHY is my question.First of all, I was looking for a chicken combo meal. You know, a couple pieces of chicken, fries, and a drink. Let's see.......you can have a sandwich combo, a chicken finger combo, and a clucketo combo. They have a chicken combo but it does not come with a drink. That's not really a combo dude! So after looking around the place, I noticed everybody that was eating didn't have any actual chicken on their plates. All I saw were chicken fingers, sandwiches, and clucketos (chicken taquitos). As if that wasn't enough of  a clue that the chicken wasn't good. So I opted for the Gobbler Combo, which is a turkey sandwich. The turkey itself is a breaded patty and deep fried. They give you a small package of mayo to flavor it, which I thought sorely needed it. The fries it came with were dry and covered with a lot of salt. Sadly, it could not save those poor potato sticks. After forcing myself to eat the turkey sandwich, against my better judgement, I actually wanted to try their chicken so I got a leg and a wing. Might as well have been a piece of rubber and styrofoam. Service was mysteriously fast. After further observation, it looks like they cook everything in advance and put it under warmers. I know this because not one second has passed since I hand over my debit card, they have one of the cooks handing me the two pieces of cardboard......err I mean chicken in a bag. I literally saw him pulling the chicken out of the warmer. So after taking a bite which should have been a nibble, I was afraid it was gonna bite me back. I would not give this stuff to a starving homeless person. That would be considered an insult. So to the reader, please, PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE. To the owner, since you have been there forever, I assume you got nothing to worry about since you got some people to actually come back and eat here.In the words of Drake, the Farm Fries here "be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there." In theory, anyway. Fries plus chicken gravy (with pieces of fried chicken) and shredded cheese, in a giant portion, for $4.  Except the gravy could be better, and the cheese is cheap and rendered almost tasteless. But if you can overlook the fact that the product could be better, it's excellent for drowning your sorrows in on a bad day.That being said, the chicken is largely regarded as mediocre and I ordered the clucketos and was underwhelmed as well- crispy, topped with lettuce and cheese, served with a side of salsa, but stuffed with chicken ground so finely as to make me suspicious of it's quality. And "The Gobbler" is basically a dry-as-ashes fried piece of poultry (you can't even taste that it's turkey), about on par in size and appearance with the "Chicken Littles" or "Snackers" at KFC, served with packets of cranberry and Miracle Whip. Not only is the sandwich sad, small, and disgusting, but it's not worth more than a buck or two.And whoever created Miracle Whip should be burned at the stake.As others have said, order was ready in a flat two minutes- which is remarkable. Frankly I'm surprised the clucketos were so crisp because I can't figure out how they cooked them so fast. But those fries, man... it's actually kind of a blessing they're not better. I mean unless your life goal is to weigh four hundred pounds.I love this chicken joint!  The only disappointment in this place is its so far from where we live and it's the only one in town. The chicken, mayonnaise and cranberry is the bomb!  The drive thru is a tight squeeze coming in and out but when the food hrs my taste buds I forget about the drive and the drive thru.  That's all I have to say about that.
Mercado Y Carniceria Sepulved A=This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many "Libras" (Pounds) and you want them to make it "Preparada" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!
Eat'n Park Restaurant=Eat N Park is not my favorite local chain.  The food and service is constantly hit or miss across the chain.  This Eat N Park, however, is one of the few non-smoking, late-night options in Squirrel Hill, which takes it up a notch.I usually order the American Scrambler, which is just a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich with a fruit cup and potatoes.  It is reasonably priced and enough food to fill me.  Stick to simple things when you order here for the best results.The service is usually friendly, and I like the remodel a lot.  It's not always fast, but it is the best late night option for me!
John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill=John Mull's Meats also does BBQ catering under Road KIll Grill. 2008 Taste & Sounds of Soul Winner.I ventured downtown to the Taste & Sounds of Soul Friday & Saturday to indulge in some good bbq and soul food.Friday night was a packed house with long lines and a huge crowd enjoying the entertainment on the main stage at Fitzgerald's.I walked up & down the tent area of vendors and there was about 8-10 food vendors serving bbw,asian,seafood gumbo,turkey legs,giant cajun shrimp,fried catfish,shrimp and hushpuppies,funnel cakes and lots of pies and cakes.The lines were outrageous. H&H Bar-B-Q with a big red smoker trailer had a line of 50+ people about 75 yards long the longest by far.Phat Katz BBQ had 30-40 people waiting. Usually long lines and full parking lots are a sign of excellent food, service,etc.This would not be the case here.Road Kill Grill was the 1st stand in the food court and the line was short because it moved rapidly.I had the 5-bonz/w tips rib dinner w/2 sides for $10-I had mac n cheese and macaroni salad. I also ordered 2 sandwiches-a pulled pork and a beef brisket. SOdas were $1.The ribs were rub no sauce. Nice smoky taste very tender and very meaty. the tips were the best. juicy and oh so yummy.The mac n cheese was better than I've found at any storefront BBq and the macaroni salad was great too.The pork sandwich was great, sauce had a little zip and the bread was very fresh and quite remarkable.The beef brisket was some of the best I've had could've used a little crust & rub but very juicy & tender. Sauce on the side.I wish they had a stand at Lowe's or Home Depot or something because this guy knows his BBQ.Fantastic Barbecue!!!! I've waited an entire year to come back to this event and eat at this bbq stand!!! Some of the BEST BBQ anywhere!!!I of course opted for the 3 meat & 3 side meal getting Ribs,Pulled Pork,Brisket plus baked macaroni and cheese and macaroni & potato salads. 3+3=$16 well worth it.Bottled water & Canned Soda were only $1 too!!! The food is ordered at one end and served at another to keep it moving-other vendors have 30+ minute wait because of their disorganized service.Immediately upon opening my order I noticed I had been given a leg & thigh of bbq chicken and NO pulled pork or Macaroni and Cheese. When I went back to explain they graciously provided me the missing items. and I ended up with an extra piece of chicken. Fair enough for the inconvenience;)The food was really good. Perfectly cooked barbecue. The ribs falling of the bone tender and moist with a great bbq sauce on the side. The brisket -some of BEST ever!! Tender melt in your mouth sliced paper thin!! The chicken was smoked through but moist and tender plus it had a little kick to it. The Pulled pork was great but was already sauced(personally I prefer adding my own) The macaroni & potato salads were homemade and pretty good but the baked macaroni and cheese was a little overdone and mushy with no crunchy topping to indicate it being BAKED mac n chz and no real cheese flavor.John Mulls Meats operates a butcher shop in NW Las Vegas and does event catering but this event is the ONLY time they come out during the year so get down to FREMONT and check them out before it's too late. Taste & Sounds of Soul goes on through February 21st!!!I love butchers.  I especially love a butcher shop run by a family who knows their meats, and John Mull's is it.  I've been to a few others around town, but this place is spotless, the entire building is like a walk in freezer (meaning fresh meat out of the back and stays fresh while cutting and bagging) and it's a simple set up.  You have the cash counter up front where you grab a paper that has this 2 page list of all the cuts you can get, and then the old man behind the counter -- who is totally awesome and very sweet -- helps you with thickness and cooking tips.I cannot believe how many varieties of meats they have available, and what made me even more intrigued was their smoked bacon slabs, done right in the smoke house on site.  Oh yeah, baby.  Sweet lovin' bacon slabs, cut to order.  I grabbed 1.5 lbs of their smoked bacon (without rind cause they suggested it that way), two 1" ribeye steaks cut FRESH from the slab, and 4 pork chops cut thick enough for pan frying cut fresh off the slab.  It was fun to watch, fun to order, and a shocker at the register.All that meat, ALL that meat was 25 bucks.  WOW.  I freaked out.  I know that the pork was at least 6 pounds and the ribeyes were 18oz each, and then the bacon...all for 25 bucks?  I was happy as can be walking out of there.Screw the supermarkets.  I'm buying my meats from John Mull's from now on.  They have all I need when I need it.  If you're looking for a butcher up in the northwest area, head to this place.  It's worth the drive, and was a well kept secret of the neighborhood until now.  PS: They cater, so if you want great bbq just ask when you get there.  You can also call and order things in advance.Show me the meat! This is where you need to go in Vegas to get all of your carnivorous cravings satisfied. Yeah, it's a little off the beaten path, but follow Google Maps and you should be A-OK. Don't let the exterior fool you, either, 'cause this place is legit.Walk inside and you'll be handed a menu and will most likely have to wait in a short line to give your order. Or call ahead and they'll have packaged and ready to go for you. It's basically a giant meat locker with a friendly staff behind a counter ready to chop, grind or whatever else you need them to do to your meat. So many choices, too! We got several things, but what sticks out in my mind was the sweet sausage. Yeah, I said it: sweet sausage. Make all the jokes you want, 'cause I don't care. It was tasty.I'm all about supporting small local businesses but I was lied to by John Mull employees about something I consider important.I called once and asked if they carried grass fed, pasture raised beef. The woman who answered the phone said yes so I went down and purchased two steaks. I verified one more time before purchasing that the beef was grass fed and again I was told yes. The steaks tasted great, but grass fed beef has a particular taste.Feeling skeptical, I called again today to see if they had any more in stock and to get the name of their supplier. The woman who answered the phone consulted with someone else and told me they don't carry grass fed beef, nor have they ever.ANYBODY CRAVING SPOTTED DICK?!!If you've seen King Ralph with John Goodman, you know what I'm talking about.I stopped by this afternoon to use my $40 groupon. If you haven't heard of this place, you probably would never have found it. It's a hidden gem in a residential area.I picked up 3 Ribeye ($11.99/lb) and 2 lbs of Korean Style Ribs ($5.49/lb). You can have the steaks cut to the thickness of your liking. I had the Ribeye for dinner tonight and it was so much better than the Ribeye that Wal-mart sells for the same price.Both ladies at the counter were very friendly. I will mos def come back to try some of the other meats.After seeing this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, I decided to give it a try.  Guy F. was raving about the place.   Ask any BBQ pro about boiling ribs and they will look at you like you just stole their elderly mother's life savings.  John Mull's boils their ribs before finishing on the grill but Guy stated "this is competition meat".So I make the trip there, really strange looking neighborhood and place.  Tiny on the inside, luckily it was not crowded.  I ordered a 2 meat combo.  Ribs and links, I told the young man preparing my plate that I wanted my sauce on the side, he said they don't put sauce on the meat, sauce is over on the counter.  Good sign.   I looked around as he was preparing my plate then went over to put some sauce in the little containers.   All set, got my food and headed out the door.  Not really any place to eat there except for some picnic benches outside but it was far too hot to be outside so I decided to head to the nearest covered lot and eat in my car.    Finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast!Opened my tray and found that this idiot kid covered my ribs with the links that were swimming in sauce!!!!  I literally wanted to scream!  I told the idiot I didn't want sauce on my ribs yet he proceeded to put the cut links and sauce on top of my ribs.Anyway, started on the ribs and they were not very good at all, tender but no flavor at  and the sauce sucked!   The links tasted like hot dogs.   Overall not good Q.Thanks Guy!!!   I was at another restaurant and the owner claimed that Triple D requests a fee for them to visit your restaurant.   I believe that.  Have you ever seen Guy say "that place was just OK'??I am not a big BBQ eater when I go out to eat.  All of the chains I've been to just don't live up to a good home BBQ'ed meal.  I am pretty sure their motto is "skimp on the meat because they can't taste it through our 'award winning' BBQ sauce!"  John Mull's puts these chains to shame and lives up to any claims about being as good as home BBQ!The place itself resides on a small ranch and has that Old Nevada feel to it.  As a native to this state, I love that about the location.  A dirt parking lot and old wooden fences/structures make me feel like I am on a Nevada road trip.  There is a small out door seating area, but I prefer to take my food over to the Tenaya Creek brewery and have a nice IPA with my BBQ... SO GOOD!So far I have had the brisket, the ribs, a little bit of pulled pork and chicken.  This place has the best brisket I have ever had!  The stuff sits in it's own juices all day, and is incredibly tender and juicy.  "Wow" is all I can say about the brisket after hating this cut from other places.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  Just amazing stuff.  Same goes for the pulled pork and chicken, although the pulled pork is a bit on the salty side.  The BBQ sauce has a thick, lightly sweet quality to it.  I prefer the spicy one (it's not that spicy).  But you really don't need BBQ sauce at all.  That is how good the meat is.  The dry rub kicks the crap out of every place I've been to.  All of the sides are amazing as well.  The only thing I am not a big fan of are the desserts, but that doesn't matter to me because the "dinner" portions are so huge that you won't have room for dessert anyway.  Really the dinners are enough for two maybe even three people with that brisket.Folks, seek this one out.  Take it from a guy that doesn't do Generic Dave's Memphis Subpar BBQ, The BBQ is outstanding here.I went here with three of my friends for the first time. They are like in the middle of nowhere, and we thought we were lost. The place itself looks like a ranch! (wait maybe it is a ranch lol) because they butcher their own meat. So you can count on the meat being extremely fresh! Now be forewarned, this isn't a place to come to with a large group of people to actually eat here. You are supposed to order your food and take it home as they really don't have much seating area.As for the food, wow, I ordered just the hot links sandwich, and the sauced version of the hot links blew me away. The portions are large and the price is fair.If you are tired of going to Lucilles, Famous Daves, Tony Romas ribs, and other chains, then come here and try this place out! True southern-like BBQ house.Oh and this place was featured on the "Food" Network for top BBQ houses in the country by the way!If you are looking for good ole' southern eats, look no further. Seriously. Stop. This is the real deal.I have been lucky enough to eat at John Mull's throughout the years. My most recent was when we had them cater for our company lunch. Best decision we had made in a very long time.They set up in our parking lot and you could just smell the good food cooking away.We had ribs, chicken, brisket, sausage, mac & cheese, baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad, peach cobbler, rolls and assorted BBQ sauces.The mac & cheese is simply some of the best I have ever had. It was cheesy but not greasy. It was ooey and gooey and the perfect balance of flavors.The baked beans! HOLY MOLY! I am not a big baked bean person but these beans were delicious. They were mixed with ground beef and a concoction of seasonings that just kept me wanting more. Out of the meats, the spareribs were my favorite. They were tender and just delicious. The brisket was good too - juicy and smokey. The chicken was actually pretty good too. Not dry at all. The sausages, well who doesn't like a good old sausage.There is never a reason to pass up on something this good. I promise. Good food, Great portions, Reasonable prices.This review is for the Road Kill Grill section.Looking for this place off of Thom Blvd, you can easily miss it if you are not looking hard enough. What's funny is that they have two decent sized signs and I still almost ended up passing them. You are actually in the middle of a neighborhood and all of a sudden you see several small ranch style buildings. It kind of looks like a western setting for an old cowboy movie.Once you find the dirt/gravel parking lot, make your way to the building that says John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill. When you come in, the bulk meat ordering section is to your right while the hot food section is to your left. You tell the attendant behind the hot food counter what you want and they will put it in a to go container for you coming from pans that are already prepared. What I ordered was the 2 meat combo for 14 dollars. The 3 meat was only 2 dollars more but damn, I know for sure I am not gonna finish the 2 meat. Meat choices were Hot Links, Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, 1/4 Chicken, Rib Tips, and Tri Tip on Tues and Thursday only. I chose the Brisket and Pulled Pork. Comes with your choice of 2 sides which were Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, Baked Beans, Green Beans, Cole Slaw, and Mac n Cheese. I opted for the Potato Salad and Mac n Cheese. If you refer to my picture, its a lot of food!So when you pay towards the end of the counter, you have a choice of regular or spicy barbeque sauce in a little to go cup. I sampled both and the spicy was better than the original. Not make you sweat spicy, but just that little flavor kick to get you going. What's pretty cool is that they have the sauces in warmers so you get it heated.Once you pay, you have the option of going home, staying in your car, or look for one of several tables outside to sit down and eat. Remember, the building you came from only houses the butcher meats and hot foods only.Service is decent. From my assumption if the place is packed you will definitely have to wait a while. Of course you can call ahead and pick up also.Some random info. Their bathroom is literally in the back where all their pits and smokers are so if you need to go you can probably catch the cooks in action. I suggest getting the 3 meat combo to share cuz its a lot of food and you can save money! The roads leading up to their place is all 25 miles per hour. On certain days, cops like to meet their quota by hanging out around this area so watch your speed!So overall, they have some decent barbeque here. I just wouldn't make an extra special trip just to eat here though.Some decent 'Que on my side of town!I'll admit, I had to check out this place after it was featured on "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" on the Food Network.  But without this tidbit, I might have never knew the place existed!Funniest thing about John Mull's is that it is basically located in the middle of residential homes.  Yes!  When you GPS the address you might think you're being led to the wrong place.  But keep truckin' because the BBQ joint is on property of what looks to be a ranch house.  John Mull's eating area shares the common space with what is essentially a butcher block.  Get a whole cow, some eggs, and then a meal of BBQ afterwards?  I don't see why not.While the market has been around for some time, my review basically goes over the BBQ station.  It used to be just a shack when they first started, lately I hear they have a small food truck type deal to serve folks as well.  They need the help, John Mull's can get busy for lunch!  Typically it's take-out, but they do have a small seating area with about a dozen bench tables or so.  If it's full, eat it out of your truck tailgate like most folks do!I am not an expert on BBQ by any means, but good food I can do.  Sure, you have your naysayers that go on and on and on about how their BBQ sauce is from a bottle (I can confirm I think it is), but really I don't care.  The meat itself is not artificially processed.  Trimmed in-house, and smoked in-house!  Flavor of the BBQ is what is necessary!  John Mull's makes some mighty decent 'Que.  Easiest thing on the menu to try if you're a noob to this place is just to go with a combo meal.  A 2 Meat Combo will run you about $14, and a 3 Meat Combo will run about $16.  When it's the wifey and I we usually opt for the 3 Meat Combo and share.  Be careful, it's a lot of food!  The 3 Meat Combo will easily feed a third person.  Combos come with your choice of meats and sides.  Meats include:-Hot Link-Brisket-Ribs-Pulled Pork-Pulled Chicken-1/4 ChickenTheir strength lies in their ribs and brisket I think.  I like their pulled pork, but if I'm having their ribs (which I always do) I compliment it with the brisket.  The ribs are cooked just right, requisite pink ring around the outside, meat pulls off the bone (but not too easily), super moist and tender, finished on the grill with a slathering of BBQ sauce right before serving.  The brisket is flavorful, and just plain juicy, thanks to the lovely fat cap that surrounds each one before smoking.  OK, if you just say 'brisket' when you order your meat, you will most likely just get the lean end of the brisket.  Which is not dry, but not as near darn tasty as the fatty end.  So be specific on which part of brisket you want, lean or fat.  I will usually ask for a 1/2 portion of both.  For sides, Road Kill Grill has some options too:-Potato or Macaroni Salad-Coleslaw-Baked Beans-Mac & Cheese-Green BeansUnfortunately, no collard greens or black eyed peas!  But you can't have everything.  I will mention that the green beans are just mainly reheated from the can, so I mainly skip that.  The baked beans are very good, and their mac & cheese is actually pretty stellar.  I also enjoy their potato salad.Combos and meals come with slices of white bread if you request, but don't forget to ask!  It won't always come with it included.  Also, get some extra BBQ sauce!  I know the sauce may be bottled, but they let it simmer on the side most of the day, so the flavor does concentrate nicely.  The hot BBQ sauce has a nice kick so watch out.  Kaboom!  It's overall great eats, just don't forget extra napkins and extra wet wipes!  It will get messy.  Which one of you city people eat BBQ with a knife and fork?  That's what the white bread is for!Another item I usually order when we eat at Road Kill Grill is a sandwich.  They load these suckers nicely so you get a nice portion of meat and sauce to bread.  Basically a meal in itself!  I enjoy the hot links sandwich in particular.  This with extra hot BBQ sauce on top, and a side of coleslaw?  Classic.  BBQ can be a very picky topic, so you will see tons of varying reviews on John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill.  This is because depending on what side of the country you are from, you have a different taste of what BBQ should be.  Some like tomato based, some like vinegar based, some like mustard based, and so forth and so forth.  Some folks like more smoke, some folks like less smoke, Hell, some folks like their BBQ baked in an oven instead.  But no matter what, we all like good food.  And I think Road Kill Grill overall has good food.Give them a try for yourself.  You might like, but then again you might NOT like.  Many reviews for this place are in the 3 or 4-star range, I tracked over to the 4-star area because I like it here.  In a place like Las Vegas it's difficult to find good 'Que that's not from a place like Famous Dave's or Memphis Championship BBQ.  Nuff' said.Would you look at that?  If you drive to the Northwest and take a few lefthand turns, you end up in a stockyard in Kentucky!  Almost.  From the minute you get out of your car and see the line wrapping around the shed, you know you are in for a unique experience.  Get in line on the left for an awesome lunch or turn to the right to go into the deli and order fresh meat.  We chose lunch.  John Mull's is good.  Really good.  I can't go so far as to say it's better than Rollin Smoke, but I will say they are totally different animals, offering totally different experiences.  There's just something about ordering at a food cart and eating outside that adds magic to BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and stole a rib from my boyfriend.  The ribs!  So tender.  And the potato salad and mac n cheese were both incredibly good sides.  Apparently, they are only open til 6 p.m. so go early and go hungry.  Portions are huge!Whenever I'm making a special recipe, I come here for the meat. LOVE the short ribs!Call ahead and order for pick-up so you don't have to wait. It gets pretty busy in there. Right now, I'm looking at a line outside for their barbecue. I've brought friends here to eat and they've enjoyed the food. I still haven't found the best barbecue, you know, the kind you crave and drive many miles for? But, for the meantime I'm good with John.This has definitely been on my Vegas Eats bucketlist for quite some time. The reviews have always been great, but it's a long ways from my Henderson digs, so I hadn't had a chance to test out some Road Kill Grill. Good grief was it worth the wait. Rather than enjoy the best BBQ in Vegas alone I decided to bring an entourage. It was just before the Christmas holiday so I grabbed all of my closest co-workers to enjoy a fun holiday lunch with one another. I'm pretty sure between the entire group of 6 we ordered the entire menu. Personally, I went with a 3 meat combo that included ribs, chicken, and pulled pork. For my sides I went with a double load of mac n' cheese. That was an excellent choice as their M&C was off the hook. The ribs had fantastic flavor. I do like them to fall off the bone a little more, but they weren't tough at all. The pulled pork was the best I've ever had and they give you a mountain sized portion. The chicken was my least favorite as it had a little bit of a gassy flavor. I think it might have been a bit of smoke overload, though it was incredibly tender. Next time I would probably drop the chicken and go with the brisket or a hot link since those looked so good. The icing on the cake was the corn bread you got with it. Sweet and the perfect complement to a great meal. The 3 meat combo was literally enough food to feed 3 people, so be advised that you will likely have leftovers if you go this route.The seating area is very informal. Picnic style which is great for a large group. Only warning I would give is that it's all outdoor seating, so weather could be a factor. They do have heaters that keep it relatively warm on a cold day. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill. Next time I'm definitely planning on visiting the butcher shop to load up my freezer. Great stuff!I love me some bbq!! Mmm mmm....when I smell that smoke and see the beautiful site of ribs, sausage and brisket on the grill I truly get excited. This place came highly recommended on Triple D, thus we took a venture to see what all the hype was about. Let's talk about the location. It's located in the middle of a neighborhood which kind of caught me off guard at first. You see all these houses, and then WHAM....there is this house that has a huge grilling operation going on behind it. The people that work here are very friendly. Laughing, smiling and helping you make a good choice for what to eat. I ordered their 3 meat combo which came with brisket, pulled pork and ribs (disclaimer: they don't offer burnt tips! That's a bbq no no in my book). For my sides I had greens and yams. The cashier kind of twisted my arm to get their banana pudding for a dessert.After we sat down to eat, I first dove into the yams which was delicious. Good texture and nice and sweet. The greens were also really yummy as well. They also give you a cornbread muffin which was good, not the best I've ever had....but good. Not really sweet like I like my cornbread. Now the meat. I saw no smoke ring on any of the meat I ordered, so I was concerned about how this was going to taste. I first bit into the brisket which was a little disappointing. I don't think the smoke got into it at all, and the flavor was just ok. The ribs were really good. Not very much smoke, but they have a great dry rub that packs in some good flavor. The rib meat was also a little tougher than what I would like, but it was still good. The pulled pork was really the savior. Great texture and huge flavor!Now it was time for the banana pudding. This thing was amazing! Nice and thick pudding with big time flavor. The Nilla wafers were nice and crunchy, and the bananas weren't brown. I will say this is top 2 best banana puddings I've ever had.....next to my moms of course ;-)Overall, I liked my experience here. Good atmosphere and good food. If you've read my other reviews about Texas bbq, then you know I'm a fan of how they do it in the south. This place is not as good as good as Texas bbq. Not enough smoke, and the meat texture needed a little bit of help. If I had to break it down, I would give this place a solid 3 star on the bbq and a 5 star for the dessert and customer service.Can anyone outside of Texas beat them in bbq? I'm still on the hunt!Cheers!Worthy of the hype. Wait for Saturday lunch wasn't too bad just after noon, line itself isn't that long but goes a bit slow. Employees are working hard with smiles on their faces, though.But you come here for the food! The three meat plate is the best value, and the portions are huge- this is easily split between a couple, add on a dessert if you dare. The HOTLINK is "easily one of the best I've had," says the BF. We both thought the RIB TIPS were amazing, and were both a little pickier than necessary about the BRISKET- blame our time in Texas for that, but it's still lightyears better than most other versions here in Vegas.The sides are pretty solid, too: the COLLARD GREENS are seasoned well with meat and onions mixed in, but the MAC AND CHEESE wins all the awards here- it's one of the best versions I've had outside of someone's home. The CORNBREAD and PEACH COBBLER also were really good, and clearly homemade.Menu is small, but everything we tried was really well executed. Location has some limitations, but I like the down home style. I'll definitely be keeping it in mind the next time a barbecue craving hits.I decided to take a little adventure to North Las Vegas. Since I'm never in the area it made sense to try to hit as many of my bookmarks as possible. John Mull's was one of these locations. Located in a more residential part of the of town, I was surprised when we arrived at the restaurant. It has a rural BBQ restaurant feel, which I really liked. We stood in line and I decided to order the three meat combination with rib tips, ribs and pulled pork with a side mac & cheese and baked beans. I paid at the counter and they they give you a receipt to hand to the guys in the trailer. It was a little disorganized it the guys made sure to take all the customers in the proper order. They informed me that they were out of rib tips and I opted for the hot links instead. I don't usually like sausage but this ended up being my favorite part of the meal. The ribs and pulled pork were also good but the standouts were the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was so cheese and delicious. It was some of the best I've had in town.The service was really nice and friendly. I was especially impressed by the guys serving up the food. They ran out of cornbread and when I asked about white bread the guy went out of his way looking for some for me and was so apologetic when he couldn't locate any. I'm not a huge BBQ fan typically but I can't wait to try this place when I find myself in North Las Vegas again.I hadn't been by John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill in over a year and was craving some chicken, so I decoded to brave the lunch crowd for a cure. This place is in a residential neighborhood which surprises some, but I'm used to it from growing up in the neighborhood. I came here long before the Road Kill Grill opened when we would bring the deer my dad brought back from hunting each year here for processing. There is a decent sized dirt lot for parking, but just know that depending on the time of day you stop by might depend on you getting a spot or not. When I pulled into the lot this last visit, I was the only car and literally every single car that was behind me pulled in and there was no parking spots just that fast. That meant the line inside was going to get long fast, so I picked up my pace and headed in. I was greeted with a welcoming "hello" and then a girl came over and wrote down what I wanted. The guy behind the counter packed up my order and asked if I wanted any extra BBQ sauce. They have picnic tables in a couple areas outside if you want to eat out there or you can get your order to-go. 2 Meat Combo ($14.65) - I chose chicken and sliced hot links for the meats. All combos come with two sides and I chose baked beans and macaroni and cheese. For an additional $2.75 I also added a side of green beans. The chicken fell off the bone and had such a great taste! The chicken is worth coming here for alone and tasted just like I remembered. Chicken craving cured! I liked the sliced hot links, yum! I did like the BBQ sauce and liked that it was a sauce with actual flavor instead of just being overpowered by nasty vinegar. The macaroni and cheese here is hit or miss from what I have experienced and it's all about the texture that's different. There might be a time when the macaroni and cheese is creamy and oh so good and then there are times like my last visit where it's pasty and not so great. I enjoyed the baked beans however can do without whatever meat is in them. Bacon in the beans would be more what I'd prefer, but I have family and friends that love the baked beans just the way they are here. We all have our own tastes! The green beans were good and I liked the random pieces of pork mixed in. Oh yeah, you get to pick either a roll or corn bread to go with your meal. It's a lot of food and depending on your appetite it could easily be shared with someone. Just come by and try the chicken and thank me later :)
Chopstix Express=Attention folks! Do you like hard, flavorless, uncooked boxed brown rice that taste like it was made weeks prior? Do you like ordering a chicken dish and it is mostly vegetables? Yeah! Awesome, then you will love this place then if you answered yes to the following questions! If half of your taste buds are in operation then please AVOID this atrocity at ALL cost! The only thing that are ok is their crab Rangoon's, other than that go take a big chunky dump in a bag and dig in, you would love that more than any entree from this place! Waste of money! Bad Bad Bad food! I feel ripped off! $13 bucks down the drain on garbage!Don't do it! Please...don't don't do it!
Rose Tea Café=I ate here a few Saturday nights ago with my girlfriend for dinner.  I have been coming here for the past five years or so, more often than not for their bubble tea and have only ever eaten here once before.  The inside of the restaurant is fairly small but not overly crowded which is nice.  On one side of the restaurant is an enclosed counter where you can order food to go or watch them make the bubble tea and the rest of the restaurant is made up of tables and chairs.For my dinner entrée I decided to have something a little different than my normal selections and went with the chicken and broccoli in a black pepper sauce.  Whenever the dish came out it looked exactly as I would have expected with some broccoli and chicken in a dark brown sauce that had visible pepper in it and side of rice.  The sauce was good but not nearly as spicy as I was expecting based upon the little chili pepper that was next to it on the menu.  It paired well with the chicken and broccoli and I ended up thoroughly enjoying my meal.  I especially enjoyed that my broccoli was cooked just right and was crispy instead of being overcooked and mushy.  My girlfriend also enjoyed her meal which was the eggplant in garlic sauce.  Her eggplant was also cooked nicely and the sauce was very similar to the one that I had except instead of the pepper it seemed to have a nice garlic flavor.  Before we left I also ordered a Large Green Lemon Bubble tea which I enjoyed on the way home.  They always seem to make it perfectly with a not too sweet flavor that goes well with the citrus and ample amounts of tapioca pearls at the bottom which get you through the entire drink.The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future.  With how good my food tasted I can see myself coming here more often and not just because I love the bubble tea.I've been to Rose Tea several times in the last three years, tried a variety of the food on the menu, but I've never been a huge fan. Came back here again last night because the boyfriend sprained his toe so we are eating whatever he wants to eat. After giving Rose Tea another chance, I'll admit I'm glad I did. It's a small, busy Taiwanese restaurant. We went for dinner on a Sunday night at 6:30pm and had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. Ordered the deep fried salt & pepper squid (a bit too salty, but still good that we ate most of it) and the short ribs w eggplant (very good, although I didn't try the eggplant). He got the lychee green tea (which he loved but I thought was too sweet) and I got the black milk tea w wheat germ (which I loved but he thought was just good, not great). Portions are great; these two dishes were more than enough for two people. The lady who took our order was friendly and adorable. She tried to squeeze behind me a couple times during the meal and joked in Mandarin that she needed to lose weight (she doesn't!). This was probably my best experience here in terms of food. Their bubble teas have always been good. Given my precious experiences here, I'm not sure if I would give it an overall rating of 3 or 4; 3.5 seems about right. This experience alone though was probably a 4. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 3.5OVERALL | 3.5
Pizza Mia=I am not really a big fan of pizza, even less so of mediocre ones. Right now my stomach is unhappy with me over my impulse choice for lunch.  The peperoni pizza I got was lukewarm, greasy and chewy.  Flavor wasn't too bad.There is no inside seating, the one time one of my employees went over to get lunch for the crew she had to wait outside.  So it is take out or delivery only.  They (crew) did say they thought the subs were better than the pizza and both of them like pizza.So how did I end up consuming a 12" pizza for lunch?  Every so often in the late morning one of their drivers comes through the complex offering pizzas for $6.00 (used to be $5).  That really is a pretty good price for a delivered one topping pizza.  Selling door to door like that I didn't even think about a tip and after eating the pizza I didn't feel bad about it.  You do have to admit it is a pretty good marketing scheme to hit up industrial areas just before lunch.  I think he only starts with 10-12 pies so they cannot get too cold before he is done.  I usually pass and will for quite a while yet now.
Santa Fe Mining Company=We always drove by this place and noticed it's filled with a decent amount of people. We decided to come check them out since most places were closed on Thanksgiving, but bars will be open even if the effing Rapture comes.So I was feeling a beer, but there wasn't much selection (at least for a craft person like me). Grabbed ice teas and we shared a "tall" (24oz, $5) of NewCastle. This place has some really cheap pitchers (I believe they range from $5-9 bucks during game times/happy hour)  so it's a good spot if you like whats on draft (Bud, Bud Light, Miler, Coors, Newcastle, Fat Tire, Pyramid Hefe). We got some appetizers:Fried Mushrooms ($6.99)- these were quite nice. The batter was nicely seasoned and stayed very crunchy despite it holding a watery vegetable. I really like fried mushrooms but most places don't have a batter that holds up. Artichoke&Spinach dip ($6.99)- pretty standard, but done right. Melty, creamy goodness. I appreciate that the chips were warm. Dinners:I grabbed the Red Rock chicken sandwich (grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce and melted swiss cheese- $8.49) and got it with a side of potato salad. The sandwich was juicy and had a good crispy char. It was rather tall once the lettuce, onions, pickles and top bun come into play so it's a fork and knife kinda situation. The potato salad is the usual mustard mayo base and what I would describe best as a "family picnic style" w/ some shredded carrot, black olive, hardboiled egg, and a bit of macaroni. The BF got a turkey club ($7.99) with spicy fries. The key with a club is crispy grilled bread (both sides), crispy bacon, quality turkey slices and fresh veggies in a proper ratio and you're golden. The spicy fries are not spicy, but more "spice-y" with a good layer of seasoning. Yeah, we had a bit of room for dessert and grabbed a Xango (Deep fried banana caramel cheesecake wrapped in a pastry crust rolled in cinnamon sugar, topped with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar and whipped cream, $4.29) This was okay. Posed a bit of problem with the filling gushing out, but the flavors were decent. FYI- I posted pics and prices to help out, there is a usmenuguide for this place, but it is outdated. Originally we dropped by a few days ago and while we were perusing the menu, the GM said they can't serve food because of a grease fire occurred a few hours earlier and it'll be a while. He apologized since he blanked out on it, gave us his card and invited us back to give them a try. He was so nice so we definitely made it a point to come back in. He did give us a discount for our meal, but definitely it was some solid bar food. I'm slowly starting to appreciate American food...haven't before and it's little quiet bars that are changing my mind about it. The only place for me that it lacks on is beer selection. I go to Big Dogs down the street if I'm feeling beer, but their menu at night is stripped down. If I feel bar food variety- I will head here.
Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop=After an unsuccessful Yelper excursion attempt to Pike's for late night desserts, I decided to stop by for lunch today instead. The atmosphere is interesting. It's casual and quaint, but set in a somewhat industrial styled brick building. Picture old wooden booths with coat hooks and large gilded mirrors set against a ceiling of exposed air ducts and dropped track lighting. We were greeted warmly at the door, guided to our table quickly and our orders were taken promptly. Their menu selection features traditional American favorites, some with Southern twists. Choose your own fixin's style burgers, meatloaf sandwiches, chicken tenders are just some of the selections. Their "made from scratch" soups caught my eye, but today's selection was potato bacon and sounded a little too heavy for my tastes. Our food was delivered within a reasonable time frame. My cheeseburger was good, somewhere between the mark of Five Guys and Penguin's. Fries were crisp, without the taste of old frying oil (my pet peeve). My husband's turkey burger was pretty tasty, seasoned with plenty of flavored seasoning salt. We finished lunch with the Tollhouse Pie, a chocolate chip cookie baked in a pie crust, topped with vanilla ice cream and fudge. It tasted just as I hoped. Warm, chocolaty, rich, but balanced by the ice cream - an American classic. My one criticism would be the restrooms which are in dire need of remodeling. I shudder if the old adage of judging a restaurant by their bathroom is really true. At any rate, the dining room atmosphere, food and dessert were all enjoyable.My family of 3 and I arrived today at Pike's for Sunday Brunch.  Upon arrival the 3 hosts informed us without a smile, eye contact, or any grace at all that the wait would be 15 minutes.  Another family arrived right after us and asked to be seated on the patio which was empty. While we waited beyond 30 minutes, 20 more people arrived all if whom were asked also to wait.  When it began to sprinkle outside I decided to look inside the restaurant. I was dismayed to see 6 open and cleared tables awaiting paying customers.  The wait staff were not working with any urgency at all and the 3 hostesses were certainly not at all interested in service.  My family and I left shortly after another family. Strictly from a business perspective why would Pike's pay 3 hosts to treat customers so poorly?  Alienating customers can easily be achieved by paying 1 host.  When I called and asked to speak to management I was told they were too busy to speak to me.  Pike's food does not warrant enduring such treatment. Pike's is not distinctively better than other choices in Charlotte. There is no reason to return and my family and I will not.Was just told by the manager that "walk-ins" were a higher priority over our reservation for 12 that was called in well in advance and then confirmed the night before.  We went to Big Ben's across the street. They served us immediately.  Going to Pike's to celebrate birthdays was my suggestion. A mistake I won't make again.
Glass Nickel Pizza=Overrated.  No, make that vastly overrated.There, I feel better, I needed to get that off my chest.When Glass Nickel Pizza burst on to the scene in the late '90s, they mopped the floor against weak-ass competition like Domino's, Pizza Pit and Rocky Rococo with their innovative topping combinations and fresh ingredients.  However, as local pizza market has evolved (enter Pizza Brutta, Salvatore's, Café Porta Alba, Grampa's, etc.), GNP was content to rest on their laurels.  Now it's GNP getting their butt handed to them by the new breed of pizzerias.  So word to the wise, ignore those "Best of Madison" accolades, they are based on past reputation and not current performance.The problems with GNP start with the crust - dense and largely flavorless, it overwhelms the other components of the pizza.  It's all chew and no crunch.  It also tends to be soggy in the middle, especially when you order vegetable or soft cheese toppings (yeah Fetalicious, I'm talking about you).  The tomato sauce is OK, not as bright as I would like and at times, a little too sweet.  Their pies could use more sauce to balance out all that bland crust.The quality of the cheese is a step below Madison's top tier pizza joints and a step above the Pizza Huts of the world.  Topping quantity varies from order to order. Sometimes GNP generously applies the toppings, while other times Scrooge McDuck seems to be in charge of the topping dispensing operation.If you handed me a slice of Glass Nickel Pizza, I'd certainly eat it, but it's not a destination for a great slice of pizza anymore.
Komol Restaurant=Shoutout to Lisa L and Eric R for dragging my husband and I to this place (and bringing a killer coupon no less). I had always been scared of this place due to all the vegetarian verbage that gets thrown around. Luckily their meat dishes are outstanding as well! Lisa L's description of the food was spot on. Everthing was quite tasty. Service was pretty spotty, but no major complaints there. Beer was reasonable and varied ($4 for chinese/thai imports, $3.50 for American beers) and overall the dinner was an insane value. With the coupon we spent $12.50 each for our 4 course meal + dessert + drinks. Without the coupon we still would have spent a meager $18.50 (with tax and tip!) each for that feast. Killer. Now for a little comparison amongst Komol and LOS for the die hard foodies who can't decide which to go to (Pin Kao doesn't come close to measuring up to either one!). Got Vegan/Veggie people with you? Definitely Komol, no questionValue oriented? KomolLooking to eat the basics (ie curry, pad see ew, etc): KomolSo why should anyone ever go to LOS? LOS is really for a more sophisticated palate. The food is infinitely more interesting ! The drunken seabass noodles (not found at Komol) and the soft shell prawns (not found at Komol) are my two favorites. Komol was great, but comparing LOS and Komol is kind of ridiculous. It's like comparing Mon Ami Gabi to Joel Robuchon. Both are French, but the food is just so completely different. Honestly it just depends if you're looking to try Thai like you've never had it, or are you looking for the basics done well at a great price. Komol serves the later.In a large yet hidden plaza rests Komol, a quaint Thai eatery with great lunch specials.  The interior is cozy, and covered in very pretty purple fake flowers.  The paintings on the walls and other knick-knacks all show a lot of Thai pride, and are set up quite well as to not clutter your dining experience.I came in with a friend for lunch on a Monday for the lunch specials.  There are many options, and all come with an egg roll, and a soup or salad.  Go with the salad, since the peanut sauce is AMAZING.  Just the right amount of sugar and salt.  The vegetable soup was bland and forgettable.   I ordered the Panang Curry with tofu, my friend got the Indian curry with chicken.  I asked for the Panang extremely spicy, but it came out mild.  The curry was a little chalky, and needed to be cooked a bit longer or needed more water.  The Indian curry was spicy and tasty.  The menu is very large, and I would come back to try a few more items, even though the ones I had were nothing special.  The biggest short coming of this place is the time it takes for your food to get to the table.  It wasn't busy at all, and we still waited a good twenty minutes after our soup/salad arrived.Lotus of Siam has nothing on Komol!!!! There I said it. I love Komol. It's clean and the food here has never let me down. I have been a fan for twenty years now. It is in my top 5 of favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas without a doubt. I've tried most of their chicken and veggie dishes, but the Panang Chicken is my shining star here. The consistency of the curry sauce is excellent. Generally smooth and not watery. The heat level of the sauce is also to my liking along with the balance of the meat to veggie ratio.  My only gripe is the dark meat. Ugh. Although it's more flavorful I try to eat healthier and Komol will not let me order all white meat. What's up with that? The food here is 5 stars without a doubt, but the service is about a 2 star for me. The young boys working seem to be more into internet porn than making sure I get my Thai Tea I ordered fifteen minutes ago. They are friendly when they do decide to shuffle on over to the table, but don't expect them to remove your dirty plates when you are done or get your check in a timely manner. Remember, internet porn comes first, customers second. As far as takeout goes they handle that shit! I highly recommend Komol if you are looking for authentic Thai on the east side of town.I can't stop the accolades that I give Komol. When my family comes into town, the only restaurant everyone wants to go to is Komol. No Michelin stars, no Food Network stars....just Komol. The food here is so dependable and we are all such regulars that the staff is almost like family. Deliciousness here includes:Tom Kha - the coconut milk-based broth is so rich and flavorful. You can customize the veggies/protein you want added. I like it simple with lots of broth, broccoli, cabbage and straw mushrooms. It's comfort in a bowlFried Corn - Corn and batter shaped into patties and served with a sweet sauce. Crispy. smooth and delicious. I can't put the experience of eating this dish into words!Papaya Salad - The papaya salad here is seriously kick-ass. It's got the right balance of sweetness and tartness and it complements the Thai meal beautifullyPad Thai - The Pad Thai here with fried tofu is a tad on the sweet side but I actually like it that way. The noodles are perfectly cooked and mushed together with fresh sprouts, crushed peanuts and the Pad Thai gravy to create an explosion in your mouthGinger Tofu - Slivered ginger, soft tofu (we ask for soft and not fried), vegetables all tossed in a light black sauce served with crispy Jasmine rice. Oh-so-good for you in all ways!Panang Curry - The Panang here has a huge following. The curry is extremely rich with the freshly ground spices spewing out of each spoonful. Eating the gravy with rice is an experience to be hadGarlic/Pineapple Fried Rice - Garlic for the spice and savory lover and Pineapple for the sweeter savory dish lover. Both dishes are excellent and really culminate an Asian meal.Komol is really the place for every lifestyle. With a plant-based menu as well as a meat-based menu you can count on anyone who has a tastebud to be in culinary heaven. Again, Komol is is one of the top 5 reasons for me staying in Las Vegas!This is an ABSOLUTE must go to if you are vegetarian.  It was just the drive from the southwest that prevented me from coming here sooner.  What a menu!  So many great sounding choices.  It was hard to narrow entrees down but it had already been decided pre-arrival that the herbal salad was a must order appetizer.  Thanks Lisa R for the raving about it.  What a tasty, crazy mix of stuff.  The #7 spice was a little over the top as it set my tongue ablaze but was a good burn for the wife.  I don't know what happened to my relationship with spicy food but it has cooled off considerably the last few years.  I guess I'm getting old.  I would've ordered a 10 spice a long time ago. I was worried since we ordered our curries with #7 spice thinking I would need to ask for a fire extinguisher.  I asked the waiter if I could get a 4 or 5 for the Kang-Ped Delight I ordered.  He said "No problem" but the only problem was that the server had our curries right behind him!  Thankfully the coconut milk made it taste like a 5.The Kang-Ped Delight certainly was all that!  The curry had bamboo shoots, tofu, zucchini, baby corn, straw mushrooms, snow peas, carrots and hot peppers, cooked in red curry sauce with coconut milk.  It was probably the best Thai curry I've had in recent memory.  I added soy chicken for $2 and it made this killer.  The best fake chicken I've ever tasted.  How did they do it?  I can't wait to try their soy duck and shrimp on future visits.Komol, you no doubt deserve the bump up to FIVE STARS. I eat you at least once a week and have been coming here since I was 16. I've never been dissatisfied with the food. Not one bad dish in all that time. I cannot say that about any other restaurant. Also, the service has been stepped up a notch too, so thank you for that. Trust me, all the food is excellent here, but these are the dishes I always order:Tom KhaNum TokPanang BeefGarlic Pepper beef/chickenHerbal Salad- I dream about this FYI1. When you go to Komol if you say HOT they will make it HOT for you. Don't try to wear the Daddy pants if you don't have a belt if ya' know what I mean.2.  Even though the service has been much better recently I still recommend letting your server know if you are on a tight time schedule. They will do their best to accommodate you.Thank you Komol for the 20 years of flavorful dishes you have made for me and all of the memories I've made around your dinner tables.Komol has been on my radar for about a year and I finally stopped in Wednesday evening.  I knew from looking at the menu online that I wanted to try a duck dish.  I ordered the duck chili mint - boneless duck stir fried with garlic, hot peppers, and basil.  After reading the Yelp reviews of people I know, I opted for a spiciness level of 6 out of 10.  It turned out to be just about perfect considering the dish was spiced with red chilis and several slices of fresh jalapeño.  Tasty indeed but not overwhelming.For dessert, I ordered the pumpkin in coconut milk.  It was fresh pumpkin cubes in sweetened and warmed coconut milk.  Very good!Service was excellent.  When I asked the server about the size of a cup of soup, he told me it's generally too big for one person--people often split it--and I opted to skip having soup.  It was early and the restaurant was quiet, but everyone who works there was cheerful, greeted me, and had a big smile.Thanks for the tips, Misti, Mamie, Holly, and Paolo!I have to go back and try some more.  It is good!Thank you Yelp for helping me realize there were restaurants not called Lotus of Siam or Namaste in the Sahara Pavilion.   Thank you again for giving me the blueprint to ordering what I ultimately ordered from the giant encyclopedia set that apparently is the menu that they present to you at Komol.  "I don't see the herbal salad"   "Oh, check the Vegetarian section, page 23 on volume 2" We started with the Yelp heralded Herbal salad and got it brought to the table sort of as an appetizer.   One of my favorite new dishes of 2012 by far.  Yes, a dish consisting of fruits, veggies, tofu, cashews is one of the best new things I've eaten in the last 8 months.  This should be the moment I just bow out of the whole Yelping experience altogether.  DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY BEEF AND PORK DISHES I'VE EATEN DURING THIS TIME SPAN?   Okay, settling down.   So yeah, Herbal Salad: freaking amazing.  Next.   Vegetarian Pad Thai (Tofu).   Enjoyed the flavor on this, but it didn't really seem any different than other versions I've had.  Still worth ordering if you're a big fan of Pad Thai I guess, as I usually am not.   Then we had the Chili Mint Chicken, which I liked a lot.  Ground up chicken sauteed with garlic. hot peppers and basil.  Pretty standard fare for a thai restaurant, but done exceptionally well.  Lastly I had to try the much raved about Panang Curry with beef.   I was actually slightly disappointed in this considering due to reviews I was expecting angels to descend through the ceiling and bless my lips and tongue after each bite.  That being said, it was delicious even sans angels.  It had a smokier flavor than I'm used to having from pretty much any curry I've ever had.  I appreciated the large bowl of sticky rice they also provided the table which was great at soaking up the curry and whatever other juices or bits and pieces the other dishes left on the plate.  The only item I didn't enjoy was the non-dairy coconut ice cream I ordered at the end.  I didn't really expect it to be good because let's be honest, non-dairy ice cream just by principle isn't right.   The flavor was okay on it but texture-wise I wasn't a fan.   Little chunks of coconut were present and the overall texture was almost grainy, not smooth.   With so many amazing entree plates preceding it, I didn't really mind this mild disappointment.This hole-in-wall spot gets five stars from me because they're tasty, affordable, and  give you a hefty portion of food for a great price. Mainly, I'm talking about their lunch menu. Not only is your main course gargantuas but you get soup and an egg roll too! Hellz yes!  I'm that easy to be won over but the added bonuses aren't all that I love from this place. Comparing Kohmol's lunch menu to anywhere else, these guys provide you with a wide selection for vegetarians and the normal carnivore eater.  Service is some times slow but always genuine and friendly. I've had the pangang tofu and spicy eggplant dishes. Both were excellent and flavorful. As far as prices, deliciousness, and portions are concerned, this is the place that has me at lunch specials.I recently went on a date where the other person had some dietary restrictions. I was a little worried because I am a human garbage disposal. I eat everything. Sometimes you come across places that are vegetarian and it definitely feels like it is. As a person that enjoys meat, I did not miss it one bit when it came to Komol.The Vegetarian Platter: was a bountiful fest of lightly battered fried spinach, sweet potatoes, eggplant, and tofu. It reaffirms that you can fry anything and it would be amazing.The Chicken Noodle Soup: was just that. Nothing special, but it was welcomed on this cold day. No I am not talking about my experience on the date right now.The Herbal Salad: was everything everyone raves about and more. I loved the crispy fried tofu skins mixed in to give it more texture. The dish does not lack in that department or in flavor.The Vegetarian Delight Curry: was good. The eggplants, green beans, and tofu in a rich broth could have used more of a kick. We ordered it mild in case they actually went Asian hot on us. Instead it was definitely not made for someone who likes a kick.There was just so much food in the end. I am still in shock by the serving size here. The service was minimal, but since I was trying to get to know the person across from me, I was happy they only stopped by to drop my food and refill the waters.Arrived for dinner on a Sunday evening which is unusual for me BC I usually dine here during the week. I was shocked how busy they were - the dinning room was totally filled but I lucked out and secured the last booth before the waiting list began.I heart the vegetarian options Komol offers, although I'm not vegan. I chose a vegan combo dinner which was only $10.95 that included mushroom Tom Kha soup, spring roll and veggie pad Thai. The food was tasty and filling and can understand why Komol is doing so well!Komol will continue to be my go to place for Thai food in Las Vegas.Chili Mint Chicken - medium heat, a side salad with ginger dressing and an egg roll, and if I'm having a stressful day a glass of Chai Tea. While Thai food gives one ample opportunities to try something new, sometimes you just want comfort food. When that's what I need my car finds it's way to Komol for lunch, and for over a year now I get the comfort food I crave. Now once in a while they have an off day and I grumble about it, but a return trip always ends up with things going right again. I quickly realize how lucky I am to know of this wonderful place in the shadow of their overrated and over priced competitor that's right across the parking lot. You can't go wrong eating at Komol. It's family run, they take care of their customers, and the food is consistently great. (I just realized as I was writing this that my first visit to Komol was 6/20/2012...and since that time I've been there at least 30 times. My feet and my debit card keep coming back...really what other endorsement speaks louder than repeat patronage!). Back to 5 Stars. Seriously...they've earned it. (Plus if Jessie B or Jaime W. recommend it, it's always good...this was a Jessie B. recommendation that I'm so glad I listened to!)It is with a heavy heart that I downgrade my beloved Komol.  I loved the place so much that I had been looking past all the slip-ups the last few months, but I finally decided enough was enough.  If I had the same experience the first time I visited, I would have never come back.Since at least December, things have been falling apart.  Many times the food quality just wasn't there; the herbal salad was missing all the flavor it used to have or the tofu was fried into something unrecognizable.  Orders were put in wrong.  And every single time the service was just non-existent.  The servers are still friendly enough, but there were times we waited well over 40 minutes for our food to come out or 15 minutes for a check.  Once we were in the restaurant for two hours just trying to have a simple, quick dinner.And please, let's just put it out there: the place is in need of a good scrubbing.I still love you, Komol, but you need some time to work on you.After hearing so much hype about this place, I eventually made my way to Sahara and Commercial to finally give it a try.  On my first visit we ordered drunken noodles (pad kee mao) with chicken to go. She told us 15 minutes, but it was closer to 30 and the restaurant was empty. The chicken was minced/ground which was a bit unusual from what I am used to. The flavor was fine and the ingredients were quality, but it was not amazing nor did it warrant rushing back there. I decided I would try this place again before I wrote a review. A week or so ago, I went back because I was in the field and was in the nearby area. I met another friend for lunch and we gave their lunch special a try. I had their panang curry lunch special that came with an eggroll, rice and a soup of the day for $7.95. The soup was pretty bland with vegetable and tofu. The curry was fine, but not unlike Panang curry I have tried at plenty of other Thai joints. I had spicy 7/10 and I'd say to me more realistically it was like a 5/10. The service was very spotty and inconsistent. You can tell the wait staff started to get overwhelmed when the lunch rush hour began. But to be fair, they were pretty slow when it was just two tables in the joint.. The restaurant appears clean with interesting traditional Thai decor. The menu's have wooden covers which is a cool touch. I would probably try this place again if in the area and craving Thai, but I wouldn't drive here from home. This is a perfect example of a place being hyped up.WHO: The hungry people craving delicious Thai food!! They are Vegetarian friendly as well, so don't be SKURRED!!WHEN: Monday through Saturday, 11am-10pm; Sunday, 12pm-10pmWHERE: It is located in the Korean plaza on Sahara & Commercial.WHAT: I have been to this restaurant about 3 plus times and they never fail to make me a happy customer. Happy customers = favorites = telling other fellow yelpers = Komol has more favorites to serve! Lol.Whenever I come in, I am always delightfully greeted at the door, and then shown to my seat. One of my favorite things is the WOODEN MENUS. Too cute!... Inside these wooden menus, are delicious foods you may choose from: (the ones I've tried are as follows).1. Herbal Salad: my favorite salad in the entire GALAXY! This salad is definitely out of this world. I do not know what they do to it, but they are definitely DOING IT RIGHT!! This is a must have as soon as you are seated!2. Panang Curry: This dish is one of my favorites at every singly Thai restaurant, but their panang curry has got me hooked! I don't know how else to explain it, but it's just the blending of the spices, plus chicken or tofu = mm mm GREAT!3. Green Curry: As you can tell, I am a sucker for Thai curry! It is just absolutely TASTY! This also will have you asking for a second order!I am definitely going back for more as soon as possible. Get your car keys, hop in that car of yours, and head to Komol now! (Herbal Salad is a must! ;) ) HURRYYYY!!A strong 4 stars!...and the best Thai restaurant in Commercial Center! I met a delightful Yelper here for dinner.  We took Nelson Q's advice on going with the Herbal Salad to start.  This was crisp, fresh and different (the good/refreshing different, not the searching for a modifier different.)  We were fans of the Salad, the lemongrass, fresh herbs and fried tofu.   Spice level was 5/10 and played nice with the acidity of the salad.  My point?...you should order this salad.We also ordered Pork Pad Kee Mao and Veggie Panang Curry--wish I had read Cathy C's review that you can ask for items a little hotter here than you might at other Thai Restaurants.  The curry was a little thicker than usual...nice texture, felt a little love put into it...anytime you feel a little of the love that goes in to something that's good right?...yeah, it is!  The Pad Kee Mao was a little less flavorful than the other items, but this was the only dish we ordered mild...don't be like us...get them all at or near your maximum heat level!...added some chili flake and pepper sauce afterwards and was much better--not just heat wise, but for another level of flavor.  They do a great job here with their Pad Thai as well.The restaurant itself is rather nice inside.  You can easily forget that you are in commercial center.  We also appreciated the signs on restrooms.  A heart of the lades chest (assuming because women love with their hearts) and a heart over the males gentiles (assuming because men love with their...,) nice and direct?...I liked it.I have long since stopped trying to find the best Thai in Vegas.  There is a different favorite for each Thai dish that I typically get.  I would definitely come before I would go to any hyper popular Thai spot in the same center!  Additionally though Komol has earned a spot with me for their Herbal Salad.Inconsistent service seems to be what Komol is serving up lately. At the time I write this I'm currently holding the Duke status on the Yelp app from all my check-ins. And I've been a fan of Komol for almost 2 years now. Service over that time has seen some rough spots but my visit today was a first: I walked out without having been served the main part of my order. A little backstory... While Komol has an extensive menu with great offerings like their curries and vegetarian fare it's the Chili Mint Chicken that's my comfort food of choice. I've ordered it so much that most of the staff knows my order...they don't even have to hand me a menu. So yes I know Komol, and when they are on their game they totally blow away their competition across the parking lot. But then you get days like today where you ask for an extra egg roll and never get it. Or it takes them 35+ minutes to attempt to put out a simple plate of Chili Mint Chicken that can normally be done in under half the time. I understand the place gets busy or they have called in orders. But I've been there when the place was even busier and didn't see the delay I had today. And what makes it even more frustrating is my last visit was perfect in almost every way. But the visit before that was almost as bad as today...and this is all in the past 2 weeks. Thankfully there is a McDonalds down the street so a quick unhealthy Big Mac, fries, and a sweet tea kept me from going back to work hungry. But now that I no longer have an empty stomach I wonder how can I get a message across to the Komol staff that their service needs to improve? The only option I have is to drop some stars...and express my frustration where it will get noticed and hopefully acted upon. Come on Komol....fix this mess. Until they make some changes...yeah, Eek! Me thinks not, one star territory seems appropriate. It's harsh...but then again I didn't feel so hot leaving hungry either.5 stars for the food! 3 stars for everything else.. This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!I had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.When we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously. Food wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that. The spice level that we asked for in each dish was exactly on point, something that has never happened to me except at LoS. That says a lot.Herbal Salad - believe the hype, for it is real. This is a *must order* item! I don't know if this their signature dish, but it should be. It's a very unassuming plate.. but aren't a lot of great dishes the same way? After taking in that first spoon, it was love at first bite. The textures were amazing. Apples, crunchy tofu, lemongrass, and much, much more. I'll leave it to you guys who've never tried it, to experience it for yourselves. You won't regret it.Drunken noodles - they killed it here as well. I was mystified how they were able to add all that flavor into each rice noodle. It's pretty crazy. It was as if the sauce and spices were made into the noodles. A stunner!Mango sticky rice - the mango was perfectly ripe, and tasted how a real mango should taste like. The sticky rice was sticky-icky! It also wasn't cloyingly sweet, and complimented the mango brilliantly. Another winner!The panang curry and tom yum soup were excellent and items that I would highly recommend!But, like in many operations, service kind of destroyed a great meal. Our server was gracious, kind, and helpful. But asking two servers to run a full restaurant, taking orders, running their food, and bussing their tables is just asinine. I know that the business is trying to cut costs, but as the great Chris Carter says "C'mon, man!"Service aside, I would happily come back here because the food is that good. I shall see you on that flip side!Komol used to be one of my personal Best of Las Vegas favorites...and a weekly lunch stop for me. But that changed when I've sat there for lunch and spent 45 minutes waiting for food that never arrived and I ended up walking out more than once. Their Chili Mint Chicken is good, the Panang Curry...is wonderful. And to be honest they totally blow away the overhyped Northern Thai place right across the parking lot with 4x the number of Yelp reviews. But I'm not coming back to Komol for awhile. I hope the ownership of Komol can take some time to work on handling large groups. Yes, having several tables full of Zappos people is good for business. But when you can't find the time to bring one glass of Thai tea, an eggroll, and a plate of Panang Curry out to one of your regulars...you've got some problems. The place could use some spiffing up too, and they've been playing the same piped in music so long I can tell when the music is going to start over again. 1 Star. I don't want special service, just take my order and bring me my food and don't make me late getting back to work. I don't think that's asking too much.
Rincon De Buenos Aires=Did somebody say meat? Argentina...the home of Messi and great steaks with chimichurri, how can I resist Rincon De BA?Located along Spring Mountain somewhere in Chinatown, you'll find this unassuming place.  It's in the same complex as Cafe de Japon and Cathay House.  They have a few tables and there was only 1 server when we went here - he did try his best to provide good service to all the diners so I can't fault him for that.We were given a basket of bread with an amazing cup of chimuchurri on the side.  That's it, end of review!  But wait, I still have to share the other fantastic parts of the meal.  We had the empanadas (a beef, a chicken and a spinach) which were yummy.  I liked the chicken empanada the most.  The crust wasn't as crisp as the Spanish empanadas I'm used to but the filling was great.  We also got the parrillada Martin Fierro (short ribs, filet mignon, skirt steak and flap meat) with a side of papas fritas de provenzal (garlic fries).  The meats were so tender, juicy and packed with flavor then dip it in chimichurri?  Oh my goodness!  Intense tastebud experience!  The papas fritas were warm, crisp and garlicky.For dessert I finished a mixto flan by myself.  The syrupy flan kind of looks strange but it's good.  It came with a side of crema chantilli and dulce de leche.  Eating the flan wih the dulce de leche was divine!This Real Madrid fan gives Rincon De Buenos Aires 5 stars (even though Messi's our rival)!I have driven by Rincon countless times and was amused by the name in big letters and below a small sign saying Italian deli.  It didn't seem to go together, but I get it now.  They have more than just Argentinian food but that's the highlight.  It's the corner storefront of this U shaped shopping plaza in Chinatown, hence the name.I came here with a friend for a late morning lunch and we ordered and shared many items from the menu.  We were brought some bread and chimichurri.  The spices in the chimichurri were very good and went well on the bread and some meat we had later on.We started with an order of provoletta--grilled provolone cheese topped with chili and the chimichurri spices.  We took our knives and dug in and pulled up some cheese that hung like melted cheese will.  I put the cheese on my bread.  Vary tasty and great start.  We then got the order of three empanadas--one ham and cheese, one chicken, and one corn and cheese.  All three were good.  I liked the chicken the most.  The crust was flaky and thin.  The amount of filling for the three was perfect.Then came the main course--a Parrillada Argentina, a mixture of grilled meat.  Ours consisted of three sausages, sweet bread, skirt steak, and short ribs.  It was perfect for sharing.  We each had a length of short rib, one white sausage each, we shared the one black sausage (blood sausage or blood pudding are two names for it) and we each had a skirt steak.  We got all the meat cooked medium.  The skirt steak was a little tough but it was tasty.  The chimichurri added to the meat.  The grilled meats were really very good.  My favorite here was the blood sausage.  It's the first time I've had it and it was quite good.Then we ordered four desserts to share--dulce de leche flan, an alfajor, a Mil Hojas, and a pasta frola.  While all four were excellent, I had two favorites here--the mil hojas and the alfajor.  I'd had an alfajor once before and it was good to have this sweet cookie once again and the mil hojas had a great filling of chocolate and the spice, which we couldn't quite place was cardamon our server told us.  The flan was very soft and the pasta frola--quince tart--was also quite good.  Service was great!  Our server was a delightful young woman who answered questions and always had a pleasant smile.  She refilled our water glasses several times.A great meal with a good friend--that's what Saturdays are for--or any other day of the week ending in y.
Cafe Heidelberg German Market & Restaurant=Exploring the city's German fare, the BF and I headed over to Cafe Heidelberg the past Friday evening.  Upon entering, the waitress looked at us and then the clock.  I asked if they were closing and she said no, but we had five minutes to order.  (I guess the last seating is definitely at 8 pm.)Walking past the small market and into the back, we seated ourselves into a quaint little booth.  A bunch of older folks filled the other tables and you get the feeling that this is definitely a family kind of place.  (Hofbrauhaus and Cafe Heidelberg are in two totally different leagues.)The waitress handed us the menus and a beverage list.  The food menu is very basic, nothing fancy at all.  And the beverage list has a decent variety of beers and wine.  I wanted spatzle, and that's all I cared about.  So I ordered one of the few things that came with spatzle - the Jagerschnitzel ($23), "Pork schnitzel lightly battered and smothered in a mushroom , wine and onion sauce.  Paired with red cabbage and spatzel."The BF was torn between the Mixed Wurst Plate ($23), "Bratwurst, Knackwurst, and Bockwurst.  Served on a bed of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes," and the Oktoberfest Platter ($25), "A classic pork schnitzel and a jumbo Bratwurst paired perfectly with red cabbage and homemade spatzle."  He chose the former since I already had the pork schnitzel and spatzle in my dish.As we waited for our entrees, bread and butter arrived with our beverages.  We also took a little walk through the market to check out their German groceries and deli.  A limited choice of food items, but you'll find your herring, spatzel, and sauerkraut available here for home.My pork schnitzel was covered with dark brown gravy and was quite tender.  Pretty good.  The spatzel was okay, but maybe it's because I prefer it with a creamier sauce instead, like mushroom.  (I think I should have ordered the Kase Spatzle ($16), "House recipe German noodles smothered with melted Swiss cheese.  Garnished with tomatoes," instead.)  The red cabbage was blah, nothing special but the side salad was pretty tasty.  The BF's wurst feast came with a side of mustard sauce for dipping and a huge helping of sauerkraut.  The different wursts were pretty good and the sauerkraut was okay.  (Then again, I think I'm a fan of it on the colder end and crunchy than soggy.)They were both very generous orders and we had leftovers to go.  We never made it to dessert which was "Bavarian Apple Strudel with vanilla sauce" ($7) and "Black Forest Cherry Cake" ($5).  Overall, Cafe Heidelberg may probably be more authentic German fare than Hofbrauhaus.  They were recently voted "Best of Las Vegas" for "Other Ethnic Restaurant" again.  So, if you want your German fix, head on over to Cafe Heidelberg, just don't expect the loud music, crazy games, and the long wait of its competitor.(I added pics of our dinner in the business profile!)
Denny's=It's Denny's. It has food. It's really cheap if you order off the $2/$4/$6 menu.I wouldn't recommend it, although the service was fine, but then again, getting eight people to agree on anything that early when they're hungover leads to some Denny's  type experiences.So go, just know it'll be just like the last time you went to Denny's.This is my favorite place to go when I want a home cooked meal. Been going here my whole life, and I'll say it's my favorite place for comfort food.The chef never disappoints, he's on par!Thank you so much!
Pete's Fish & Chips=Been awhile since I had some fish and chips. This place has been my stopover for some good ol' fish and chips craving. The sauce here really compliments the chips. A fine place for satisfying yourself with good food from Pete's fish & chips.
Grant Bar=When Rick Sebak says it's a good place to go, you go! So I went, and while the food may not have blown me away, the pies are totally worth the drive here!You can totally tell this is a spot that sees repeat costumers day in and out. We had an early dinner at 5pm and it was packed with families and couples. The decor reminds you of a ski chalet, it's quite cozy. All you needed is a roaring fireplace!We read the reviews about the battered shrimp, so we started off with that as an app. They were very good, and I believe that breadcrumb family recipe is legit. Plus, the cocktail sauce was surprisingly good. But the main dishes we split, between the rainbow trout, almondine cod and seafood platter were a little bland. The real treat is the pies, as I stated earlier. Most are cream pies, offering their famous coconut cream pie, but also banana cream, chocolate cream and an apple pie, among other choices... I kinda zoned out after my excitement set in for the coconut pie. It was light and fluffy and delicious, just like you'd expect it to be. Toasted coconut flakes just topped it off. I hear the owner bakes a bunch of pies in the morning and you get what you get by the end of the day, so I was glad to enjoy the coconut one! While I probably wouldn't be back for dinner, I'd definitely be back for a slice of pie... or the whole pie!
Lindos Restaurant=My breakfast literally had to be served on three separate plates.  For the second time in a row I got the breakfast scrambler. I doubled checked with the waitress, "Do you get pancakes and French toast with the scrambler?" To which she replied ,"Yes."  I can hardly believe you get two eggs, home fires bacon or sausage, pancakes and French toast for $7.99.It's been so long since I have ordered a meal where the difference between cost of raw materials/ingredients and cost of meal were so small.  This happened one other place recently and that would Sushi Fuku in Oakland.Eating this terrific cheap breakfast came the morning after eating an $18.00 buffalo chicken macaroni from Six Penn.  I'm still a little ashamed of that.Lindos Restaurant filled both my heart and my tummy.
Hinsons Drive-In=I have driven by Hinson's numerous times, it has a fluorescent hot dog in the window and it's beside a cement building strip club that just reads: TOPLESS. Always catches my eye.I remember reading about Hinson's in last year's burger bracket. This week was the day I tried it!The chili and slaw is made in house, he had a bbq sandwich special the day, I was with one of my friends so we ordered a bbq sandwich, hot dog and a hamburger, I wanted to try EVERYTHING!!!  I ordered a jalapeno burger, he put pickled jalapenos on the grill before he placed them on the burger!  I watched him make all the food, he makes every sandwich with care.The hot dog won my vote, it was piping hot and I asked him to cook it well done, it was perfect.  My French fry barometer registered a sexy whistle because I thought I was at the strip club.  The French fries were so hot, you had to let them cool, even dipping them in ketchup didn't work.. hot, hot, hot!Phil, the only employee who was there told me they have karaoke on the first Friday of every month, dare I say?????  Let's go?On the list for off the beaten path, authentic, unique to Charlotte lunch stop..
Red Rock Pizza=I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to check it out.  Today I stopped for some lunch.  As I pulled up to the restaurant, I noticed the sign in front of the joint that said "2 Slices & Soda $5.95".....perfect!I asked the guy at the counter if the 2 Slice Special is more or less Pizza than a Personal 10" Pizza....he said the 2 Slice Special has more Pizza, so I went with it.  The special price is for Cheese only, to add more toppings it's $.50 ea, so I decided to add Pepperoni & Sausage to both slices.....total damage $6.95.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=Z2zzt8zXaQBX8doxb9-58gI then grabbed a Soda out of the beverage cooler, they have Coke Zero, score!  I'm not much of a Soda drinker, but there are 4 Sodas I have a tough time saying no to.....Mexican Coke or Pepsi, Pepsi Max, and Coke Zero.  I swear they put liquid Crack in Coke Zero!After a short wait, my Pizza was ready.  The Crust is slightly thicker than a NY Style Pizza and you must fold the Pizza if you want to eat it properly, otherwise you'll have to use a knife and a fork....which is a Sin!  I took one bite and thought the Pizza was really good.  The Pepperoni was great, quality stuff.  The Sausage was pretty good, but not great......was missing "something".  The Pizza had the perfect proportion of ingredients.....the Cheese or Sauce didn't overwhelm the Pizza.....which is a common mistake at some Pizza joints.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg?select=wjkjIIETK87tO8549L0MaQOverall, I thought it was really good Pizza.  I was left wanting more.....I could have easily eaten another 2 Slices......next time I'm ordering a Medium for myself...ha!I noticed their sign that said their Wings were Baked, not Fried.....heard from Matt S that it's some of the best Wings in town.....have to try that next time!Return Factor - 90%I stopped by here for lunch and tried out their lunch special, 2 slices of cheese and a 20 ounce bottled soda for $5.95 including tax. There were 3 employees inside when I walked in who all greeted me and were very nice. They have tables inside and a TV. I sat at a table while my food was being prepared and it wasn't long before it was ready. I also asked for a "Cannoli" priced at $3.25 to be packed to-go and it was made fresh to order. The pizza was just so-so to me. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. The price was certainly right! The Cannoli was actually very good and one of the best I have had. Those alone are worth stopping by for.They offer delivery to a wide range of the valley.Cliffs Notes: I live in Summerlin, and this is by far the best pizza delivery option. My go to favorites are the Widowmaker and the BBQ chicken but I often split a onion/garlic/sausage/pepperoni with a friend at work for lunch. Full ReviewSo this place is obviously not Pizza Rock quality, but I don't think anyone could expect that from a residential delivery place. If you are a pizza snob this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a step up over Pizahut/Dominos kind of place than this is great. Some notes on the PizzaPrice wise this place is about 75-100% more expensive than your average delivery chain for just about everything- pizza, drinks, wings etc. A few reviews have raved about the "fresh ingrediants"- this is not exactly true. Their sauce comes out of a jar, I have never seen anyone slicing vegetables etc- they seem to use your run of the mill restaurant supply ingrediants. I wouldn't really expect anything different for the price but if you are a fresh food fenatic you may be dissapointed.Delivery times- I live 2 miles from the place, I work about 500 feet from it. Delivery takes about 45 minutes to an hour whereas pickup takes 20 minutes so I would highly suggest picking it up to avoid getting the pizza past its prime. Wings- I love chicken wings and these are perfectly passable delivery wings given that we have no dedicated wing joint in summerlin. They are baked not fried which does negate the crispness a little but not too much.Garlic knots- yes these are pretty good. You get 1-2 with your pizza depending on the size, would recommend getting a side order to avoid fights to the death in a situation of GK scarcity.
Jozsa Corner=This place is so unique which is why I'm giving it 5 stars.  You do need a minimum number of people so make sure you call ahead to get the deets on that.  It's like being invited to a friend's house where they are making you a home cooked Hungarian meal!  I wasn't really sure what Hungarian food consisted of before making my way here but there's noodles, meat, cabbage and bread involved.  Oh the bread - it seriously came right out of the oven on to our table in to our mouths - it was PERFECT!  The place is BYOB and is very casual and cash only.  So make sure you bring some good company, bottles of wine and cash!  The owner is extremely sweet and will talk you through the dishes if you have questions.
Lapko's Bar & Grill=My favorite part about Allegheny County isn't the big chain locations and fancy brand new spots (though I'll try anything once), but it's the places that give us our unique something from nothing flavor not found nowhere else and Lapko's, is one of those locations that lives up to that.If Cheers was still on the air this is what it would be like.  Original Tin ceiling, vintage memorabilia, old school charm looking to add in some new school style.  A pool table and to my surprise one of those table top bowling games (this is the place for some great Instagram pics).  I didn't eat but they serve food also, probably next time.  If 8th and the Water Front continue to dedicate itself to revitalization I believe this place could survive long through another era of A homestead boom.  I could kinda see Homestead creating its own SouthSide esque.If you are fresh in town, looking for somewhere new to add to your untapped account, or always stay here yet never been, I'd suggest giving this place a visit.
Diamond Restaurant=I was lucky enough to be able to check The Diamond out for their soft opening last night and from what I can tell they are geared up and ready to rock Plaza Midwood's socks off.The fried pickles and burgers are just as good as (if not better than) I remembered them from around the corner. Rest assured, all your old favorites are here. But the menu also has a lot of delicious newcomers. I opted to go with the meatball parm sub. The meatballs and sauce were both nicely seasoned and the cheese was melted to stringy deliciousness on the top. Don't expect a side of fries, but hey, there are enough delicious sides available to order (ex: crab dip, pig wings, fried pickles, etc.) that you won't miss the "plate" style combination.The inside has been redesigned in a way that can only be classified as kitschy-chic. Bright blue vinyl booths (though there aren't a whole ton of them so keep wait times in mind when if you go right after they open), oversized utencil art, and vintage wallpaper all await you inside The Diamond along side a lot of familiar faces.I want to see how they run with a full crowd and sink my teeth into some more of the sizable menu before I go tossing around a fifth star, but so far it looks like The Diamond is ready to knock it out of the park!There is some magic in the air about The Diamond, first of all the restaurant has been around Charlotte since 1945, it's kitchy and cozy.  The guys who took it over, polished it up without overdoing it or making it too cool for school.  It is packed tightly with tables, I don't remember it being so compact on my last visit, but it works.The powder, deep, robin's egg, Tiffany box.... blue vinyl booths give me a hard on.  I didn't know I was going to the Diamond on this sneak peek night, but Julia S. and the Mister texted me, so I headed over.  Since I wasn't hungry, I just ate a Winky Dinky dog and a shit ton of their french fries smoothered with pimento cheese and vegetarian gravy.  Jeez Louise.  I wonder what I would have consumed if I were hungry. Har, har, har.  Really, I don't even like gravy on my french fries and I could not stop eating.The Winky Dinky dog was served on a split top white bread bun, sent straight from white bread forbidden hell and it was delicious.  It really tasted like it was fried and finished on the grill, complete with the grill taste-   4th of July when you were a kid kinda taste, topped with chili and pimento cheese.  I added raw onion and yellow mustard and called it a day.I checked my Magic Eight Ball for the Diamond's future. Will The Diamond succeed?  It is decidedly so.Oh Diamond.  I have been waiting and waiting and waiting and, well you get the point.  The fried pickles are exactly the same as the Penguin's.  The burgers are dryer & crunchy on the outside, not as good as they used to be.  I really like the addition of the vegetables, I got mac & cheese which was good but lacked oomph & the sweet potato fries were tasty but kind of dry without something to dip them in.  I definitely want to come back (months from now when it's died down!) & try some of the greek food.  They were out of most of it when we went.  now, here is where my love for The Diamond stops.  I am not kidding when I say that it was the worst service i've ever had.  Our server was awful, it took ages to take our order & she got it wrong.  She was also sick (sneezing into her elbow, wiping her nose), pretty gross.  It took her 30 minutes after we were seated to take our order, our fried pickle appetizer took 45 minutes to appear (by then I was ready to chew my arm off!), my order was wrong & they forgot part of another order.  Cut to the end of the meal & we were informed that the internet was down & they couldn't take credit cards. We were told it would be a few minutes.  15 minutes pass, still can't pay, a new set of customers have already taken over our table and we're still waiting.  another 15-20 minutes pass and we still can't pay.  We had to send someone to the Common Market to get cash because the wait was getting ridiculous.  Our server informed us when we asked if they had any other way to take credit cards or if the manager would comp our meal for waiting 45 to pay told us we were being uncool.  They did eventually cut our bill in half.   I know The Penguin's thing was to have not so friendly waitresses, but at least they were unfriendly and efficient, she was just rude.  I really really wanted to love The Diamond, but I won't be going near it for a few months.  They have a lot of kinks to work out.There has been a whole lotta buzz about the Diamond in recent weeks, hasn't there? And no, I'm not going to hash out a review about their history and challenges that resulted in the final product...y'all can research that yourself. I'm here to talk about the food! And the service :)After waiting it out a few weeks, hubs and I finally rolled into the Diamond at 6:15 pm on a Monday night in hopes of avoiding an astronomical wait. And, cha-ching! No waiting. Our server Jason got to us pretty quickly and set us up in a booth with drinks within minutes. The interior of the Diamond is really great - shiny, vinyl booths, kitschy wallpaper, sweet sized bar near the back. I really dig the color scheme - the place looks wonderful.A couple things to note...they were out of many items. I realize they are still going through some kinks and, unfortunately, it shows. The menu is quite large and I can only imagine how tough it's been to gauge inventory with long lines and a hefty menu. Since a good deal of the pent up anxiety about the Diamond revolves around the food, here's what I indulged in & how it fared:Fried pickles: 3.5/5: Tasty slices of pickle-y love & a very generous portion - even for a half size. Yes, that's $3.95 for a boatload of fried pickles. These little babies came out piping hot with a side of ranch. My only gripe? The breading was pretty plain and the ranch was fairly thin. A little spice would kick this dish right up to 5 stars for me. My meal: I chose the quarter fried chicken plate, a steal with two sides and your choice of biscuit, cornbread or yeast roll. While I was yearnin' for some cornbread, they were out of it. *cries* Oh well, I went with a biscuit, green beans and a baked sweet potato. Fried chicken: 4.5/5: This rivals my grandma's fried chicken. Crispy, hot, perfectly seasoned with just a touch of grease. Hey - it's fried chicken...a little grease is good. The meat was juicy tender and freakin' delicious. Green beans: 1/5: I barely stuffed two beans in my mouth. These tasted straight out of the can with a pound of salt added. Serves me right for ordering a non-fried veg. Baked sweet potato: 4/5: Yes. It was a baked sweet potato! No butter required. Biscuit: 3/5: A good biscuit, not a great one. I have to admit that I compared this biscuit to Dish's and it just didn't quite measure up. Nevertheless, the Diamond swings a soft biscuit and it went well with the fried bird on my plate. I vacillated between 3 & 4 stars for the Diamond, but ultimately went with 4 stars because of the value you get from the food, the fun & vibrant ambiance and overall potential. I'll be back!Chill atmosphere, decent vegan options and moderate prices; why did it take me so long to visit?The Diamond has lots of local drama drama in how it came to be (and how The Penguin came to suck). For more reading! Look at others' reviews or google it.Now to focus on the place itself: comfy booths, dim lighting, and very popular to the alternative-sort of people without Charlotte. This place is one of the Must-Go's in Plaza Midwood.The food is as diner traditional as they can get (while still adding a modern flourish). I have the Jumbo Soy Dog which came with meatless chili, mustard, onions and coleslaw on it. I was pretty impressed and quite happy.Even though much of the menu is barred off to do due to my veganism and hatred of greasy food, I'll definitely be back!"Won't get fooled again!!!" I had been prior to the change, and now after---and this place still has a long way to go. If you're looking for Penguin 2.0, don't be fooled. The menu items are similar, the classic favorites are there (Big Bloc burgers, Pimento cheese, fried pickles, etc.), although I feel the attention to detail isn't quite taken as seriously. Sanitation score could use an upgrade as well....91.5? That's pretty borderline.I feel like they're still struggling to find their identity as well. Let the penguin be the penguin and keep their own menu, you guys should just do the blue plate thing, and do it better than anyone else; you're sort of half in-half out with both concepts. Also there were like 20 biker guys/gals out front when we came in (mind you it was around midnight) that were a little sketchy; they didn't really seem to be eating/drinking, more just loitering. I don't have anything against the bike crowd, but it caused the entrance to be a little awkward and uninviting. I might give it another shot, but this time wasn't that great, sorry guys.I've gone to the Diamond an many occasions, and it has always been spotty.  One visit terrible, one visit pretty good, but never great.  After my visit this past weekend, I guess I'm calling it quits.  The bottom line is that it's not worth going to a place when the odds are the service and food will sorely disappoint.  We had two people visiting from out of town, and forgot Dish was closed, so we figured "hey, the Diamond wasn't too bad last time, let's go there."  Luckily, there was no wait, the four of us sat down, asked what the specials were and it turned out they were out of the specials.  Two of us then ordered the black bean burger.  They were out of that too.  We got some other stuff, and a starter of fried pickles, which were okay.  My friend asked the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh, because she was thinking about a BLT.  The waiter seemed offended and gave a dismissive,  "yes."  Then we waited and waited for the food.  It took way too long to come out.We finally got our dishes.  I was okay with mine, but everyone else was very disappointed.  It was as if Diamond shops for the absolute bottom-rung ingredients.    If you put a salad on a menu, it should be at least somewhat appetizing.  The small block burger was a sad, ugly  thing.  The tomatoes were hard and without much flavor.  One person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as "disgusting."  I was embarrassed to have brought friends there.The take-away lesson here is that it's great to be a local institution.  It's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele.  But if you're a restaurant, it's still all about the food for most of your patrons.  You need to have quality food.  And don't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner.  Especially when you're charging $9 or more for some plates.  A lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price.So the Diamond is still a great place to get a drink, but they've got to overhaul nearly everything when it comes to their food.
Sushi Q=Sushi Q was suggested to me by a regular customer. She and I share similar tastes in food and would often see each other at our neighborhood sushi favorite, Hana. Always up for a new food experience, I went to Sushi Q with my partner tonight and was pleasantly surprised.It's one of those unassuming, stuck-in-a-strip-mall-in-an-odd-part-of-town places -- tucked away between a liquor store and baskin-robbins on 19th avenue, just south of dunlap. Inside is a somewhat typical looking sushi place, a little dated but with a nice enough wooden sushi bar and some cute japanese accents (geisha prints, sake bottles, row of cute fortune cat figures.)My partner had already arrived and was enjoying a couple items off the all-you-can-eat menu, so I decided to join him. I'm not much of an all-you-can eat person, but somehow it seems OK here - and a decent bargain at $25 per person. I'm happy to say that it was a smart decision as everything we had was really good to delicious. Not to mention a great way to sample items on the sushi menu. (AYCE menu is a bit more limited than regular sushi menu, but still offers a good variety of items)You'll find most of the usual suspects on the AYCE sushi menu, plus a variety of specialty rolls. Salmon and albacore nigiri, spicy tuna handroll and agadashi tofu were all very good (though agadashi was really just tempura tofu with dipping sauce). Red Snapper nigiri was outstanding -  fresh light fish with a citrus ponzu, green onion and bit of sriracha for just the right kick. Also really enjoyed the Hot Night roll - spicy tuna, crab and avocado deep fried and topped with spicy mayo, sriracha and sesame seeds - yum! what's not to like about that?There's also a small but decent selection of sake and beer here, and prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi spots in town. Our server and sushi chef were very nice and helpful, and I have a feeling that the more we come back, the more we'll feel like family. And I can tell you now, we'll be back many times...One night during my visit to Arizona, I was extremely hungry and craving sushi. Dining at traditional sushi restaurants was not an option ($$$$). I searched all over town for AYCE sushi and Sushi Q was the only restaurant that Yelp returned within Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, Phoenix, and Scottsdale. I jumped into my car and quickly roared out to Sushi Q at around 7:00pm. Sushi Q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. When I arrived during happy hour, there were only 3 people in the restaurant! There's no need to beat the dinner rush here. I sat at the bar and designated myself as an AYCE customer. After perusing the order menu, I was upset to discover an 8 order limit on the nigiri. 8 orders = 16 pieces. When I eat AYCE sushi in California, I typically average ~50 pieces, with a personal record of 64. Nobody cares how much you order in California, as long as you don't throw up on premises. Apparently not the case in stingy Arizona.The nigiri menu is sparse with limitations to the basic fish. Uni was not an option on the menu. Neither were any premium fish (not even off the AYCE menu). I ordered the standard choices: albacore, mackerel, red snapper, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallop, and yellowtail. The rice was served at room temperature as it should be. The fish quality of the tuna, salmon, and red snapper was acceptable, but the presentation for the other sushi was poor. Excessive ponzu sauce and green onions were applied on top of the yellowtail, mackerel, and albacore, to the point where I could not taste the distinct flavor of each fish. See photos for the sloppy preparation and the overuse of onions. The quality was disappointing even for a Korean sushi chef.For economic purposes, Sushi Q expects AYCE customers to fill up on appetizers and rolls rather than the fish. I feared leaving with a half full stomach, so I ordered rolls and appetizers after the nigiri. Rolls do not have order limits, but premium rolls were strategically removed from the AYCE menu. I asked for the negi salmon roll, yellowtail roll, and rainboll roll. The rolls were handled by a Hispanic sushi chef. The rainbow roll was standard, although the rice was a bit stiff. Yellowtail roll was a salty disaster, with excessive garlic/chili sauce drenched over the fish that spread to the rice. Fortunately, the negi salmon roll was acceptable with minimal sauces used and generous amount of salmon in each piece. Be aware that appetizers are full orders. I ordered agedashi tofu expecting just a few pieces of hot tofu. Instead, I received a basket full of fried tofu enough to feed a family of 3. The agedashi tofu was a joke. It was supposed to be served in a broth with Katsuobushi, Japanese onions, some rice wine, and soy sauce, but all that was given was a bowl of soy sauce separated from the tofu.In the end, I left with a full stomach but was dissatisfied with the quality of food consumed. I came to eat sushi but was instead instructed to order mediocre rolls engulfed in puddles of assorted sauces. The 16 piece limit is a severe limitation that renders the AYCE option as not cost-effective ($23.95 for dinner).
The Lodge At Fort Apache=Neighborhood taverns and lodges make it an easy stop for a simple lunch break.It was quiet on a Wednesday as we were the only ones here for lunch.  The waitress came out and got our beverages going as we checked out the menu.I went for the Grilled Chicken & Avocado Sandwich "Marinated grilled chicken breast, fresh avocado, swiss cheese, apple wood bacon, red onion, tomato and sprouts.  Served with mayo, on a fresh baked roll." ($8.95)  My sandwich was surprisingly really good - the chicken was very flavorful and not dry at all.  It was definitely a score with my choice! The Husband went for their Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich "Tender tri-tip, lighted grilled then dipped in our slow cooked rosemary au jus, topped with swiss cheese and stuffed in a toasted hoagie roll." ($8.95)  Sadly, it was very disappointing for him, lacking flavor and the au jus definitely needed a little something to jazz it up.All sandwiches and wraps come with your choice of fries, onion rings, cole slaw or side salad.  We both chose the side salad and definitely appreciate that it's a generous side salad, not those things you get from Wendy's! Overall, I was really pleased and the Husband was not.  I guess it's a hit or miss here.  They still accept the Entertainment coupon here!
Picasso's=Picasso's Pizza is my favorite pizza joint in the Madison area by virtue of their consistency and continuous quality.  There are plenty of places to get a great pizza in Madison and the surrounding area, but I find myself coming back to Picasso's time and time again.  A good part of this is the location.  Picasso's is located in an small strip mall off of Verona Road in Fitchburg.  Not exactly a chic location, but it happens to fall about halfway between my place and my best friends' in Fitchburg.  Another friend lives within walking distance.  It's the kind of place where we can all meet up, have a couple of pitchers of their excellent taps and enjoy a few of their signature pizzas.  There is even a nice seating area in the lawn out back during the summer months.  The atmosphere is always laid back and friendly.  The staff seem to always be happy to see you and are quick and efficient.The pizzas: I personally have tried about half of the specialty pizzas and I have not come across one that I did not like.  What really sets the pizzas apart is the crispy thin crust, fresh toppings and the interesting combinations.  The crust can be too thin for some people, especially on the center pieces (square cut) which can be nearly impossible to eat by hand.  This doesn't bother me since I like mine in this style.  My personal favorites are the Venetian (spinach, artichoke, olives), Gorgonzola Ribeye (steak, onions, mushrooms & gorgonzola), Treehugger (veggie pizza with marinara) and Cajun Comfort (chicken and andouille sausage with spicy cream sauce).  I have also gotten the Chicago stuffed pizza here, which was a treat.  Not quite Giordano's, but certainly the best I've had in Madison.  It took upwards of an hour, but my parents and I enjoyed a nice bottle of wine while we waited.  Picasso's does dine in, carry out or delivery.  There have been a few times we've done delivery and not received anything for over an hour.  To be fair these have been on busy weekend nights and the pizza still came hot, but because of this we do delivery only on weeknights.There is a whole lot of other items on the menu, much more than I have ever tried.  It seems that every time I come here I eye the pasta entrees but come back to the pizza.  One time I'll get adventuresome but I've only ventured off the pizza menu a couple of times for sandwiches.  My favorite is the Hot Hoagie, which is a toasted italian with a lot of cheese.  It's a bit sloppy (like their pizzas) but completely worth it.  The appetizers are always delicious.  I make it a point to get the garlic cheese bread just about every time, and the fried portabella mushrooms are great.  My father and I have also gotten the Cajun mussels - perfectly done, balancing the savory garlic butter with a bit of spice.  Lastly, the beer selection at Picasso's is bar none.  Even if you just go with the taps there is always an excellent selection of micros both local and national, combined with a great import selection.  There is a nice wine list too, but I rarely get past the taps to even consider it.  Picasso's is an excellent pizza place that is a lot more than pizza.
Eye Opener Family Restaurant=After the VYE at Desert Mission Food Bank, many of the Yelpers stuck around to grab brunch someplace in Sunnyslope. While there were a lot of options to chose from, I'm proud my fellow Yelpers decided to try a place that had yet to be reviewed: The Eye Opener Family Restaurant (formerly Tom & Tiny's). This Phoenix family-owned diner is open 7 days a week from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. for breakfast and lunch and is a morning ritual for many of Sunnyslope's longtime residents. One of my favorite things about Sunnyslope is the small town feel with access to all the urban amenities of Phoenix. Places like the Eye Opener feed that sense of place. Hal (the owner) is a kind man who loves what he does, is liable to come by your table himself to fill your coffee cup and make sure everything is OK . It is evident that he views his customers as extended family. Here are some of the things I like to eat at the Eye Opener: Standard eggs, toast and hash brown breakfast  the Chef omelet - egg whites only (filled with yummy things like ham and green chili and topped with cheese) Gyro (the tzasiki sauce is delicious and is flavored with dill!) It's not on the menu, but Hal makes his own hummus and it's just delicious!!Since moving to Sunnyslope, I've been on the lookout for good neighborhood restaurants. I'm very happy to have stumbled upon this place. The Eye Opener feels like a small-town diner and is surprisingly large inside. Everyone was incredibly friendly and the food was outstanding. I ordered the chicken fried steak, eggs and hash browns. The hash browns were sliced, sort of like thick potato chips and fried. The gravy on the chicken fried steak contained large chunks of sausage and was full of flavor, and my eggs were perfect. My meal came with two biscuits, as well. I don't think I was hungry for the rest of the day. So good, will definitely be back.Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so I feel quite qualified to give a solid four star review to The Eye Opener. Before I get to far, this is a diner. If you are a snob, spare yourself and the pleasant folk who work here and go somewhere else. The very pregnant waitress handled our very large VYE group quickly and efficiently. I don't think I could have walked across the room with a belly that big, but she glided around taking orders and delivering drinks like she was training for a marathon. Okay, I exaggerate a little. For diner coffee, I don't think it was bad at all (sorry christina!). In fact, it was way better than coffee at Denny's or IHOP. My meal was pretty tasty. I ordered an egg white omelet with green chili, hash browns and an english muffin. I was really glad to see the large portion size because after packing bags all morning, I was HUNGRY. I am pretty sure that the salsa they had sitting at the table was really pizza sauce, but fortunately they had Tabasco so I was good to go. I think my meal was like ten bucks. I tipped our lovely waitress five. My breakfast and the experience was more than worth the fifteen :)Kevin's Eye Opener ROTD was a reminder that I hadn't yelped about my experience yet!  I was part of the group that went for brunch at Eye Opener after the food bank VYE... and just like everyone else, I was impressed with this new Sunnyslope find!  It's totally a diner and you can tell there are a ton of 'regulars' there.  Our big group had fantastic service, and although I found my food to be pretty standard, I guess that's what you get when you go to most diners!  I was impressed that they did egg whites for me no problem in my mushroom and swiss omelette.  The 'swiss' was just barely melted on top, and you could tell it was a 'Kraft' single, or more likely, a generic brand single... you know what I mean - those perfect square shaped pieces.  The mushrooms were straight from a can, but I was starving, and I ate every last bite of the omelette as well as the toast and sliced tomato it came with.  Eye Opener really is a hidden gem in Sunnyslope - go check it out next time you're in the area, but probably not worth a special trip.Right off the bat they got 2 things going for them.  They open at 6 so you don't waste half the morning getting breakfast and they serve grits, with butter.I had the chefs omelet, grits and an English muffin. I happen to like my stuff cooked into the eggs and I still call it an omelet.  The food was good.  The service was good too.  If you are a first time visitor you get introduced to all the servers.  Most of the folks there seemed to be regulars.  While nothing was over the top great it is a good solid place to get breakfast or lunch.
May Garden Restaurant=I wish I had talked Zoe into Siu Wok...Ugh.  Ok, this place is cheap.  That's always a plus.  We wanted take-out from the buffet.  You get a card (kinda like at Chino Bandito) and mark what you want from the buffet.  Hostess takes card to the buffet and fills your take-out box.  Ok, here is where she actually GETS stars.  My box was full.  Overloaded.  Always a plus, as Chinese take-out is always good the next day.  Lo Mein, sesame chicken, egg roll (she gave me 2!), beef with broccoli, some shrimp thing and BBQ pork ribs.  8.18 with tax for what has turned out (so far) to be 4 meals.  There is a complete lack of flavor for most of the dishes.  The only one that actually HAD flavor was the ribs.  The rest?  MEH.  I never use "meh," but in this case, it works.There was only one packet of soy sauce in the bag.  No sweet and sour for my egg rolls.  The lo mein?  No flavor.  Shrimp thing?  Actually had shrimp in it, but, still, no flavor.I'm a bit pissed, because I had a real craving for Chinese food.  What I really got was Grandma making Chinese that Gramps could eat without feeling it the next day.Me, I'm not feeling this place at ALL.  The only thing that got them stars was the size of the take-out portion and the price.  MEH.
300 East=I've been to 300 East now for both dinner and lunch and I can't choose a favorite. The location is splendid and conveniently located off of East Blvd, the old house is outfitted nicely to fit the targeted ambiance, and the food matches everything above. Our last visit consisted of a few apps and entrees: Baked French Onion - Small crock, croutons, textbook flavor, gratuitous provalone baked on top. Can't find a thing I don't love about it. Sweet Potato Ravioli - Nice mix of savory, sweet, and creamy flavors. A little too heavy on the cream sauce, but the rav was al dente and sang on the forefront with holiday-esque spice. Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - The dressings alone make this salad crave-worthy. Sesame, soy, ginger, hoisin, of which are perfectly balanced. The tuna was gorgeous and was even better with each bite. Much like aforementioned by the infamous Jeff S, the Matilda Wong is not only a right of passage for first-time 300 East-goers, but for booze lovers everywhere. It's 32oz pitcher, quite literally, filled with three different kinds of booze. It tastes like liquid candy and goodness gracious I love it. Parking is straight up atrocious. Forget about feeling comfortable leaving your car behind this old house. A half dozen signs screaming "Your car will be tortured by a towing service if left here." Not the most comforting parking arrangement. Find a space on the street if you can.Regardless, this place rules. Pricepoint is fair, food is great, booze is even better.
Zarra's A Taste of Southern Italy=I came here with my parents this past Fri. evening at around 6pm.  I live a few blocks away and Zarra's was one of the closest places I had bookmarked.  Given that my mom is a picky eater and enjoys casual Italian eateries, and that my parents were staying in Oakland (not at the hotel across the street, FWIW), I figured it was as good of a reason as any to check it out. Zarra's is most definitely an old school red sauce joint, so it fits the bill for Pittsburgh Italian comfort food--don't come here if you're expecting trendy, cutting-edge fare.For our entrees, my mom had the meatless lasagna ($16), my dad has the Zarra's sampler ($22), and I had the ricotta noodles ($18).  All of the entrees came with side salads, as well as a shared bread plate.  The bread was insubstantial and mediocre, and came with an oil dipping sauce, which is a good thing, since it wouldn't have held up to butter.  The salads were along the same lines, consisting of spinach dressed with a vinaigrette sauce and a few vegetables that most likely came out of a can.  You can get blue cheese on your salad, which my mom and I did, or anchovies, as my dad did, but just be aware that these additions come at an upcharge.Fortunately, the entrees were better.  The manicotti had an interesting pointy shape and light texture that was different than any I've eaten before.  Flavorwise, they weren't too exciting, which was also true for the red sauce.  Each entree came with a side of sausage, meatball, or eggplant, so I chose the latter for mine since I'm inherently leery of ground meat.  The eggplant added some variety to the dish, but I found it a bit on the mushy side.  My mom and dad enjoyed their entrees--my mom is picky about the composition of lasagna, so I was happy to see that she ate it without picking it apart.  I tried a bite of it, and it was pretty similar to the lasagna she makes at home, which is probably why.  I didn't try any of the other items, so I can't directly comment on them except to say that the meatballs are huge (about 3" in diameter and twice the size of meatballs I've had at the meatball joint downtown).  I wanted to try the baked Alaska since I'd never had one, but my parents were too full to share it with me, and I didn't want to get stuck eating the whole thing, so we ended up passing on it.Overall, we were generally satisfied with our meal at Zarra's, despite the lackluster start to the meal.  The fare was exactly what I expected, satisfying my mom's pickiness and filling us all up after a long day of travel or work.  The service was excellent, as was proper given that we were about the only ones in the restaurant other than a few people sitting on the porch by the time we left.  As others have mentioned, the decor--right down to the toilet seat in the women's restroom--is interesting and eclectic, and makes for good conversation.  While I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back sometime--perhaps to try the baked Alaska--given its convenience to my apt.  3.5 stars.
Michael's Frozen Custard=Let me begin by saying I am a native of Madison and have been a lifelong lover of Michael's since it opened in 1986.  Let me also state that my rating is partly a protest vote against the asinine dance music that is incessantly  blared at the Monroe St. location.  The music has become so annoying I am struggling to bring myself to enjoy stopping by any longer.  I've asked the employees why it's played and I'm told "it's the owner's iPod" and that the employees basically can't do anything about it.  That said, let's get to business:Michael's is Madison's local independent custard joint.  It's been around since the 1980s and has a solid history in the Monroe Street neighborhood where this location is located.  As far as frozen custard goes, Michael's is pretty good but it's just not what it once was.  Even I have to admit that rapidly expanding, yet Wisconsin based Culver's offers better custard today.  I've returned to Madison from Los Angeles for a couple weeks every summer for about 10 years and Michael's has gradually lost a lot of its appeal.The Custard:  It's not as creamy as it once was but the real problem is that the flavors are losing creativity and failing to come together as they once did.  Case in point: my wife's Mint Chip had no chips tonight while another patron's was overflowing with chocolate chips.  The quality control is not there.  The texture is lacking the creaminess so important in good custard.  And the flavors rarely have fresh berries - a sign that the custard is just not made fresh like it once was.  The employees were once local teenagers, usually West High Students or Edgewood High students that looked like they were having fun and engaging the customers.  Today, employees are disengaged and give you the impression they're just going through the motions.  They do the job...but that's it.  The store itself is reasonably clean but it's the details that count.  The fluorescent lights are covered in bugs and spider webs, the parking lot is deteriorating, and the store basically needs some investment (bathrooms, lighting, landscaping etc...)This takes me to my final point: the Music.  It drives my totally crazy.  Why is a Frozen Custard stand in Madison Wisconsin that is covered in kitschy 1950'sesque décor blaring club music every time I go there (this has been a constant for several years now)?  If the custard was perfect and the customer service impeccable, fine, I'll live with it.  But Michael's is a restaurant that has disengaged ownership and functions as a conveyor belt of cash to the owner's pocket.  It's the worst kind of independent retail: retail that doesn't care about customers because they'll keep coming back.  In the end it's sad to admit as a proud Madisonian that my Milwaukee friends are correct:  Kopp's is better.  Oh how I miss what you once were Michael's Frozen Custard.
The Bread Company=Something has got to be done about the abominable service at The Bread Company.. It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, "are there potatoes and salad?" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, "didn't we go over this already?!" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store=There are only two reasons i would return to Arizona. 1. To visit my cousin!! 2. Momma's French Toast Breakfast OMG...this place is to die for! I came here for breakfast and ordered the Mommas French Toast. Seriously the best french toast I have ever had...even...SHHH don't tell grandma...but yes better than my grandmas! They use sourdough toast to make the french toast and omg just so good. I'm just sad they don't have them in California. Service was Excellent.. I think her name was Yesenia ...but yeah she was awesome! Our coffee and Ice tea was full at all times!! I am already planning my trip in December and Cracker Barrel is definitely one of my stops on my way!
My Florist Cafe=When I first moved to Phoenix a few years back I lived by PV Mall. Most of the restaurant selections there are of the chain variety. Chili's. Island Burger. Outback. Blah, blah, blah. Yuck, yuck, yuck. Then my roomie took me to My Florist. Upon entering this delicious, open, artsy, space, I heard angels sing. Had the Phoenix culinary heavens finally allowed me to enter? Has the mundane hell of robotic chain service combined with predictable and flavorless fare finally fanned its way out my new life in Phoenix? Had it? Had it? Well, yes and no.  My first experience was a bit tarnished as I sat with my roomie and the owner and was getting the VIP treatment. We noshed on fabulous cheeses, jams and breads. Drank endless amounts of champagne. Excuse me, but is your hand on my knee? Hmm...didn't care. Was having fun. Sampled an array of average to pretty good desserts. Servers seemed afraid of said owner. I was tipsy, flirty and fresh meat in a new town. Oh did I mention I also could have used a manager or server job? That said, I had a fun night and couldn't wait to go back. Well, I've been back several times. Here's what I think. The sandwiches can be yummy but are quite small. Salad can be good, but not always cold and fresh. Stick with the cheese and bread type thing, get hammered on some champagne and all is well. It can be hard to get service here as I have left twice after not even being said hello to. When I was there they had an amazing pianist play in the evenings. I couldn't believe guests actually had the nerve, the nerve I say, to ask her to play softer! Ugh! Go home to your Siamese and a Lean Cuisine honey. All the best yelpers!My Florist Cafe is misunderstood - by nearly everyone. Living in Phoenix you get used to how things are. If you own a food spot, it's either a coffee shop, a bar, or restaurant. Much like the clear zoning lines between residential and commercial, Phoenix food spots are either this or that, and rarely allowed to be anything else - it would be too confusing.So while the complaints about My Florist cover a variety of subjects from the lousy menu, the lousy food, and the lousy service, it's only compounded by the fact that when you enter My Florist, you're expecting to enter an actual restaurant. Someplace you can get hot food, drinks and listen to jazz music while sitting there pretending you're in a completely different city. One that's more metropolitan, one that's more urban and cool, one that doesn't shut down at 10 o'clock.My Florist Cafe fails, consistently and miserably. Oddly, years of bad service, bad food, and surprisingly boring bread haven't stopped people from giving this place a chance. Over and over again.Sure they have one of the best jazz pianists in all of Phoenix (at least that you can find easily without having to be in any sort of music circles), but is that really enough? With the servers dressed up, disappearing regularly and delivering plates full of hard, nearly unedible bread, while having no knowledge at all about any of the wines they're suggesting, why do people continue to frequent this place?I think our expectations are too high. Take away the bad service, don't expect too much out of the food, disregard any of the servers suggestions regarding wine and what do you have? Probably one of the more unique atmospheres you can find in Phoenix. For the price and the location, there really isn't anything like the ambiance you'll get at My Florist Cafe.With an upscale decor, enough tables to comfortably fit a small group, the jazz piano in the background and the hum of coversation filling the room, I would dare say that there isn't anything like this anywhere else in Phoenix. Sure there are different places to go such as Chez Nous, but comparing the two would be wrong. Where Chez Nous is a great, dark, soulful R&B lounge, My Florists is excellently open and bright.However, in the end My Florist Cafe has spent years and years unchanged. You can only say a restaurant could be so much more for so long. After a while, you decide to give up on it. You decide that it really won't change. You decide that for some unknown reason, the servers are different every week and so are their managers - but at least the woman playing piano can generally be counted on.My advice? Try My Florist once a year. Don't order any food, and definitely don't order any bread. Bring some friends, order a bottle of wine of your own choosing, not the server's suggestions, and have a great time in one of Phoenix's few unique cafes.I'm pretty sure I've figured the conundrum of My Florist out, because it is nothing if not a challenge to logical reasoning everywhere.  See if you agree...People who rave about it - because you know they're out there, we've all heard them - live in places like Scottsdale, or Tempe, or Gilbert, or Mesa, or Peoria or CHANDLER. And they're woman of a certain age demographic. And they wear floral prints and drive a Lexus and have above average but spiritually empty occupations. They have a couple of kids who excel in school and play sports. For these wonderful women who I don't understand on any level, it's home. It's a place to go and eat the food they're supposed to be eating and drink the iced teas they're supposed to be drinking and talk about their lives and enjoy each other. One recommendation. I hate hate hate valet parking. I HATE it so much. Once they broke my convertible top and additionally couldn't figure out how to drive my Prius. I won't turn over my keys to them. I park across the street. I do what I have to do. Get rid of it. Die die die... So anyway, the food is blander than bland. The servers are friendly enough but it's always been slow in my experience. I just don't get it other than it fits exactly one demographic and they drag the rest of us there. I'm sorry if I've offended you with this analysis. But if the shoe fits.We went to My Florist with four other people we met through Yelp. The idea was to have brunch (it was 11 am on a Sunday), but when we arrived and were seated, we were extremely disappointed to find out that they were no longer serving brunch! It was pretty hard to recover from this blow, but we were hungry and already seated, so we had to force ourselves to abandon dreams of pancakes and eggs and pick something from their lunch menu. I chose the portobello sandwich ($10.25), and my husband got the roast beef sandwich ($12.50). We both also got Bloody Marys. Both the sandwiches and drinks were disappointing. The portobello sandwich was ok, although the mushroom was a little overcooked and rubbery and the foccacia was a bit greasy. My husband's roast beef sandwich was even worse, though. Not only was the roast beef far from "rare," as the menu promised it would be, but it looked like My Florist had picked up Subway's leftover cold cuts and repackaged them in a sandwich that cost 3 times the price. The cheddar also tasted super standard (think Kraft singles). For $12.50, the sandwich should have tasted a lot more premium that it did. We did enjoy the light and bright atmosphere inside the cafe and thought it was a good environment for conversation (not too loud, but not quiet and awkward), but were very disappointed with the food. If we actually wake up early enough on a Sunday to make it there before 11, we might give this place another chance for brunch, but since we don't live that close, we probably won't go out of our way to come back.I've had pretty good experiences here. Not "unforgettable" but I'll definitely be back. I will start by echoing the half off bottles of wine thing.....fabulous. You know I like to get my vino on... and if you don't know, now you know. I have been twice now and I'll tell you, the service at the bar is fantastic. My first experience I only tried the spinach artichoke dip, which was just okay... and had something called a tira-tini for desert (which was tiramisu  in a sort of metal martini glass). It was AMAZING and I am soooooo not a desert person. The bartender that waited on us was very sweet and knowledgeable and let us try a couple of different types of wine before deciding. The second time I went to My Florist I had The Portobello Sandwich which was also pretty good...once again, not great but better than anything I would make at home so worth the trip. My only suggestion regarding the food is to focus on individual flavor a little more. Everything that I've had here other than dessert has been a little bland. That said, I still enjoyed my experiences and the service and I will return.Okay... I feel bad b/c I see a lot of great reviews for this place but honestly, I had the worst experience ever here, so I'm giving this  a straight up 1 star.  Let me make a few things clear before I get started: 1. I arrived before the lunch rush...way before the lunch rush, I was like the 1st person in the restaurant2. I was meeting friends there for a brunch/networking thing, it was four of us all together3. The bad experience started after I tipped... as most bad experience doThe food was okay, I had an omelet which was decent.. but it's hard to beat Fez's egg white omelets in my heart. But the omelet was okay, the atmosphere and decor was amazing, the service was exactly what you expect as a customer.....Then right when I put in my mental to-do list to give this place 4 to 5 stars on yelp the waiter comes and tells us, after we tipped, that the table we had was for "someone special" (who by the way didn't have a reservation) and we had to leave.... wtf? How do you tell paying customers and good tippers that they need to leave before the ink even dries on the receipts?  We were pretty upset and asked to speak to the manager, who wasn't present, but the acting manager basically gave us the boot as well. First time ever I was asked to leave a restaurant....So has this restaurant ever seen better days?I came here Friday night with my guy looking to enjoy a semi-romantic meal before heading over to the subtle sexiness that is SideBar.  I looked over the Yelp reviews, decided to give this place a try because the main complaints were about service, which I can deal with.So we walked into a mostly empty restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday, not the most comforting sign of a business.  It takes our waitress a little while to stop by our table...so we peruse the drink menu...finally she stops by and we get the Ginger Girl and the Me So Thorny.I took one sip of the Ginger Girl and my throat was immediately burning.  I like strong drinks, but this was pure gasoline.  My guy's drink wasn't any better.  Definitely stick with beer or wine at this place.After 15 minutes our waitress decides to stop by and take our order.  Apparently one can only order one course at a time.  So we order the appetizers, which was the main attraction.  Postino's bruschetta in downtown.  But it's not even close to Postino's.  The bread isn't toasted, you only get two awkward pieces of each, the toppings aren't fresh, and they definitely don't give you enough toppings!The cheese plate was alright, two really small pieces of cheese in my opinion.  They do give you a lot of bread, because that's what you're really paying for.The entrees were okay.  My crab cakes were cold, which means they weren't even close to being prepared fresh.  My guy's shrimp looked pretty good, but just tasted okay.The only saving grace of this place is the lobster bisque.  Of course it was the soup of the day, so I doubt many people will get to enjoy it.Sad place, I can see why the reviews are just average or worse.Yummy food, open till midnight, walking distance from Sidebar, fantastic pianist... HOW HAVE I NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE?!? We walked in at 1045 on a Saturday night, ever-so-slightly depressed, sober (hence the depression); the three of us.  We were seated right away, and the kind host offered us a lunch menu in addition to the three dinner menus, which I thought a bit odd, the only snafu, if you can call it that, of the evening.  I ate the cup of squash soup ($5, including a brulee'd ginger marshmallow that will blow your mind) and split the bruschetta plate ($12) and tasted the creme brulee ($7?) and thought everything was delicious.  The bruschetta, in particular, was standout and made for a great snack.  The kitchen, according to our accommodating server, closed at 1130, so I'll bear that in mind when i next get the late-night munchies.  The pianist shut down at about five, maybe ten till midnight.  We didn't leave till about 10 after midnight, quite satisfied and with spirits much lifted.  I suppose that last part may have had a little something to do with the fact the two TVs over the bar were playing Spaceballs, but also the food was delectable, so who knows.  i'll be back, and i might just bring a fifth star with me.-Fancy salad place.-Salads are very yummy.-Parking is a pain in the butt.-Pricey for lunch.
Joyful House Chinese Cuisine=Excellent place and open late to boot!  If I am here with 4 or more, we usually just go with one of the dinner sets on the 1st page of the menu.  Great value and you get A TON of food.  Something is seriously wrong if you ain't totally full after that.I am a sucker for fresh squid so that is one dish I always order if it isn't a group outing.  I've been happy with everything I've ordered there.This place is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. Hands down. Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.We ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.Wow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there. The Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.The Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.The Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.The Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.Last but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.This place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret. I've been back here at least 5 times since I first discovered it. Its that good.As always, pictures are included! Yummy!"The MSG is strong in this one" , that's what I expected my fortune cookie to read after tanking 5 glasses of water and 5 cups of hot tea.But none the less the food was fantastic.Here's what we ordered for a party of 3.Scallop SoupHoney Walnut Shrimp (HUGE PRAWNS)2 lb Garlic CrabPan Fried Sea Bass with Soy Sauce Sizzling Beef platterBlack Bean ClamsRoast DuckChicken Chow Fun.God. Please forgive me for I have sinned. I am a gluttonous whore and I deserve to have an apple stuffed in my mouth and be roasted over an open flame.A Chinese hot pot place?!  Richard C. proclaimed that Joyful House offered such a treat after 10 pm!Last Friday night, the Husband and I ventured over to Spring Mountain to find out if such a thing really did exist.  We were only expecting Chinese hot pot, not AYCE for the mere price of $15.50/pp.We were easily persuaded and a quick peek at what they offered helped as well.As they set up the gas stove and dual hot pot, they also provided two dipping sauces - one being a chili oil and the other a sesame-like paste.Everything was laid out nicely on a couple of tables along the back: * octopus balls* beef balls* pork balls* wontons* dumplings* chicken* beef* pork* squid* mussels* shrimp* napa cabbage* spinach* bok choy* tofu* tofu sheets* flat rice noodles* vermicelli noodlesI'm sure they had a few other things that I forgot to mention.  Also in the broth was taro and radish.For dessert, they offered complimentary red bean soup and fortune cookies.Service was surprisingly attentive.  It was slow when we arrived shortly after 10 pm, and there were a few diners.  Business picked up with at least two large parties also enjoying the AYCE hot pot.  The staff was good at refilling our water, tea, and asking if we needed more broth in our pot.  They had a lot of staff around, so that was a good thing.Late night AYCE Chinese hot pot begins at 9 pm! 3.5 starsI chop yo chicken!!! I chop yo chicken into small chunks. I don't mince yo chicken.... I just chop into tiny juicy pieces. This is the reason why the egg drop soup with minced chicken didn't suck. Unlike Most restaurants which tend to abuse their chicken (Capitol Seafood), Joyful did chicken right like your gams gams making homemade chicken soup. But not everybody is your gam gams, and most tend to abuse their chicken because chicken is so lean it leads to dry bland chicken bits that you will choke on (I just wanted to put "choke" and "chicken" in the same sentence).The spicy and probably sour shrimp was decent, but not stellar although they did do a stand-up job on prepping those on-yerns (onions) which was sliced thinly - most Chinese restaurants will just quarter the onions.... slackers!Also ordered the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot vegetable dish. Nothing like your leafy green vegetables to keep you "regular"... this might be good for you, if you're one of those people that disappear for an hour or so with a magazine under your arm. FYI - I'm in'n'out in record time... the secret is "leafy greens".The last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinctive flavor. That's why I'll generically just say it was "decent".The reason why I tried this place out, is because I can't stand getting screwed with all the high priced, hyped up crap on the strip. Instead, I like my "crap" off the strip.... speaking of crap, those leafy greens I had earlier is working their magic.This was an easy late night staple and we've eaten here quite a bit of times. What we have gotten is pretty good and have not had a bad experience here yet. It's not the best I've had, but it is solid and specially when it comes to late night where most places go downhill in quality, I appreciate that it's consistent. We just get off of work, we're not drunk so we actually care what food tastes like.They have stuff that serves more for a friendly palette but they also have legit dishes too and have tried quite a few of those are are indeed, authentic and want to note in particular that the seafood is fresh and fairly priced. Servers are pretty friendly here too, specially since the late night crew are the same, they are familiar with us and are attentive on the drinks refillsIt's a good standby for late night eats. We are fairly regular here.Yelp Challenge 365 # 177/365Seafood at its best!!!! I would never have found this place if not for Rod U who kindly directed me to several places in the great city of Las Vegas.Unfortunately, there were no spot prawns when we dined but chose crab and shrimp in a basket with garlic and vegetables... we were there for lunch so it was just the right amount= not to heavy and enough to satisfy our appetite. Noodle dish? Cake noodle topped with more seafood and a side dish of green beans (lots of chili pepper with it too !)The food was excellent by taste and the service as excellent. Oh, parking was plentiful compared to other restaurants and shops in the Vegas Chinatown district. A definite stop if you're into seafood, chinese style!OUTSTANDING seafood."That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response."Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues."Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced."What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice."And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin"."I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.We ventured out to Joyful House with another couple and had another very good meal but not a five-star dining experience.  The broth of Seafood Wor Wonton Soup was quite flavorful, and the filled wontons very memorable, but a scary-looking Calamari, tough scallops, and inferior pork made the soup a story of contrasts.  Average-sized pan-fried Potstickers were good and I received my several requested condiments of sliced ginger, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Potsticker Sauce with onions, Hoisin Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil without any difficulty, and Shrimp-Fried Rice with carrots and peas was very good.  Beef & Snow Peas with Black Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce was a sumptuous Cantonese dish, and Kung Pao Chicken had a nice level of controlled heat.  Service by the well-trained and disciplined staff was consistently on the ball and responsive to needs.Four solid stars this time out!It was almost midnight and all I could think about was how much I wanted some chow mein. Not the kind of chow mein from a cheap, take-out place but the real stuff. I searched Chinese food in my Yelp app and Joyful House came up first on the results. The reviews had me sold, so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack. The parking lot was a little dark, but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed. The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!) I definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet. Joyful House does Chinese food right and I will definitely be back for more.Vegas + drinking + 1am = greasy chinese food cravings kick in, STRUGGLE IS REAL!! My friends & I just finished our epic spartan race and idk why but my cravings for Panda Express Orange Chicken were going on overboost. However, my friends all said that the Panda Express on the strip (the only one open that late) wasn't as good as back in OC. I ain't about to waste my calories on crappy chinese food so luckily one of my friends that live in Vegas recommended Joyful House.I was surprised walking in that there were still families eating so late, so place must be good. The workers here speak english, but if you want any modifications you better know your chinese. Thank god they spoke cantonese so I busted my chinese speakin skills on them lolWonton soup - Started off w/ this, I liked that it was just the soup w/ veggies, wontons, and bbq pork. NO NOODLES YAY! It was a very big portion, but flavor was on point and no salty MSG. In fact, their soup was actually on the lighter side and not greasy. The BBQ Pork was lean and surprisingly one of the best I've had.Honey Walnut Shrimp - Busted my chinese to ask for mayo on the side and thank god I did! I recommend you try asking for the sauce on the side also, it makes a big difference. The shrimp was all nice and crispy, not leaking out oil at all from the batter. I think that if the sauce was on it, it'd make the shrimp soggy. Very good dish and they didn't skimp on the shrimp either! We still had half the plate left to take home. The shrimp were a good medium size, not overly coated in batterCrispy Orange Chicken - I wished it were a bit more crispy, didn't really satisfy my Panda Express cravings, but can't complain. The sauce wasn't the same as Panda either, but more like a traditional Orange Chicken flavor you'd get at asian restaurants like Sam Woo. It tastes great w/ the steamed white rice. I would say skip this and try another entree, it's not a TDF itemYang Chow Fried Rice - Fried rice w/ BBQ pork & Shrimp! You can get it chinese style which is Plain, Soy Sauce Free - Pan fried with Eggs and Shredded Cabbage, or American Style which has soy sauce. The fried rice was pretty good and again the BBQ pork was delicious! Really big portion, we had to take the rest home. Unlike most chinese restaurants, they didn't skimp on the bbq pork and shrimp! It wasn't too greasy either so brownie points for thatThey give you sweet and refreshing orange slices at the end of your meal which helped the hefty meal go down! Our total bill came out to be about $50 w/ tax which isn't bad. It's a great place for value, you get a lot for what you pay! Hits the midnight munchies in Vegas and the food tasted pretty authentic :)
Squirrel Hill Cafe=What can I say about The Cage that others haven't already said, based on my lone visit last night at 6?  I don't know, but for the sake of brevity, I'll sum up my visit with a pro-con list.Pros:1. Cheap, decent food.  My BLT ($4.25) was delightful, with crispy, juicy bacon and crisp, fresh lettuce--only the hothouse tomatoes disappointed.  Get the fries--they're hand-cut and delicious!  I tried some from a companion, and regretted not upgrading to a platter to get them.2. I can't comment on the drinks myself, since I'm not drinking at present, but everyone says they're good--and they're cheap, too.  I got a club soda ($1.25).3. Interesting people watching opportunities.  I wasn't able to take advantage of them due to concentrating on group discussion with my table mates, but the bits and pieces that I saw and overheard were amusing.Cons:1. Smoky.  If you're sensitive to cigarette smoke, don't come here!  When I first entered, I thought I might be okay with it, but then the table next to ours started smoking.  I could smell smoke on myself for the rest of the night until I changed and showered.2. Slow service.  Our waitress wasn't the swiftest or the most friendly, and it took 20 min. to get my BLT.  Getting change took way too long, too.3. $10 credit card minimum. I suspected this would be the case, so I hit the ATM next door before coming.  Plan accordingly.Quite honestly, though I enjoyed the food and company, I doubt I'll be back here soon due to the smoke.  Increasing my risk for lung cancer and reeking of eau de cigarette isn't my idea of a fun, relaxing night out.  If you don't mind that and the slow service, though, then by all means, stop by for some inexpensive, delicious food and drinks and take advantage of the interesting people watching opportunities.
Stackers Restaurant=First (and only) Half of Review: I happened into this dive bar/grill recently since it's near my NoPho / Ghettro-Center 'hood. Stackers gets points for having a few different beers on tap (Bass, I can't remember the rest) along with the regular boring finds. That's all I was there for at the time. I did not eat, but they seemed to offer a lot in the way of typical bar food. Maybe they have super delicious food, maybe not. I'll never know. There would have been a second half to this review. There would have been a follow-up where I found the place interesting enough to go back when I could sample the food, too, because I did find the place interesting enough to warrant that second visit. That's what I was planning to do as I sipped my beer. But there isn't going to be a second half to this review. It all came down to watching a skinny dude in a cap come in from out front -- obviously smoking cigarettes -- and proceed to gather ingredients and utensils and then actually make what looked like a big jug of tartar sauce, or something, and then prepping other items, WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.!! This is inexcusable. Skinny cap dude was not the cook at the time, a young lady was at the grill, but he was doing prep work in the back.  The trouble seemed like only him, so I resist my temptation to hard-nose and give only 1 star, and give them 2 instead.I had so completely planned to go back and try out what seemed like it was going to be some good bar & grill grub, but I just couldn't bring myself to do so. Maybe if I were to run out of other places to check out I'll try it again, but not if skinny cap dude is anywhere in my sight. For me Stacker's has fallen before even getting a chance, like a barely played out game of Jenga ruined by a clumsy player.
Gino's Restaurant=Oh Gino! Why did you leave me!I was only able to experience your lovely pizza once, but oh how I miss you.I deeply miss the excessive heap of crust, the copious amount of cheese, and the tremendous layer of tomato sauce, which you so wonderfully crafted. Deep dish pizza is now a pastime in Madison, something on which I nostalgically reflect. The Chicagoan in me deliciously craves this concoction that is currently nonexistent in this here county, much to my chagrin. Please come back.
Island Style=I was in the neighborhood for lunch and I was so pleased the other day when I first experienced this place, so I came back for more!The owner remembered me and had that same pleasing and chill attitude! Brought over the boiled peanuts quickly and took my order promptly as well:Fish Jun: Alaska Pollock Fish Fillet dipped/wrapped in egg! I loved the Meat Jun so I wanted to try the fish version this time. Well, it was the same difference!! So Mother Freakin' Good!! Soo "ONO" as the islanders would say! Once its dipped in their sauce, its a done deal. I had to ask what was the origin of the "----- Jun".... The Owner told me that it was Koreans in Hawaii that started making this back in the day.. Gamsahabnida! (Thank you!) Koreans from Hawaii! I was also brought the napa cabbage, radish and sprouts (korean sides). On top of that, a small bowl of hot Saimin soup to cleanse the palate. Nice! Again, A Completely Positive Experience!!You know the saying.....you can judge your main dish by how great the side dishes taste.  It's an older generation korean saying about how to judge a restaurant and their food quality.  Of all the Korean restaurants that I've been to, this place has to be the best in town! About 10 minutes from the strip, I highly recommend coming here for all your korean OR hawaiian food cravings.   Of course being a Yelpy, I found this on my phone app and noticed their great ratings by a lot of people.  Since bf loves hawaiian food and I absolutely need my kimchi fix at least once a day, this sounded like a perfect place to satisfy both our cravings.  Don't expect anything fancy.  It's located in a ghetto strip mall with nothing so glitzy like the strip.   But don't let that fool you!  I was skeptical about how their food would taste like when both the server and the owner were NOT korean.  However, once the big slab of kimchi came out along with the other side dishes, it was game over.   Even my mom was very impressed with the way they make their kimchi.  Then again, even my bf who doesn't EVER eat kimchi actually ate it!  Now that's saying a lot about how great and awesome they prepare their kimchi. My favorite was their radish kimchi.   We asked for more to take it back to the hotel with us!  Oh yeah, haven't even said anything about the main dishes yet.  lol  My mom and I shared the hot stone pot rice with veggies.  (dolsot bibimbap)  which was surprisingly good.  I especially loved the little pieces of marinated beef on top of the rice.  BF got the meat jun which he thought was very yummy.  He gives it 5 stars!  We also shared the fried dumplings and I loved the crispy won ton skin!  The overall experience was very positive and satisfying.    This is our Must Go to place in Vegas!The owner said his wife makes EVERYTHING herself and they also have another restaurant inside the Greenland market nearby.   Wish I can have her kimchi recipe.  I miss it.   I hope this restaurant stays for many more years to come so I can come visit whenever we're in Vegas!Second time I've been here. Better than the first...It's definitely the laid-back Hawaiian casual dining you'd find in the Islands, serving awesome Hawaiian & Korean food. Prices seem a little bit higher than their competitors, but you easily forget that when your food arrives. The portions are big, plentiful side dishes, and a vast menu, consisting of Loco Moco, fried rice, spam & eggs, to traditional Korean dishes like Bi Bim Bap, spicy tofu soup, and Kalbi. Last time I was there, I intended to get take-out. The staff greeted me warmly and saw that I had a grocery bag with me as I looked at the menu. They politely suggested I eat there, and offered to keep my milk chilled in their side fridge. Is that awesome or what?!?! I did end up eating there, ordered the Bi Bim Naeng Myun/Kalbi Combo, and took most of it home. How great was that for them to offer?!Service I received both visits were great, very friendly, and the staff always thanked and welcomed the customers back soon when they got up to leave. This is a no-frills casual hole-in-the-wall. What you get is a place that welcoming, friendly, and just plain great food, period. Definitely worth a try, then you'll be back for more...They are called Island Style but once you see their menu, you will discover that they serve Hawaiin, Korean, and American dishes.First off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it. So I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.I ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). I probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat. So overall, I wasnt really blown away. My bill was about 10 dollars. I tipped 2 bucks which was what I thought was more than generous considering my mediocre experience. I dont think I will be going out of my way just to eat here.2 words: Meat Jun.I just discovered meat jun on a recent trip to Hawaii with my boyfriend.  I'm so happy that he introduced me to this simple yet super tasty dish that I have just fallen completely in love with.  Thank you Jeremy C.!  Every since I had it at 3 different restaurants in Oahu, I had to find one in Vegas.Verdict: Island Style does not disappoint.  It is almost as close to the meat jun served at Millions in Oahu.  Flavorful well season beef inside a hefty egg batter served over white rice or fried rice!  Don't forget to dip it in their tasty sauce for an amazing trip in your mouth!Their dumplings here are a great appetizer too!  And the workers here; I believe a family that used to live in Oahu, are super nice and friendly.  We chopped it up with them about the Islands and food!  My boyfriend and I will definitely be back for the meat jun and to try their other menu items!  They're straight from Hawaii so I'm sure the rest of the food here is legit!  Yum!Eh cuz, we go grind!Food from the 808.  Well kinda.  More like Korean take out and a spam musubi on the side for good measure.  Rant:1.  Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it "Hawaiian".3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me "brah" or asking if I "hang ten" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.How does it stack up?Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys. A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.A-OK.  Kanak attack.  Out.Came here a few weeks ago with some work friends for a goodbye lunch.  Still lots of aloha spirit at Island Style!I was feelin' the Korean vibe that day so I went with a staple, the Bi Bim Bop.  Rice topped with bulgogi beef with lots of veggie sides like pickled carrots & daikon, bean sprouts, spinach, and cucumber, all topped off with a runny sunny side up egg, sesame seeds & seaweed!  Comes with a side of broth too for pouring over.  Delicious!  Love that runny egg yolk combining with the hot rice & bulgogi, then getting the crunch from the cool veggies.  That's some good eats!  I should have opted for a dollar or 2 more for the Bi Bim Bop in the hot stone pot, would have been sizzling hot from beginning to end.Island Style has the hookup for banchan too!  Who else in town served boiled peanuts as banchan?  Such a good start to a meal.  I had no shortage of other banchan either - kim chee, kim chee cucumbers, bean sprouts & more.  Sides to my hearts content!I also got a Cheeseburger as well.  Surprisingly simple & tasty!  Flat top grilled meat, cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce & tomato, bun.  And lots of mayo & ketchup just the way I like it!  Opted for no fries, needed to keep the calorie count down LOL.Island Style I'll be back again when I need me some down home eats!Hawaiian!  Oh....and Korean!
Azteca Mexican Restaurant=Five years later, still good. Azteca has all the stuff you would want in a Mexican restaurant - Telemundo on the television, burritos and tacos, rice and beans, imported beers from south of the border, chips and salsa, and a wait staff that understands enough English to bring you a carne asada with flour tortillas.Food is good. Chips are good. Salsa is good. It's A-OK.
Burrito Bandito=How I love thy beans and rice,The way you're layered is wicked nice,With sour cream and guac galore,F'yeah may I have some more?Oh, and your Carnitas too.And the Bandito Sauce.Please & Thank you.Yep 4 stars to 1 star... new owners need a dose of reality. If the Burrito Bandito website has your store number and address on there still you would imagine that they are the same owners. I guess not. The new owners have different prices different menu items and different customer service skills. As I mentioned in my previous review, I have been eating BB since day one... the day they opened. Yesterday was my last day there EVER... Me: "Do you deliver still?" Her: "Pssshh.. we have for the past 9 months!" Me: "bummer the website did not mention that" Her Blank Stare Me: "Can I have the 3-way chimi, not the combo, with guac? " Her:Rolling eyes.... "That would be a burrito" Me: "I would like it deep fried, Unless the Chimi combo is cheaper? " Her:Rolling eyes..."Huh.... ummm... its a few cents cheaper" (burrito is 4.99 chimi combo is 6.99) Me: "Ok I will have the burrito deep fried with guac on the side." Her: blank stare Me: "I would alos like the kids meal taco" (supposed to be a mini taco, 2 banditos rice and beans) Her: blank stare Me "I would also like the #6" Her: Huh...what else? etc.... 4 more customer come in and order and she was as rude to them as she was me. Not a smile the entire time. I get home: SURPRISE The chimi had no guac on the side... it was inside and the kids meal had NO banditos...So I call... Her: The kids meal does not come with banditos. Me: The website shows...and I read it to her. Her: That is the other store only. Me Then why is you phone and address on there? Her: The owner will not remove it... Me: Ok but you still shorted me my...nevermind....CLICK YOU JUST CAN'T FIX STUPID!!
Mr. Chop Chop=I have to admit, I had probably driven by this place hundreds of times without ever giving it a thought. After all, what kind of authenticity could I expect from a place with such a silly name? Who is this Mr. Chop Chop, and is he the mascot of the restaurant? Well, OBVIOUSLY I was a fool. A silly, misguided fool! Whoever Mr. Chop Chop is, I'd definitely want to be his friend. We've ordered from them twice and its been consistently flavorful and fast. The boy always gets a red curry when we have thai, and the first time he got a Mongolian beef that he enjoyed. Last time we ordered the curry, spicy mint pork, chicken satay, tom yum kai and crab rangoon. The rangoon was fat with cream cheese and a bit of crab, and the wontons were light and crispy. The curry was spicy and had lots of vegetables with juicy bits of chicken. I love tom yum kai and use it as my gauge, and their's was great. It had a definite home-made feel, with big chunks of galangal and lemongrass. The chicken was tender and definitely a lot fresher than some of the other places I've tried. They put strips of jalapeno into the soup and it was definitely spicy! The satay came with a peanut sauce and some sweet vinegar pickles that were delicious! A great compliment to the rich peanut sauce. The pork was also good, with a medley of vegetables and lots of chunks of fresh garlic. The meat was flavorful without being dense or overly porky, and the mint was a great addition. It made the whole dish taste lighter, fresher and more balanced. The delivery was relatively quick, within an hour, and we were very satisfied with the spice level. Most places go easy on it doubting our abilities as caucasians, leaving me to dump chili sauce into it. That was definitely not the case here, my first bite of the tom yum kai was a  shock. So spicy! It was great! I appreciate their generosity with the spice. We only got one rice with the meal, but it was enough for the meal. I may need to make a fresh batch for the leftovers, of which there is plenty. We got a ton of food for about $40 with enough for another meal. If we hadn't been so enthusiastic about trying things, we probably could have gotten a third meal out of it. Yummy food and close to home, I look forward to trying more of their offerings.
Cheng's Express=Worst Chinese food I have ever had by a Chinese owned and run restaurant EVER.  What the hell were their mothers cooking for them when they were kids to think this was passable?     Jenny, Chad, Debra...you're all right.  It was my fault for not looking at any of the reviews until I checked in after picking up my order.  I actually considered bringing this whole bag back for a refund without trying any of it.  Then the Yelper denial kicked in.  I thought "Well...Jenny's review was a few months ago and I ordered different stuff so maybe it will be better.".  Everyone is Chinese here so how bad can it be??  OH BABY IT'S BAD!!! Their "family dinner" special looked so enticing.  You get 2 entrees with soup, pork fried rice, 2 egg rolls and crab rangoon for $24.99.  That usually means leftovers but it actually meant straight to the garbage can in reality.Hot and sour soup:  I'll give them credit for soup being hot.  1 out of 2!  Nice job.  I am not sure how they managed to make the soup bland and very oily but they did.  Chicken and broccoli: The quality of the chicken was rubbery.  My chihuahuas enjoyed it and gave it 3 out of 5 Yelp stars.  Shrimp and garlic sauce:  When was the last time garlic sauce was red and uber-sweet?  Eff you, chef.  Pork fried rice:  The best of the worst and it still lacked a lot of flavor.  I was in such disbelief that I actually called them to let them know how bad it all was.  The person I spoke with said they'd save my phone number and I'd get a free entree the next time I order.  HA!  Maybe if I were contemplating suicide!I would advise all of the reviewers that bestowed 5 Yelp stars to Cheng's Express to avoid Chinese restaurants like KJ's, HK Star and Wendy's Noodle unless you've consulted a neurosurgeon first because your brain would EXPLODE if you ate at any of those spots.
Pasta & Provisions=Lets talk about carbs, baby...Pasta & Provisions does it right. I want to "carb load" every day of my life when I come to this side of town. I have such a hard time coming in here and only buying what I came in for. Guaranteed, I always leave with a least one bag of meat ravioli and one container of meatballs and pomodoro sauce. They have everything labeled and it's easy to find. If you can't, ask someone everyone is super helpful and friendly. I love the family meal deal. Let's be honest - I'm a single girl. The family meal deal feeds me for days - for $20! Winning!! And now it's available every day. Score. I will come here time and time again. There's different daily specials, and we're talking like real "omg. I must come on a Tuesday" specials. Fresh, delicious. Bring your own bag - you won't get in trouble if you don't, but it's appreciated. Lovely, local gem.Eat pasta, run fasta!
Romanelli's Deli & Bakery=Romanelli's is the most amazing italian deli that one can ever come across in Phoenix. It is located down the street from the high school that I went to and we used to stop most days for some cheese pizza or "Italian Stallion" sandwich. Now that I have grown this is a prime place to shop for my own culinary needs such as pastas, cold cuts, pizza toppings, sauces and even hommade pizza dough just waiting to be thawed and used to make your own delicious pizzas.I still stop in for the occassional sandwish and the "Italian Stallion" is still my top choice. Ham, capicolla,  grnoa salami, pepperoni and provalone cheese piles high with onions thinnly shredded lettuce tomatoes and of course bread soggy with dressing as it should be. And don't forget to follow it up with your favorite italian sweet. I haven't had a bad dessert yet.The service is prompt and charmingly brusque. A real New York feeling here. If its authenticity you are after this is your place..anywhere else? Fuggedaboudit!!OMG Korina A is crazy!!!! I followed Nathan and Kris. Romanellis is OUTSTANDING!!!! Delicious subs I will be back again and again. I will tell all my friends this is delish! You have to try the Italian sausage sub YUMMMMMMM!I love the meats and cheeses and the atmosphere. You can get anything you like Italian in this joint. LOVE IT! Right up the street from my house can't be beat!This must be my lucky month. I'm discovering more and more places that serve foods that remind me of my favorite stomping grounds in NYC. I've been to Romanelli's earlier this year, on March 19 - the feast of St. Joseph, to see if they sold those wonderful special filled zeppoles named after the saint and sold in Italian bakeries and food stores on his feast day. They did, and the pastries were delicious. I also browsed the packaged and canned goods areas and found lots of high quality Italian foods not normally found in supermarkets and regular food stores. But it was today after reading the reviews here that I decided to try the deli. I ordered the Italian Stallion sub and it was really, really good! The meats were very high quality, fresh and ample, and there was just enough lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, and dressing to enhance the flavors without competing with the deli meats. It's so good to know that there is a great deli place not far from where I live, and where I can treat myself to or bring visiting friends for a great New York style deli experience.Is this the best Italian Deli / Bakery that I've ever been to? No. Is this the best one in the Valley area? Absofrigginlutely!!! This is the ONLY place that I know of in this metro area that you can select from eight varieties/brands of San Marzano Tomatoes. If you have to ask why that is significant enough to merit 5 stars... then I can only imagine that you haven't spent decades attempting to perfect your Pomodoro or Pizza Sauce. Combine this with the fact that they almost always have Rainbow cookies available and some of the best fresh Italian breads, and you have achieved two-thirds of an almost idyllic Italian meal. Before you leave the store, make sure you take a leisurely stroll along the back wall. This is what I like to consider a little piece of heaven on earth. Every imaginable cheese / meat you've ever heard uttered by the Mario's, Lydia's, and Giada's of this world can be found in the case that runs the entire length of the store. Want to create an out of this world antipasto selection for your next get together? Seriously if you can't find it in that case, you are trying to live up to Captain Jack Harkness standards, and although I adore him... he is a work of fiction! And I have to agree with Nathan; they make one hell of a sandwich, but I've never sampled any of their other eat in/take out items, so my input is limited on that side of the house. This is not a "pretty" place. It's not trendy or new and it is located in yet another strip mall. But it is a fully functional, family run, local business that is operated by two of the nicest guys you would ever want to meet. As far as quality and friendliness goes, this place rocks! I discovered Romanelli's about 25 years ago (remember... it's not polite to ask a girl's age) and let's just say, they had me at ciao. : )Can't wait to have a real reason to go back here. We were doing a foodie market tour today and this was suggested as our last stop( my buddy Tom had to take home fresh cannolis home to the womenfolk). My plan is to go back for delicious sub sandwiches since this place is close to work . Why haven't gotten lunch here already ?  They have great Italian grocery supplies like the Stella Dora cookies I remember as a kid living in Jersey.  I also perused the San Marino tomatoes and pondered the differences from "regular" canned tomatoes. At 7.00 bucks a can I guess I won't ever know. I rather spend my money on baked goodies in the front case. My husband , the wonderful Michael  surprised me with a eclair . You know he loves me!Maybe in the early 80's this was the coolest shnitzel in the 'hood, but now it's just plain spaghetto.Really not impressed at all.Tiny portions.  Mediocre quality, at best.  Too much bread($) for not enough meat(meat).This place is riding on its reputation, but where it got its rep, i'm not sure.If you're a fan, then hey, more for you.  I'm not coming back unless someone makes me an offer i can't refuse.This place has been here for over 35 years, not a lot of time on the East coast. But, here in AZ where no building lasts for more than 60 years , it is astonishing!True right up front, it is in a rough hood. But, maybe you should just go during the day.The selection here in the Groceries is without comparison. They have everything Italian you could want.....Imported from Italy. Of course.They make their own sausage there,(you can buy it in the meat case.) It is by far, THE BEST we have ever had any where.It even drove the dog crazy when I just brought it in the house. The smell is so good! The choices for the food and cook ware,as well as gifts are fantastic. I have not been able to eat lunch there but ,next time we will. So far the first 3 times have just been Grocery shopping.I live just over 50 miles round trip from this Deli , Bakery. Every mile is worth it.I cannot believe I had never been here till October.I have since recommended it to every Italian I know. Oh yes, it is that good.If I could give them 10 stars ,I would.
Mineo's Pizza House=The current star rating of 3.5 stars is incredibly accurate of Mineo's.  I'm going to be unpopular and round up to 4 stars because I think Mineo's is a more unique pizza than other places in Pittsburgh.  You're going to be indifferent or love it.  I'm confused about my emotions, clearly.Disclaimer:  I did not order a pie here, only two slices.Mineo's crust is unique.  It's thin but not like cheap Pizza Hut burnt-to-a-crisp-thin pizza.  It's almost like the dough doesn't rise the whole way or something, but it worked for me.  The sauce was ok, not too special.  But I love cheese, and this pizza was swimming in cheese.  It was pretty fast for my two slices to come out, and at $1.70/slice, not terribly priced.I actually had really friendly service while I was there so I'm not sure about those complaints.  The tables were a little dirty and some weirdos were sitting inside.  Not pizza items were super slow, but it's not a huge kitchen.  I wasn't totally shocked by that.  I would come back here for a few slices on a laid-back night.Cash OnlyI stopped by on Tues. for a quick dinner of a couple slices on my way to a gathering in Squirrel Hill. I'd tried Mineo's pizza before several years ago, and I remembered enjoying it, but it'd been long enough that I'd forgotten the specifics. Thus, my visit gave me the opportunity to retry and review this legendary pie.I ordered two plain cheese slices ($3.40), which only took about 5 min. to warm up. Upon biting into them, they seemed promising due to the generous helping of cheese and crispy crust (my personal pizza hangup). However, upon tasting the flavors, I was let down. This is one of the blandest pizzas I've ever tasted--the sauce was nearly flavorless, and the crust tasted like cardboard and had an odd texture (definitely not thin, but not really pan style, either).  The only flavor I clearly tasted was the cheese, which was accompanied by a greasy aftertaste.  Even the addition of oregano and garlic powder did little to increase the complexity of the flavors.  How disappointing!While the price and service were right, unfortunately, the pizza failed to measure up--esp. in light of my past experience, not to mention the numerous awards Mineo's has won over the years.  Based on those factors and some of the other Yelp reviews, it seems that Mineo's has gone downhill.  At any rate, I'll stick to Aiello's for the time being, and will keep searching for the magic perfect pie-in-the-sky pizza in Sq. Hill.
Mariscos Chihuahua=To my utter surprise, this place is fantastic. I'll be honest in the fact that these holes in the wall scare me a bit since I have no idea what to expect. I have driven by this seafood spot for a couple of years and always laughed at the name. Last night, I was in the mood for Mexican and the hubby in the mood for seafood and something healthy. I really wanted chips and guacamole, which by the looks of the menu, they do not sell. No matter as I am always a sucker for some ceviche. There were seafood dishes galore and prices ranging from inexpensive (my small shrimp ceviche $5) to mixed seafood dishes for $18. Some of the more expensive dishes are offered as a daily special which can save you a few bucks on certain days. Our food came with tostada shells and per my request, avocado on the side ($2). It was a small whole avocado cut in half so very fresh. My ceviche was awesome, especially with the avocado. My husband had a crabmeat tostada and I was amazed at the amount of crabmeat piled on the top. My husband felt there was a 1/4 pound of crab meat on that thing. The food felt and tasted very fresh, too. Again, this spot was great. I tried to drop subtle hints to go back tonight but the husband wasn't having it. Maybe I'll try again tomorrow or the next day, or the next day.....
Ground Zero=INT: Ground Zero - Day. Barista yelps behind counter.BARISTA: Does somebody have a red Nissan Juke parked across the street? The city is towing your car.Exit Corey. Frazzled. Oy. EXT: Curbside. Wide shot. Tow Truck. The Jew & His Juke. Traffic Cop. COREY: Oh my gosh are there parking restrictions here? I saw a bunch of cars parked across from the cafe and figured it was ok.TRAFFIC COP: You see that sign that says no parking 4:00-5:30. POV: Sign. COREY: Oh man.TRAFFIC COP: What time is it? POV: Watch.COREY: 4:18.EXT: Willy Street. No cars parked. TRAFFIC COP: We need both lanes to keep traffic moving from 4:00-5:30. COREY: Shoot. I just moved here, been here for 3 days. I'm really sorry. TRAFFIC COP: What do you think of the car? You like it? COREY: It's great!TRAFFIC COP: I'll go ahead and exit out of this screen. (POV: Ticket Generator.) That way you won't have to pay the towing fee, just the $45 parking citation. COREY: Ok, I appreciate that. TRAFFIC COP: So seriously, anything you don't like about this car? I'm going to get one. END.Thanks Ground Zero barista. Because of you I didn't have to go find my car last week. Because of you I could stay and work (which is awesome thanks to free WIFI, ample tables and strategic outlets) while I sipped on the best cold brew I've found in Madison. The search continues, but after four places, you guys are tops!
Nevada Chicken Cafe=Nevada Chicken Café catered my companys Christmas Party and man did they bring a TON of food.They do Chicken-rotissere-grilled chicken-a little dry compared to El Pollo Loco but good non the less.They also had ribs which were VERY tough & dry.Definitely would NOT do the ribs again.The side were a little bland & boring-mac-n-cheese,some orange looking rice and salads.They have great prices so it may be worth checking out again when its NOT catered but made to order.Right off the bat this place was annoying. The line doesn't start where it says it does, there was a 20 minute wait for chicken and a 30 minute wait for ribs. There was no ice and they were out of lemonade (I don't drink soda). The food was good but with the hassle of everything else I can't say it was worth it. The staff was kind of rude and stared a lot, which was very annoying.Yeah, I probably won't go back.
Goodcents Subs & Pastas=Their sign says the nicest place on earth or was it happiest....wait thats Disneyland. I think. Anyway, the folks behind the counter are very nice and helpful. I like that they have pasta here and the meat is sliced right in front of your eyes if your into that sort of thing. Everything always looks really fresh even today at 4 pm. I have been coming here forever and will continue to do so.
Baja Fresh Las Vegas=Once upon a time I was a huge fan of this Baja Fresh location.  My coworkers and I  use to come here all the time for lunch.  Then, about 4 yrs ago I noticed a rapid decline in their food quality.  Their Chips started to become thinner and not so fresh.  Their Beef didn't taste as good.  And when they started posting nutritional info online.....I was afraid, very afraid.    Most of my favorite dishes here had a gazillion calories!  Oh no!Well, every once in a while I'll visit an old friend and have a Beef Burrito.  Was at this location recently and enjoyed one for lunch.  Nothing special though.Will I return?  Possibly.
The Red Herring Vegetarian Restaurant=All I want is for this place to do well.  It deserves it.Basically, if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs, you'll enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center.  And by speakeasy, I don't mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners, I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies--the best kind of speakeasy. :)The decor is eclectic and homemmade.  It basically looks like a co-op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters: hipsters, professors, crunchy folk, punkers, and any person who likes great food.I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today--Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage.  Otherwise, you should enjoy.Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it.  Good call. :)One note, they only take cash, much like the Y-Thai.  But really, if you're eating on campus, you should spend your money on places like Y-Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless, corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown.And there's free wifi.  Hot damn.
Sardella's Pizza & Wings=Saredella's Ultimate.  Memories of a time gone by.Back in the late eighties, my high school friends and I would hold regular Thursday evening get togethers to watch Married With Children and The Simpsons on the fledgeling Fox network....and we always ordered a Sardella's Ultimate:Large Cheese Pizza and 50 wings for 11.99 (back then).Oh sure, they still sell pizza, and they stil sell wings, but over the years they've gone from a super fresh neighborhood REAL pizza parlor (this is THE original location) to a generic, uneven quality "local-chain" of pizza stores. No fancy ingredients: the last time I tried to get a Hawaiian style, they had no Canadian bacon, only ham, not as slices, but tiny diced bits with a yucky flavor, and just as oily as pepporoni would have been, anyway.  No artichoke or banana peppers or anything like that either.On the positive, they do have cheap deals, and are regular sponsors of local kids' sports teams and other community stuff.  I remember getting a coupon for a free medium pizza when I moved into my house.I wish the Sardella's family continued success, but hope that someone within recognizes that their restaurants just aren't what they used to be.2.5 for the pizza 3.5 for the wings 5 for the way it used to be... Let me take you back to 1988 on the corner of 19th Ave and Union Hills Rd. There was a Safeway, Walgreen's and Sardellas. They were the new kids to the hood. My wonderful Momz and I were next door getting some useless crap from Walgreen's and the hunger hit. Momz always liked a good pizza. We walk into a tiny 1 suite pad and ask for 2 slices of pizza. Mr Sardella (totally Broken English and all) said " I'll-a give-a you-a a whole pie-a if ya tell-a me what-you think-a" Momz was no dummy she raised 4 kids, pizza never went to waste. We get the whole pie and man was it chewy... no flavor and meh. She tells the guy and he starts yelling and hitting David Sardella, " I tol-a you, you touch it too much-a" It was the funniest thing ever. Momz ordered pizza from them for over 7 year EVERY Friday for Daycare and several more times a month for dinners. My wife ordered from there for almost 10 years EVERY Friday and for huge get togethers we would order Sardellas. BUT ALAS.... The pizza got stingy, no great flavor, no great appeal. In fact they are now serving Deer Vally School's the lunches on Monday Wed and Friday. Sardellas has become "school lunch" boo Go get a Garlic cheese bread and some wings but skip the pizza. They do serve the Deer Valley Schools well, always giving money or hosting events, and I thank them for continuing to give back to the community.
Sammy's Deli Restaurants=Sammy's Deli looks like a simple, unassuming burger joint more than a deli. It's the kind of place that you drive by a few times, look at the quaint exterior and sign and pass because you already know of a great burger place that you can count on. One rainy day while I got my oil changed at nearby Meineke, I decided to give Sammy's a try.The menu is reasonably priced, ranging from your typical burgers, sandwiches and salads from basic to the ones with lots of fixin's. The interior isn't very notable. Order up at the register, walk by their open kitchen, and take a seat at one of the vinyl booths with a formica table.   Los Angeles would snap up this authentic old cafe style restaurant and throw in some new modern light fixtures, fill in a cool color scheme to make it less sterile, and hire lots of hot waiters and waitresses. But, Sammy's keeps it real. What you see is what you get, no pretension. It was busy, but no long lines, just a few tables of fireman and local folks. My cheeseburger was surprisingly pretty good. Well-cooked, well-seasoned, a soft bun and pretty satisfying. Fries were also good. One of the cook's (possibly an owner) came out and asked how we liked things. He was very friendly and not overbearing. We traded tips on nixing computer viruses and spyware.  Sammy's food is solid and is a good alternative to the beaten path joints.
Shootz Cafe & Billiards=I'm surprised that this place isn't more packed.If it was in SF - it would be poppin'.Shootz has everything you could want in a local hangout spot. It's big. Huge actually. It has an eccentric lamp in the shape of a woman wearing all black. It has cheap drink specials. It has guest radio and local DJ's bumping out good stuff all night. It serves up food. It hosts Karaoke and poker nights. And it's a quality pool hall ( minus the plethora of broken cues - you'll find everywhere)The nice thing about Shootz is that it's never too busy.There's a consistent crowd of regulars who like to shoot their pool and hang out - but you can nearly always score a table, and can always count on a diverse group of people to be there.There's something extremely heart-warming to me about walking into a pool hall, while Mariah Carey spins from the DJ table, and there are two girls sporting their Uggs, as they argue about the best angle to hit the 8 ball in.
Showmars Restaurant=So I walk into Shomars and observe that there are two registers with two opposite personalities. In one register, jolly man. Behind the other register, grumpy man. As fate would have it, my order was taken by grumpy man. He was in a hurry, barking inquiries. It's fascinating because I think he might be one of the owners. "No Hummus!" he barked at my question. Got it! Moving right along. The no hummus retort made me think the gyros might be boring, so I went with the All-American Pita Burger. The Pita Burger was a delightful choice, served in pita bread with three thin patties, yellow-American cheese, lettuce and tomato. It hit the spot and is pretty unique to me. First All-American Pita Burger I've had at least. I'm craving one just writing about it!Anyway--check Mr. Grumpy's out!
Pewter Rose Bistro=What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. The seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D
Barb's Country Kitchen=Cute little diner hidden on a curve between lower and upper Lawrenceville. We came here for Sunday brunch, craving some delicious breakfast food.  I think I almost had a heart attack at how CHEAP it was.  For barely $4 you get eggs, a choice of meat and toast.  I mean, seriously!I actually opted for the Country Omelet, which was ham and provolone cheese, onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was an packed omelet with a crap ton of cheese!  It had to be like 3 or 4 slices!  It also came with home fries and wheat toast.  The home fries were okay, but I like crispier slices than what I got.  The service was extremely friendly.  Seriously went out of their way to check on you, get things for you and just be plain nice!  It is incredibly appreciated.I discovered no paper towels in the the bathroom and told the server.  She whispered to me that they don't keep paper towels in the bathroom anymore, but at the front counter.  Apparently people were stuffing them in the toilet.  Um, whoever is doing that, stop it!  I want paper towels in the bathroom!Hot Tip: They DO accept credit cardsIn the summer it looks like they have a super cute patio to sit out on!
La Piñata=Awesome neighborhood place! After scoping out possible places to dine in this area on yelp we settled on La Pinata because of the promising reviews about their stellar enchiladas! Never one to miss up on a good enchilada, we gave it a go and were very happy!!The salsa was good, as were the chips, they kept 'em coming! I especially loved the lady with the salsa in a pitcher who wandered around the dining room giving our lil bowl refills on the regular! The tacos were awesome and so were the enchiladas!! YES! The food was fantastic, our only complaint was that the service was shit. We had this guy as our waiter, sorry didn't catch his name but he was ignoring us like CRAZY! We'd call for him, he'd give us the errect index finger asking for a minute and would never come! We didn't get refills on our sodas, until we asked for them from the salsa chick! Other tables that were seated after we arrived got their food before us and were out the door before us because he kept forgetting to bring us our check! We weren't especially rude, but after being fed up, I asked him if he was slammed that day. I knew he wasn't because there were three servers and about 12 tables filled, that's around 4 tables each and most of his other tables were just drinking and hanging out. He said no, and I asked then why are you ignoring us? No apology, nothing. He just laughed and walked away and kept on ignoring us. We tipped the salsa chick, paid and then left!The food is AWESOME! don't get me wrong... but the service is reeeeally awful. Or atleast this guy was. The other servers seemed to be doing a better job. To my yelpers, I say: if you want good neighborhood mexican, go here. That is, If you have a lot of time on your hands and are very patient with crappy service. If you have neither of these things, then don't fret - there are PLENTY of other places nearby!All hail the Arizona cheese crisp and this instituation that has been around since 1970 still makes a great one.This most recent trip to Phoenix for the Jewish New Year left me longing to visit my Grandfather's grave along with my Great Aunt Florence and my Great Uncle Marshall. In order to go to the cemetery, we have to go through what is now a "sketchy part of town" but a part that I used to be more familiar with when I was younger. Since we were going on our way to the airport, I suggested to my Mom that we go to LP for lunch so I could get my cheese crisp fix and see if my childhood memories of this place lived up. The Synagogue I grew up going to was close to LP. La Pinata was the first "real" Mexican food restaurant I ate at and the only one my Grandparent's would go to since they never really cared for Mexican food but did like cheese crisps and chimichangas. My Great Uncle had his 50th birthday party here in 1976 and I was there. Yes, there is history. Most importantly, when we arrived around 2pm on Saturday afternoon, there were mostly empty tables and the decor was the same as I remembered it. Our waiter was super nice, we ordered the cheese crisp and it came out crispy, and piping hot. For those of you who don't know what a cheese crisp is, imagine a giant tortilla topped with cheese then baked or put under a broiler for a few minutes and sliced in triangles like a pizza. It is awesome and something I make at home but it is not quite the same. My mom ordered a spinach enchilada a la carte, I had a side of refried (lardy kind) beans and rice and the daughter had the lunch portion of steak fajitas (huge portion). Lunch menu is available M-Sat which is a very nice thing to know. Is this the best Mexican food ever? No. Did the taste and my memory hold up? Yes. Will I be back-DEFINITELY! Thank you La Pinata for being at least one thing that hasn't changed in Phoenix...
Jb's=If I say it wasn't as bad as I was expecting is that good?  2.5 stars.I have only eaten at a JB's once.  That was in Price, UT probably 3 or 4 years ago.  It was memorably bad.  So when I offered to pick up lunch for an employee and they picked this place I was expecting the worst.  I went in with diminished expectations.I played it safe with a BLT, fries and a shake.  It was OK!  Yay!  The BLT was actually almost....well...pretty good.  Hey that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!
La Parrilla Suiza=I moved very near this restaurant about a year and a half ago.  The first time we tried it, we loved it enough to keep going back several times.  The food was delicious and original -- not what you get at a typical generic americanized mexican restaurant.  The place has really gone down hill a lot in a short time.The latest time we went will also probably be the last time we go.  The food simply stank.  Everything came with a pile of hard purple cabbage, which unlike the typical but useful pile of lettuce&tomatoes, was nothing more than garnish.  (this cabbage can be seen in just about all of the photos others have posted)  Dishes that had been consistently good over several visits were suddenly changed, and not for the better.  My daughter's shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it used to be, and if she's going to order something that costs more than what I order, It'd better be worth it, dammit!I know Parrilla Suiza has long been considered agreat place, and not your typical mexican restaurant, but it just isn't the case anymore.  I am curious if any other former long-time customers are recently feeling the same?I've been to this La Parrila Suiza a couple of times now. I keep getting invited by some friends to join them in this Mexico City food fest.  They love this place so I've hesitant in writing this review but after our last meal I feel I must "spill the beans"...Service ~ They are really friendly and helpful when ordering but they are very slow. I mean, come on!  You can only play "eye spy" so many times before you loose interest in why your there to begin with.  The only... and I mean only reason we did not leave was due to their tri-salsa dippage action with crispy chips.  It is really one salsa a pico de gallo and a green creamy kinda of dipFood ~ Chicken flautas were ok, three of them fried, topped with sour cream and Piquillo sauce served with rice, guacamole cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw and beans were not goo at all.  We also had the Chicken Melt which was very good but we were shorted one of the tortillas!  It was supposed to be two flour tortillas filled with melted cheese, chicken bacon, avocado and tomatoes, topped with cheese and a sauce. It also came with their beans rice and cole slaw.  It took so long to get our order we didn't bother saying anything...Our last order was a chicken taco salad.  It was HUGE and served in a very crisp tortillas bowl.  The salad was tossed with all of the ingredients which was different.  I enjoy separating some of the chicken, cheese and other goodies in the salad bowl, but with this salad you could not do that ~ it was all tossed together.  The chicken was very cold and tasted blah. The bland dressing was also tossed into the salad which made this thing a big bowl of mushy lettuce, yuk-a-roo.So if your meeting a friend and they are buying this might be a good place for you to go.
Pullano's Pizza & Wings=Having recently moved to the neighborhood, I'm on the prowl for a new pizza place. I was looking for one that delivered, but Pullano's is close enough for pick up, and I read good things about it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.I probably should have stuck with pizza. But we were in the mood for a full, homestyle meal. We ordered a veal parmesan, a chicken parmensan, two wedding soups, and a burger for the kid. The fact that they had burgers should have been a minor warning sign. The fact that they also have a full Mexican food menu should have been a great big honkin' neon sign.Like most places in the Valley, Pullano's is tucked in a shabby strip mall. Inside, it's very cheery and friendly. The walls are chocked full of sports memorabilia from the local teams they support, as well as some knickknacks, and TVs airing sports. It's been around a while, and that made it rather comfortable and neighborhoody.The staff was all smiles, and after a short wait, had my food ready to go. The price for our meal was around $30. Not bad.Once I got it home and unwrapped it, well, yeah. The veal parm was one of those chopped and re-formed patties, dowsed in a bland tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella. The chicken was an actual chicken breast, served in the same way, but had the texture of a dog's chew toy (not that I've actually tried one.)On a bright note, the italian wedding soup was really rather good. In fact, we have toyed with the idea of ordering from Pullano's again -- but just soup and garlic bread. Or maybe a pizza.Let's call a spade a spade; there's really not that much that separates Pullano's from any of its competition, of which there is plenty. There's a Hungry Howie's down 51st street, a Ballpark Pizza on Thunderbird, Pizza by Napoli in the opposite direction on T-bird, and a Domino's practically across the street. They all make pizza. They all make hot wings. They will all make your intestines hate you.What sets Pullano's apart from the others is the atmosphere. Pullano's is a fun place to be. There are giant TVs all over the place, blaring whatever sporting event is going on. The walls are covered with team paraphernalia and the occasionally offensive but amusing show of patriotism (like a picture of an F-16 with a guy on a magic carpet shopped in).Pullano's is the perfect place to bring large groups of people. The staff  seems to even prefer the larger groups, probably because they tip better. The menu has lots of specials that cater to large tables. Depending on the day, you can get two for one pizza deals or a large with 30 wings. The wings are a little on the crispy side, but you never get the wimpy little "mini wings" that places like Buffalo Wild Wings or Domino's try to screw you with when you order large batches. The pizza's chock full of grease, but it's filling and tastes pretty damn good. I recommend the Chicken Alfredo pizza if you ever get a chance. On Wednesdays it's two for one, last I checked.I'm sure there's other stuff on the menu, but I wouldn't bother. It's a pizza place. There's a reason why nobody buys tacos at Burger King.This pizza place reminds me of my childhood in the burbs of Chi-town. It's a warm and friendly place to be with multiple TVs blaring the current football game, patrons and fans cheering with every touchdown and piping hot pizza right from the oven! They even have 2-4-1 meal nights! This is the place for your pitcher of bud and your favorite team jersey, Oh, and don't worry, no need to dress up or find yourself a baby sitter.
Ishi Japanese Restaurant=I visited Ishi tonight with some fellow yelpers (Megan P., BJ S, and Sam P) tonight and I was pleasantly surprised with the selection even if the inside was a bit grungy :) .  Our waitress was great - she had some awesome recommendations and I was very very pleased with her suggestions. I was barely able to eat the two rolls I ordered there was so much food and the display was very aesthetically pleasing!  I'd honestly rate this as a 3.5 experience, but because the service was great, I bumped it to 4.   If you are in the university area and want a low key sushi place, I'd recommend swinging by.3.49 stars it is. They seemed to have a pretty big sushi selection. However, not being much of a sushi lover, they had a good selection of hibachi entrees to choose from. i was content with the cost of my Ishi Shrimp selection ($7.25 plus 50 cents to add zucchini). The portion size was exactly right as I cleaned my plate and left with a full belly. Not to mention, it was solidly delicious.I did try one of Mrs. P's sushi and i could barely get it all in my mouth, it was ginormous (twss). It wasn't too shabby tasting. The interior of Ishi was kind of an ishi (as in issue...anyone? ...mrs. p?), although I was amused with the look of the sushi bar area (like a thatch roof Tiki vibe going on). The place actually had the appearance of a former Mexican restaurant and would probably not be the sushi place you go to impress a date. However, i thought our service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly, helpful with suggestions and they were always on top of our water refills. We even got a fancified orange at the end of the meal and  mints with the check.. We do not venture to this area often enough to likely make a return trip but it was a very satisfying dinner.Beer drinker note: Bud light, Miller Lite, Coors  $2.00Sam Adams bottle, Blue Moon  $2.50Heineken, Corona $2.75Sapporo, Kirin $3.00
Stratosphere Buffet=This was my first time ever eating at this location.So many other good buffets that are a lot better than this one.Several different stations of different food stations throughout the buffet area.I would have to say that the only thing I really enjoyed was the craving station.The had a Tri-Tip steak and it was delicious,along with some mashed potatoes and gravy and a corn on the cob.The salad bar was in two different area's of the Buffet.Fresh fruit on side and the other side had all the condiments for your salad on the other side.The desert station was in the middle and their where a lot of different desert's.My favorite where the cupcakes and the carrot cake.The Buffet came with all you can eat and your choice of beverage.Alcohol was an additional cost The Buffet cost $19.95 per person and if you had a rewards card from Stratosphere and enough points you could receive 25 percent off.The employees that are working the floor where very nice and very attentive.
Olive Garden Italian Restaurant=Yep another chain and though I have eaten at many OG's over the years, have never been a huge fan. Had lunch here on a Thursday with Gma, mom, and daughter towards the late side of the lunching hour. For some reason, there was a wait, and the dining room was crowded. Long story short, 2 of us returned our meals as they were nasty. Breadsticks and salad are still good but unfilled iced tea, weird service, etc. makes this one chain we will never visit again while in the area.
Tokyo Japanese Restaurant=Konichiwa LV yelpers!I'm always on a quest to find new japanese restaurants to add to my where to eat for dinner list.Thanks for all of the awesome yelp reviews on TJR! I finally got to try TJR a week ago with one of my gf.As for the food we order. We ordered the chicken teriyaki & tempura combo with the hawaiian and crunch roll. Food was delicious... along with the complimentary miso soup and edamame.Everything went well, except a comment our waitress made when I asked for more edemame. I mean really?! I don't think it's costing them a lot of money to fill our little bowl with more edemame. When I asked if we could have a little more, she commented back with, it's only for service... (meaning they don't give more then 1 serving) I've been to other restaurants who never had a problem giving me a refill... just saying.Dinner for 2 cost us around $40 not including tip.Indoor seating. Located in an old building in an off the strip area. Nothing fancy, whole in a wall type of place with authentic japanese food. I did get lost for a split minute trying to look for then hidden gem... look for their blue sign. There was no wait on Saturday night around 8pm and the restaurant was surprisingly on the empty side.First place I've stumbled upon in Vegas where the waitress was dressed in kimonos. Love sitting in the wooden booth... very japanesezy,I would love to come back here again to try more... despite our rude waitress...Great place to come with friends, date or family night.If you're looking for a japanese spot off the strip... stop by TJR.I'll be back to explore my options and ask for a refill on edamame! arigato.Party of five, six rolls, veggie tempura, miso soup for all, and three big Sapparo beers ended up being $20 per person. Not bad! We sat in a long booth and it wasn't crowded at all on a Saturday night. Friendly service. I believe they are Korean owned.I recommend what we had:Mexican roll (SO SPICY!)Hawaiian roll Popcorn roll (LOBSTER)Crunch rollPhilly rollThis place was recommended by a Vegas native who is well-traveled so I trusted he knew what good sushi rolls were like. We spent about 20 minutes trying to look for this place. It's behind all the buildings, in a building in the middle of the lot. Plenty of parking.Visited Tokyo a few weeks ago when meeting up with a friend for lunch.  I'd suggested Komol for that heavenly herbal salad, but the friend wanted to try Tokyo instead.  I almost bailed but decided I'd go to Tokyo with him, and if I wasn't impressed I'd simply call Komol for an herbal salad to go.That wasn't necessary.On the outside I saw a big sign advertising their all you can eat prices.  I don't recall exactly what it was, but it seemed pretty standard pricing for a lunch AYCE ($21 or so).  I'll be honest, I don't really enjoy going to sushi restaurants unless I order AYCE.  It just bothers me to order rolls for $8-$12 a piece when I'm so used to the comfort of ordering and ordering and ordering and ordering knowing I'm paying one set price.  There's too much to choose from that I want to eat, that my brain can't handle having to pick and choose a few select items.  That being said, I treated myself to a more expensive lunch than I'm used to, to fully allow myself to enjoy the experience.I could never accurately describe everything I ate, but I must say I enjoyed nearly each and every item.  My order consisted of a handful of rolls, 3-4 orders of nigiri, and some side items like miso soup, gyoza, and a small piece of salmon teriyaki.  All of the fish tasted fresh and the side items were prepared as I'm used to at my favorite AYCE places like Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway with the exception of maybe the salmon teriyaki which seemed overcooked to me.So give Tokyo a visit if you're into AYCE sushi, and if you don't like it as much as I did, remember you always have Komol next door.Same name, same bat channel, and still serving fresh seafood, but now with the AYCE lunch ($21.95, 11:45am to 3pm) and dinner ($26.95 and starts at 3pm) options. It really is a no brainer to head over here for some Japanese cuisine if you are in the neighborhood.  The sushi chefs that were working tonight are not the A-crew (death in the family prevented the boss from being there this week), but the food prepared and served looked wonderful and tasted great.Highlights of the dinner AYCE (typically not served elsewhere or items worthy of a special shout out):6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore, white fish)6 pieces of spicy sashimiUni Shooter (usually not on the AYCE menu; packs a little heat)Korean B.B.Q. Ribs - operated by Koreans,so they know their kalbi.Fresh Scallop (Hotategai) - can't be torched, but it was very good.Fresh OysterMushroom Yaki (Grilled King Oyster Mushroom with Butter)I ordered most of my usual sushi and special requested some hand roll (temaki), that the sushi chefs were able to accommodate without missing a beat.Service was good.  The waitstaff cleared away the used plates and refilled the beverage without prompting.Would I recommend this restaurant? You betcha!4 stars.Ladies and Gentlement, Start Your Engines!  You have 90 minutes to eat at the Tokyo Japanese Restaurant AYCE menu!  Ready-Set-Go!!!My cousins were in town from Hawaii and we all wanted to get some Japanese food, but didn't want to fight the crowds at the large popular hotel chains.  Tokyo Restaurant is located about 1-2 miles off the main strip. First thing you need to know is that this restaurant is more home-style cooking. Restaurant owner, Becky, was a nice but a firm Korean lady.  She has owned the restaurant for 9 years.    I ordered the AYCE Dinner ($26.95) and was given a 90 minute time limit on my meal.  No problem.   All dishes are mini tapa-style plates, and the sushi orders are about 1/2 size of what is normally given in regular sushi bars.  Fun, as you can try many different things with plates this size.  Eat, to the pumping sounds of ABBA playing in the background.Sashimi Plate:  A combination of hamachi, maguro, salmon, tai snapper, and several other fishes.  This was probably the highlight of my meal.  Nice fish and beautifully presented.  Grade:  A-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#kg6j-ewkDX6ygzsDtUuRUQGrilled Hamachi:  A 3"x3" piece of grilled Hamachi yellowfin tuna.  The fish was a bit tough, not because it was over-cooked.  I don't know if it was the quality piece of meat.  Grade:  Chttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#RPqgVOKjCs6iB2G4aCXhhgGrilled Saba:  A 3"x3" piece of mackerel grilled.  Nice flavor, but again, may not have been the quality piece of meat.

It's a few pieces of fish sashimi tossed in korean hot paste, served on a bed of lettuce.  Fun to eat.  Grade:  BSpicy Tuna Sushi:   Bits of tuna mixed with spicy sauce. Little flavor.

Another one of my least favorite dishes.  The shrimp was tough and chewy.  Grade:  Chttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#cAB5ziDvm1ss_OaT4RiNaQGarlic Ahi sushi:   WAHOO!  This was the bomb!

Nice.  Grade:  B-Amaebi / Sweet Shrimp:  Two pieces of sweet shrimp sushi, accompanied by it's heads being fried.   The shrimp was a bit old-tasting, but yet still fun to eat.

Grade:  C+http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tokyo-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#QrhveoJdp82xp_zkX4Z4DgThe meal comes with ice cream - vanilla, green tea, and a few others.What I liked best about the restaurant, was that it was a family-owned environment.  Everyone is welcomed.  One of the female patrons sitting at the sushi bar stood up and shouted.  Then she went around the sushi bar and ended up head-butting her head on the glass counter.   This caused 7-8 glasses of Sake-Beer shooter glasses (*prepared by the sushi chef) to foam immensely.  Everyone at the bar, including the sushi chefs, yelled GAMBATTE and everyone grabbed a glass and shot the sake-beer drink.  Lady - I hope your head is OK as that was a pretty big bang on the sushi bar.  Impressive!Food Grade:  B / B+Service Grade:  A-  (Thanks, Aaron!)Worth the money Grade:  B+Overall Impression:
The Roasting Company=In the couple of years since I last visited, the Roasting Company has added a "taproom" area where they have table service AND BEER. I had no idea!The chicken is still absolutely great. Moist and tasty. I'd recommend the chicken and black bean con queso. Or one of the chicken pot pies if they haven't sold out. Add a scoop of salsa (mild, hot or very hot) from their salsa bar.Other than the beer menu (and spirits too), there is a Coke fountain and urns of sweet/unsweet tea.While planning my trip I was checking out many of my old favorites, some are gone, many are still flourishing like the Roasting Company. I lived in the neighborhood and would eat here regularly like 2-3 times a week. Imagine my surprise to find they had finally opened the place up and added a full bar and doubled the size of the menu, all to the betterment of their devoted customers.I was all smiles when I saw that my all time favorite "smoked cheese pasta salad" was still featured, I got an extra order to take back to the hotel. The rotisserie chicken is still the star here, crispy on the outside, juicy and luscious in the inside. All the sides are great, there are 18 to choose from, something for everybody. Free refills, that beautiful classic salsa bar, and and endless supply of hot sauce and their special Tico sauce. The service is always fast, the food is consistently great, I never understood why these guys haven't expanded beyond Montford Drive because this business would thrive anywhere. Also a great place to watch a ballgame now since the expansion. Got a really nice vibe now.BTW, I was amused at some of the negative reviews. Are you people insane? And BTW, occasionally Yelp does listen cause I flagged one review that raved about the food, but gave the restaurant one star because she had to "refill my own tea" so if you see any of your favorite places being abused like this please flag away, you never know.
Grand Concourse Restaurant=Holy Brunch Buffet Batman!There's a difference between a place that has one long table of buffet choices that's mass produced and more than likely been sitting out for most of the morning and the Grand Concourse.  The Grand Concourse is just that, GRAND!The Grand Concourse may have that one long table of buffet foods that have possibly been touched by little kid sticky hands BUT they have "create your own" food stands!  Any place that offers me the chance to pile on the most scrumptious and fattening food toppings is a winner in my book!  Stop by the make your own omelet or pancake or waffle or ICE CREAM SUNDAE (can you tell how excited I am about that) bar for your own sinful creation.  And the place itself....just breathtaking!  You don't come across many places like this anymore.  It used to be the main train station into downtown Pittsburgh and they've really done a fantastic job making it look as it did back in the day.  I swear to god I always want to act out the scene in the Titanic where they're all sitting around the main dining room together talking all proper.  But then I remember I'm shoveling 30 pounds worth of pancakes in my mouth and that vision quickly dissolves!*Remember if you want to go for brunch make a reservation!  Bon voyage on your eating adventure!I had fun, it's a beautiful place.  The service was really good and I love buffet dining.  Here's the thing.  The food ranged from bad to just ok.  I am there for the food.  There are a couple reviews about this restaurant that exclaim that it's the best buffet ever.  I should have really ignored them and focused on all the more critical reviews on this restaurant as they really rang true.  Normally when the reviews are this mixed I stay far away.  I don't know where to begin.  How about the omelet station.  It takes a tremendous amount of skill to make a good omelet on a flat top.  It just isn't done this way.  You have to spread out a lot of egg and quickly fold it onto itself to give it any depth.  If you leave it flat, it's done before you can warm any ingredients or melt any cheese.  I watched rubbery brown thin wrappers of egg surround cold and bland ingredients flow from a well meaning omelet station attendant.  How could you? I didn't realize it until later but if you're looking for the french toast, it's hidden in back of the omelet station in a hotel pan.  I never did find it until we were on our way out the door.  The best 2 things about this brunch were the automatic donut machine and the bagels.  Neither of which this place makes on their own.  In fact, I noted quite a few things they don't actually prepare here at all.  The meat carving station looked nice and I chose the Gobi Dessert of pork loins.  It isn't 1950 and you don't have to cook pork within an inch of it's life anymore.  There wasn't anyone in the kitchen today that knows how lean a cut this is and how if you're going to put it out on a carving station it should be cooked til slightly pink in the center. The desert station isn't worth my time to talk about.  There isn't a real pastry chef there and the cookies were clearly out of a box.  The chocolate cake tasted like Duncan Hines with the frosting that you get out of a can.  Another sad and depressing effort here in the Burgh.  Sigh.
Toscana=I worked with a chef, calamari was his favorite cuss word, he would be dead serious and yelling in his Italian accent, "ohh calamari!""Oh, calamari!" was what I wanted to yell when I ate at Toscana, it is a true Italian restaurant, not a wanna be, down to the tall, dark, European waiters.  This restaurant is a hidden little gem in the Specialty Shops at the Park (gag, what a lame name for shops.)  I ordered linguini with shrimp, calamari, clams, mussels & cherry tomatoes.  Pretty tasty and for $13, not a bad deal for a pasta dish enough for two and loaded with seafood.My lunch partner in crime had rigatoni with sausage & peas in a tomato cream sauce. You can't go wrong with anything with heavy cream added!They have a small express lunch menu for $13, including soup or salad, lunch special and a tea/soda. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon.
Amlee Chinese Cuisine=Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared "family style" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.I finally found a place to get great Chinese food. I noticed some other reviews mentioned this place being too pricey. I don't get that it does say gourmet on the sign out front. Sure the inside is completely dated but it still has class and the owner herself comes to the table to serve each plate. She even prepared the salad we ordered fresh in front of us. The food isn't greasy in anyway which id w hat I find at most places I have been too. The portion of food you get for the price is very good. I would suggest because if the portion sizes that you either plan on sharing with your table or taking leftovers home. Nothing like cold Chinese food for lunch the next day! I ordered Szechuan Beef and could have easily eaten the whole dish if I weren't sharing with others because it was that good. The meat was tender and very good. I rarely eat rabbit food but I did think it was cool how it was prepared right in front of us. The vegetable fried rice tasted perfect. My wife thought it could use more flavor but she also likes soy sauce on it so whatever. The service is really awesome here and i left full and satisfied. Coming back for sure. Call ahead and order take out if you don't want to dine inside.3.5 STARS: Good  Money talks. When I  spend money I talk about it on Yelp. In the next few paragraphs I will talk about my lunch in Amlee Chinese Cuisine.  In recent times I have been trying out the different Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. After visiting Amy's Hallmark, I decided to try Amlee Chinese Cuisine near my house.  Amlee Chinese Cuisine is located in a small strip mall at the southeast corner of Sunset and Sandhill Roads. From what I read, Amlee Chinese Cuisine has been standing in this exact spot for thirty years. It has been thirty years of family ownership. When a restaurant is in business for thirty years, they rise above it all. In 2003, Amlee Chinese Cuisine rised above it all when the Best of Las Vegas voted it the best Chinese Restaurant in 2003 (www.usmenuguide.com/amleegourmet.htm).   When I walked inside Amlee Chinese Cuisine at lunchtime, I saw a bar to my right and a spacious dining room to the left. The tables were large and nearly empty at this visit.   The personable waitress led me to a table in this comfortable dining room. Soon, she poured the water into a clean glass. Nonetheless I ordered a Coke with my lunch. This is the first Chinese Restaurant that has ever served me Coke from Mexico. So, it was a cosmopolitan lunch with Mexican Coke and Chinese food.   The luncheon special attracted me to Amlee Chinese Cuisine. As my fellow Yelpers have stated, the prices here are higher. I can't support the argument that you get what you pay for when I had food of equivalent taste and quality for the same price recently at dinner in China Bistro, NY Chinese Restaurant, and China Tango Bistro. The lunch specials range between $7.95 and $10.95. They include an entre, soup of the day that is expectedly the omnipresent egg drop soup, egg roll, and choice of fried or white rice. For $1.50 extra, they will substitute the soup of the day with wonton soup. With a Coke from Mexico, wonton soup, and tip my lunch special added up to around $17.50.  I ordered the shrimp chow mein. The personable waitress stated that this is one of her favorites. In my opinion, the wonton soup was my favorite. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and not get tired of it. Maybe that's because wonton soup is in my Top 25 Favorite Foods List. The fried rice was a lighter color than I was used to. However, it was delicious. The noodle based shrimp chow mein was also delicious. I appreciated all the vegetables that tasted like onion and cabage mixed in. On the other hand I would of appreciated more than four shrimp. Come to think of it, I would of appreciated it if the meal included crunchy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard.   I have done enough talking about Amlee Chinese Cuisine. In my opinion that is based on experiences dining in Chinese Restaurants, Amlee is a good Chinese Restaurant that I anticipate serving the Las Vegas community in the decades ahead.
Lai Lai Express=This is a little tiny hole in the wall to-go cheap Chinese place but they have enough space for a few dine-in tables.  Is it anything fancy?? NO.  But it sure is cheap and solid.  Where else can you find a lunch special for $4.50 with rice and egg roll (I personally like spring roll better)?  The portion isn't big, so I feel bad for eating the whole darn order in record time since I normally split my food into 2 meals to justify all the craps I eat.  But a girl gotta do what a girl gotta do to fill her belly.  Just FYI, when I eat with my parents here, we actually order a little more authetic Chinese... like Ma Po Tofu and salt & pepper spare ribs, and they are actually really good.  If you don't speak Chinese (assuming that you don't), I wonder if you can still ask for it.
Gus's SIR Beef Restaurant=It breaks my little heart to rate Gus's Sir Beef two stars - especially since the staff are very sweet and down to earth. But alas, my meal and overall impression of the place was sub par at best.The place: It's an establishment. Gus's has been around for some time and it shows. It's an old school Southern diner esque, classic meat & three, etc. And that's completely fine by me, but the building is showing some major wear and the menus are a bit crusty and food laden. You only get one chance to make a first impression...The staff: As mentioned, everyone here is kind and sweet. The kind of place where the server calls you "hun" and probably has for 30 years. The food: Just not bueno for me. On Gus's menu, he purports that he uses only farm fresh veggies from his actual farm. Well, it didn't look like it in my "crisp" salad. My bowl of greens looked, and tasted, straight out of a mixed greens bag. And the lettuce was swimming in cool water with a touch of dressing. For my main lunch course I chose the cheese ravioli which came out crusted and baked with oodles of plastic-y cheese. The sauce tasted canned and the ravioli were essentially tasteless. Needless to say, I left Gus's Sir Beef hungry and disappointed. I really wanted to like this classic lunch spot, but it fell very short of a winner for me.
Greg's Bar B Q=Let me start off by saying they failed my french fry barometer test. Very sad. You know this makes me mad, good thing I'm not the Incredible Hulk or  I would be flippin' tables and takin' names.I was with my parents so we pigged out (pun, not intended) . Everything was lukewarm,  fried squash, broccoli casserole, french fries, baked beans and my bbq sandwich. It was fine and our server was very charming.  Sweet tea was average.  I wouldn't write it off, but I would't make a special trip to return.
Courier Cafe=I would have given Courier Cafe five stars after having had a wonderful lunch last week and having had a delightful milkshake there this evening, if not for a horrifying experience today.I came with three other new history grad students.  And we were delighted, ever so delighted with the milkshakes.  They were creamy and wonderful, and, thinking of how much I enjoyed my lunch (pesto chicken pita) last week, I knew I'd have a great night.  We joked and laughed, and we found ourselves finally feeling at ease in our new Midwestern home.Until the owner/manager, a cranky older man walked up and said, "You need to keep down.  People are complaining about your noise all throughout the restaurant."Um, WTF?  We had laughed loudly, yes, but it was 9pm in a college town.  It wasn't that horrible.  We weren't saying anything inappropriate, and it wasn't overblown.  We were given our checks--basically thrown at us--very quickly, and we were basically 'encouraged' to leave.This ruined our awesome experience.  And it sucked.  And we were made to feel like crap for the last few minutes since we were there.  Then Jerky McAss then glared at us while we paid our bills.Thanks for treating us like crap, jerk.  We really liked this place, but I guess it's not something I'm looking forward to visiting now.We have been coming into the Courier Cafe for years,  and despite the very tasty "home-cooked" feel the meals at Courier Cafe have,  service has steadily deteriorated. It has never been so bad. The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food.-(Money-saving Mystery Butter blend) On numerous occasions when we dined here, we had a very hard time getting an order in. When ordering a plate, the waitress was cold and stern. We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving "mystery butter blend", and she was making a face and saying "Oh I'm not sure I can do that", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.-(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!-(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said "hi", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her "you have customers waiting for you, Nicole."But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile. -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a "Liar" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us "Disingenuous" for the same reason.-(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again.I'd pass if I were you.This 4-star bullshit is a reflection of Urbana's high tolerance for mediocrity.The sandwiches look like something a kindergartener would get at a daycare center with a side of fruit cocktail. Wonderbread with an anorexic serving of meat and a pickle spear for $8 or more.We had to get up and walk around to find an employee who would take our money. The couple next to us got up and left because nobody would take their order.Inexcusably bad service, inexplicably bad food. Come on, Urbana, for once, accept the fact that some businesses are meant to die. In case you don't get out much, the Courier Cafe is terrible. They are operating as if they have no competition.Suffering through a shit sandwich and bad service is a stupid way of supporting local business. Unless you're into self-punishment and leather and... you know, in that case, join the priesthood.On a sidestreet in downtown Urbanaa hidden gem sits, tucked awayBy word of mouth, all locals knowabout Courier CafeThe moment you walk through the dooryou're filled with small-town cheerThe atmosphere is "mom & pops"No wonder they've been here for yearsGigantic cookies as big as your headpastries and muffins are on displayNext to their vintage cash registerBeneath the glass counter where you payTheir menu is full of sundaes and shakesordered by children & adults alikeThey've got burgers, sandwiches and wrapsI haven't found something I didn't likeBy the way, for just 95 centsyou can pick a side with your mealSeasoned wedge fries or sweet potato chipsBut the dill potato salad's my idealIf you come, do so for brunchOr breakfast, lunch or dinnerAt any time of the day, just be preparedThat you won't leave here feeling thinnerWhich leads me to a related topicTheir hot fudge will make you swoon!"Would you like some ice cream with that fudge?"Nah, the fudge itself- plus me and a spoon.As a student, I had a morning ritual:Fresh coffee and a pastry.The croissant-crust with raspberry preservesMan, it's been years since I've had one lately...So, five stars are for nostalgiaand five stars are for the foodHopefully proof enough, that this place is the bomb:Using poetry to capture the moodThis place has made its markIt's a beloved Urbana spot of mineEvery time I come back to campusThis is hands-down where I'll dine
Dino's Family Restaurant=Easy breakfast in a quiet family-style restaurant just off North Tryon, I was at a table and placing my order in seconds. Cheese omelet, hash browns and wheat toast with coffee. My waitress was quick, efficient and got the job done.Breakfast was exactly as ordered needing only a few blobs of the Texas Pete that was already on the table. Perfect.$10 with tip, hard to go wrong!
Himal Chuli=Adore!The prices are enough to make me head over heals for the place. Add to this unique flavors not found anywhere else on State, I'm a fan. Typical these days is the dal/roti/takari... the sweet potato being my fave. And while service can be slow and it's cash only, knowing that going in makes it a wee more tolerable.
Showmars=I must profess my love for Showmars. There aren't many businesses that deserve 5 stars, but Showmars is on point. Everything is good. Customer service, all of the food and without a doubt, the undisputed star of the show - the Fish Sandwich. I've ordered it over 2 dozen times and each bite is as still as good as the first. The English language and Roman Alphabet alone cannot describe the satisfaction and pure bliss that it brings me. I wish you all could hear me and see my facial expressions. That fish sandwich my friends, with tartar and coleslaw really is the world's greatest.
Jolly Bob's=I'm a Madison native and have been to Jolly Bob's a few times. It's not a terrible place, but tonight as I was walking in I saw a long dress code. I thought it was a joke at first, because in addition to "no doo-rag", they said that no white shirts were allowed. I thought they couldn't be serious.That is, until I got turned away at the door. I'm a white guy, but I can recognize that policies like this are clearly racist. They're trying to keep out 'ghetto' guys and have ended up with a laughable dress code. I honestly felt like I was in the '50s and segregation was in full force - it was just a bizarre, sad experience, especially after living in Brazil for 3 years.Add to this the fact that as I stood there at the door trying to get my sister's attention, I saw a woman in a white shirt and pointed her out to the bouncer. "The code is only for men" he said. O.....K..... that makes a lot of sense.This is a racist policy that people shouldn't support. I'm definitely not going in there again - no matter what I'm wearing.
Wong's Restaurant=After eating at Wong's, you'll  hate yourself for having ever had Panda Express.The first thing you notice about Wong's is how misleading the outside is. It's wedged between a used book store and a bridal store and looks about as big as a taco truck. You get inside, however, and a large, superbly decorated dining room awaits you. I have never, in all the years I've gone to Wong's, waited for a table. Literally, I'm seated half a minute within entering. Even during the lunch rush, there's always room. Tea is provided, and between that and the water, you probably won't want to order a coke or anything. The tea takes some getting used to, but soon you won't be able to eat lo mein without it. And expect to get your water glass refilled like at least a dozen times. Literally, I've never actually finished a glass of water before it was refilled. The staff is so accommodating and hospitable, it's like eating in a family's dining room table. The service is so on par that out of the years I've been going, only one guy has ever complained about his food. Have you ever seen other patrons at a restaurant tell a complaining customer to STFU? Well, that's how awesome Wong's is. No joke.The food is, like, whoa. Personally I prefer the lunch specials, where you get the entree, fried rice, egg roll and soup for about the cost of a McMeal Deal. Dinner comes with a big pot of rice that you and your friends will never finish so don't even try.Foods I Recommend: Pork Lo Mein, Emperor's Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, and Chow Mein.The menu they offer is also super easy to understand, with clear cut descriptions of all the entrees, which is nice, because nothing irritates me more than a Chinese eatery that serves you soft noodles and calls it "chow mein".-The owner (man) was VERY friendly.-Some Chinese Woman (the owner's wife?)...NOT friendly! She gave me the impression that I was bothering her for coming in to eat there! There were like 3 or 4 other tables in the whole place.-The Food: Not so great...the chicken was mostly small almost chopped chicken chunks...dry too, maybe from overcooking?-Flavor: Ick! I didn't care for the food, thought it was bland.-Beef dish, not much beef...mostly veggies vs the meat ratio...$8.95. Not a good value.-I said "thank-you", as I left...the Chinese Woman looked at me and said nothing, then she walked away....nice!-Parking is convenient.-With the un-friendly Chinese Woman and not so great food, there are many other Chinese restaurants that I would select over Wongs.
Roadrunner Saloon=I love love love Roadrunner Saloon!  Here's why:1. I love bar food, cowboy food, and Tex-Mex food.  Roadrunner Saloon carries all three of these types of food and they all taste great! I have tried a lot of the items and my belly is always happy afterwards.  Tasty food makes me happy.2. Dr. Pepper Tacos!  Yes, you heard me right!  I love Dr. Pepper just a smidgeon less than my hubby and kid, like a paper thin difference.  So when I heard about these tacos, I had to investigate.  They are super duper fantastic!  The soda makes the meat so tender and flavorful.   They are fun to eat and taste great. I know this goes with #1, but anything regarding Dr. Pepper gets a special spot in my book.3. Great service.  Every time I have been to this location, I have gotten great service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  I love good service because it makes your meal so much more enjoyable.  4. It's family friendly.  Many of my favorite bar food joints have switched to a 21 and over only, which means I rarely can go.  Sad.  Roadrunner does allow kids and families, so we can all go out to a good meal.  My daughter loves the place too because she is all about cowboy stuff already.5. The drinks are stiff!  If you are interested in bar service, the drinks are tasty.  I rarely have alcoholic drinks these days, but if you want one, Roadrunner serves stiff!The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that I think the prices are a bit high for what you get.  It isn't crazy over priced, just a $1 or so too high on most of the food items and $2-3 to high on the drinks.  Maybe I am just cheap in my old age, but that is how I see it.  I still love this place and will continue to go, I just wish it was a bit cheaper.
Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches=For 2 years I've been driving by @jimmyjohns. Today I stopped in.I am always hesitant of any place that has "Gourmet" in the name, that usually just means OVERPRICED.Right away you are greeted by everyone ready to take your order. Immediately you will notice a small menu board of ONLY cold lunchmeat sandwiches-no phillys,pizzas,etc.I ordered a #14-Roast beef & turkey on wheat. $7Don't get me wrong it was all fresh and a tasty lunchmeat sandwich but nothing to write home about. I'll keep driving by in the future.ps they DELIVER
Big Dog's Draft House=If you are into beer, and I don't mean the fizzy yellow stuff, then you have to visit the Draft House!  Big dogs brews some of the best beer I've ever had.  It easily compares to Stone, Pizzaport, and is better than Dogfish Head.  Two particular beers that they brew, Alpha Dog (a double red ale, 8% abv), and War Dog (IPA, 8% abv) are just incredible beers!  Try the bullocks IPA, or the Dirty Dog IPA if those are not available.  The food is standard bar food, but with a higher quality than most bars in Las Vegas.  The Cheese Kurds are so awesome, and all of the sandwiches are really good too.  The fries are great, and the service is always top notch.  I am a big fan of Draft House, and a big fan of their beer.  Check out Beer School, and their other events with live music and special guest brews like Pizzaport and Stone.This is my "neighborhood bar"- the one I frequent when all else fails. Came mostly to try the seasonal War Dog IPA (hoppy meaness yet smooth= luvs!)I got one of their creations which you can make into a chicken sandwich, portobello mushroom sandwich, or burger (beef or boca). Grabbed The Roma Pesto (Delicious combination of homemade pesto, oven roasted tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon, and melted Mozzarella and Fontina cheese) with chicken and it was seriously good. Chicken was so juicy and definitely the best bar chicken sandwich I've had. Food has been bomb here and I'm not a American bar food kind of person either.Only miss was the pub cheese platter and that was one that was just "alright"...the cheese wasn't quite melted all the way. Everything else though has been fantastic.Next party I definitely want a grab a growler. Just for those not in the know- you buy this moonshine like jug and they'll fill it up with beer to take home! You can bring the jug back to refill it.Heard from @Dan P that they just tapped a batch of War Dog last Thursday....so I made sure I stopped by for lunch as soon as I came back to Vegas on Sunday.  Brought Mom's with me for our traditional Sunday lunch....we were staving and couldn't wait to get seated.  The Draft House is a Green Bay Packers Bar.....so it was packed with Packer Fans on the bar side....not one available seat or table.  It was 3 pm and the Packers vs Vikings game wasn't for another 2 hrs, but it was packed to the hilt!  We got seated in the dining room area, our server wes named Apple, seriously.After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we asked Apple if there were any specials....she proceeded to tell us about a bunch of Appetizer Specials ($2 off) and $2 off for the War Dog during the NFL Games, so we took her up on it.  We ordered:- 1/2 Order of Nachos $7.50- Bratwurst $3.50- Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels $5- NFL Hot Wings (10 Wings) w/Chipotle Sauce....their hottest Wing Sauce $6To wash it down, we both ordered Water and I of course ordered a 24 oz War Dog!  ($7.50, $5.50 with the special) The War Dog was freakin' awesome.....not as Hoppy as I expected based on @Dan P's report, but it was very good.After a short wait, we got our food....Nachos first.  Mom and I attacked those Nachos.  They were pretty good....topped with Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole, Olives, Jalapenos, Salsa, and Onions.Next up was the NFL Wings.....I jumped on those next....damn, they were awesome!  Very Meaty Wings.....the Chipotle Sauce was just right....had that Smoky flavor and was just Spicy enough for me and Mom.  The Ranch given to us for dipping went well with the Wings.They brought out my Bratwurst next.....I added some Mustard and Relish and went to town on it.  It came with grilled Onions topped on the Bratwurst.  It was pretty good....although the Bun wasn't all that.  I would have preferred a Roll or Italian Bread instead of a Hot Dog Bun.The last item to come out was the Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels.....they were piping hot and moist and doughy.....delish!  They came with a side of Nacho Cheese for dipping.It was at this point that Mom and I figured out that we ordered too much food.  I wasn't going to let this place defeat me though, so I pressed on.  Mom said she'd finish the Nachos and I would handle whatever was left of the Wings & Pretzels.We took our time watching the Seahawks vs Cardinals game and finished our food and Beer.When Apple delivered our check she said she made a mistake and gave us the food specials for Monday Night Football, not Sunday....but that the restaurant was going to honor the specials anyway because of the mistake....is that great service or what?Overall, great food & great service.Will I return?  You bet!We are here at least once a week. Today they made a mistake with my order. I wanted a portobello mushroom "burger" with cajun spice, blue cheese, red pepper. I got a boca burger. They were really cool about asking if I want a refire, but I was hungry and I don't mind Boca burgers, just I find most kitchens just kinda treat it like it needs to be heated and not "cooked"/seasoned like any other burger. The usual bartender even walked over and told me to take a bite and if it isn't what I want to get something else because "my happiness is important". He's always really cool and I do believe here that they sincerely mean it. Their mistake ended up being a good thing. The boca had cajun spice on it and was charred to crispy outside which was actually pretty nice. I ate all of it. Thought to talk about it so that in case there's some vegetarians out there- their portobello and boca burger options are good. I haven't talked about the sweet potato waffle fries yet....these are amazing- very light and crispy. They come with a beer mustard sauce that is lovely. Upgrade your regular side for the sweet potato, or get this as an app since it's great nosh with beer.Just a FYI theres a Winterfest 1-29-2011...sounds like a UYE. "25+ Beers.  Cajun Gumbo & Oyster Shooters.  3 Bands.  Raffles & More. 2-8 pm and After Party: 9 pm - ??"Yay! I'm a fan of Big Dog's...only if I'm in the area.At Big Dog's, the portions are just that, pretty big.  Service is always quick to be seated, order to be taken, and food to arrive. Can't give them 5 stars for service because at Big Dog's, they are not the most attentive group.  Once you get your meal, there are times you don't see or hear from a server until your check is given to you.  My suggestion is to do what I always do, order your drink refill early. As for the food, it's not bad and the portions are good.-Sliders: This was recommended on my very first visit about two years ago.  Priced about average (less than $10)' It's still delicious and taste about the same as other pub and grill joints.-Fish and Chips:  Deep fried and greasy.  Poke a couple of holes in the breaded fish and drain the greasy out first.  Now you're takin'.  Now it's at least edible.  I think the batter is a little too thick and takes away from the taste of the fish.-Steak:  Not a bad option, but it's a little dry.  However, it's cheap and you get what you pay for.-Pizza:  Has to be over 2 years since my last pizza here, but it's cheap and one of their better prepared items here.  For less than $10, a personal pizza here is tasty and not too greasy.-Burgers:  2nd favorite to their pizza.  Their burgers are stacked, juicy, and affordable. I never expect much at Big Dog's because the prices are cheap and it's basically pub food.  Portions are big and there's still enough on the menu for everybody.It's back at last!  After a long layoff, the best stroganoff in town has returned to the menu in the form of Old Fashioned Beef Stroganoff.  Featuring Choice-grade tender morsels of Top Sirloin beef, Crimini Mushrooms, and Pearl Onions combined with oodles of Egg Noodles and mixed together with burgundy in a piping hot Garlic Sour Cream Sauce, this is one delicious entree.  Precede this marvelous main with an order of Potstickers dunked in a spicy Asian dipping sauce and a Draft House Side Salad with a memorable light Honey Mustard Dressing, and a diner will have experienced one fine meal.Service here, too, was again fine and amiable, enjoying classic comfort food in a comfortable environment.  The only down note was the restaurant already being out of Cajun Seafood & Sausage Cajun Chowder by 9:30 p.m. when Diane and I arrived.4-1/2 stars overall!Potstickers are securely back on the menu.  So is Beef Stroganoff.  Now, if Big Dog's management is truly listening to customer demand, in order to create real comfort food nirvana it is time to also herald the daily return of the magnificent French Onion Soup previously served at the now shuttered Sahara Avenue Big Dog Cafe's location and since then offered only occasionally here as the soup of the day.Since my last re-review, I have been back to Big Dog's several times, and the level of consistency in food preparation and service are what keeps me coming back for more  late dinners there.  The last two times, after scarfing down pan-fried Pot Stickers dipped in a Szechuan Sauce that I just cannot order a meal there without having as a starter, followed by the always excellent and scorching Cajun Sausage & Seafood Chowder when it is served, I ventured off familiar ground and tried a few different dishes.  A Holy Cow! Reuben on toasted Rye, featuring lean and moist corned beef, melted cheese, and Sauerkraut, and aided and abetted by White Onions and French's Yellow Mustard, tasted great.  I will no doubt order this delicious sandwich again.  Crunchy French Fries were a lovely accompaniment.  And, after the Pot Stickers were originally forgotten by the chef, the manager wrote the appetizer off the bill.  On another occasion I enjoyed for my entree moist Pecan-Crusted Walleye Pike flown in from Wisconsin, while Diane enjoyed her usual Fried Shrimp &n Fries appetizer.  This time 4-1/2 stars were earned.
El Portal Restaurant=Co-worker: We're going to El Portal for lunch.Me: Que es el portal?Co-worker: Oh right. I always forget your not from here.So the review from Pierre is totally on-point. I went to El Portal with my co-workers who are all very involved in the state politics/worker scene. And sure enough while we were there a ton of staffers, court officials, reporters, etc would walk in and out. I don't know if I'd qualify it as a celebrity spot. And likely most wouldn't return if it was. But definitely is a really good spot tucked back just south of downtown. I had the chicken tostados which were fantastic. The service is lacking at best. But I was there around 12:30 and it was really packed. The servers were super nice...just too busy to be really attentive. There's also a huge painting of MLK and an enlarged Cesar Chavez stamp on the walls. I don't know that they have a stealth interior design person...but hey, who doesn't love a little awkwardly placed (but obviously beloved) Cesar and MLK!?
Peppi's=If the old city mainstay littered with sandwiches-of-old, walls festooned with photos of celebrities with the owner, and the SAME things they have been doing since they opened ever go out of style, then I'll quit at life. Peppi's isn't just a spot for lunch. It's a storybook opened to the meat of the climax of one incredible story. To say they have "history" would be a disservice. These guys wrote the book from what I can glean from the pictures sports memorabilia. I had the pleasure of visiting while in Pittsburgh this summer and was thrilled with the product and especially the service. I had a group of kids with me, so I made sure they didn't have to do too much talking for these fast-paced guys. We ordered a bunch of fries, drinks, and a mixtures of mains. Some of the kiddos decided to go for comforts (i.e. chicken fingers. Lame) but a few of us went for some menu titans. Namely, The Big Wheeler. Holy cow. Quite literally. Steak and sausage with provolone. Pretty unreal. It was a massive sandwich, too. All of the flavors melded together were like the Blues ancients, all of the Steelers and Pirates players, and all of the Ohio riverboat captains together were giving me high-fives. It just felt right. Meaty, greasy, melty, packed with flavor, and delightfully heavy. I felt like more of a complete human after having this sandwich. Though we were all famished from the seemingly manual labor we were doing, I could only make it through half of it in one sitting. Also, the owner and all of the folks on the line were incredibly nice. They had grace with our group and made us feel incredibly welcome. Pro Tip: Make sure you have cash for this location. They have an ATM in-house, but it'll speed things up if you have your own when you walk in. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, Peppi's will be a definite visit. Rock on.
Nadine's=Let me just state for some that I did not come here because of DDD and no, I did not try what was featured on the show.  I came here...well, simply because I was hungry and thirsty.Upon walking in this place makes you feel like you are in the wrong place, that is until you are warmly greeted by the bartender.  We didn't even have our coats off and were asked if we wanted something to drink.  We quickly settled on a draft and were brought menus.  Now, people, this place has a very small menu.  On top of the small menu there are specials that appear to change often.  A note to people also is that this place specializes in breakfast, half of the menu is for breakfast fare.  I almost ordered a special but decided to go with something from the menu.  I got the BLT and a side of fries; my friend got a cheese quesadilla and onion rings.This is the nice part, everything is cooked fresh when you order it!  My BLT was amazing.  The bacon was crispy, tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, and the bread was just toasted.  The fries are fresh cut.  So no frozen here, cut and then thrown in to fry.  With the light touch of mayo on the sandwich it surely hit the spot.  The quesadilla and onion rings looked good too, but I kept my mind on my own plate.This place, even though it is nothing more than a hole in the wall that has been there for "17 years" (I believe that's what the sign says outside) is amazing and charming.  It's small in here, so if you have a big party, don't expect to feel comfortable in here.  It's dark from the walls and small windows, which to me made it feel warm.  The decor is about as typical as you can expect with many places like this.  I totally liked that their dishes were mixed and matched.  Like they went to Goodwill next door and just bought every plate they had on the shelf.  It gives this place the "we don't go with the flow" feel that makes it work.After a satisfying meal the check arrived.  That was like the cherry on the cake, for two meals and two drafts, $15.  I kid you not.  Totally worth checking this place out for food and not just drink.We love coming here to eat. We literally live around the block so I pass by it often and I have to stop the temptation to eat out. I've had many things from here-- mixed grill breakfast, meatloaf, country fried steak.. all winners in my book. They also have great drink prices and a very friendly staff who are all hard workers. They play bartender, food server, cook and a person to vent to. When bobby has a week day off of work, he will wake up and come here for breakfast. He'll then meet me for my lunch hour downtown and say "i'm not hungry.. i stopped at Nadine's" I've heard that line atleast 5 times in the last 6 months
Church's Chicken=Well, I decided to start the year off right. And go to Church. I have to admit I hadn't been to Church in quite awhile. Such a sin. I know. I didn't get all dressed up but I did do the sign of the cross when I entered Church's. Oh. I meant to say Church's earlier in the review. Not church. My bad. How silly. What a silly yelper am I? Church's. You know. Double battered fried chicken. Deep fried okra. Powderd mashed potatoes. And the mac n cheese. Why the latter is indeed heavenly. And a sin at the same time. I'm not gonna compare the grease sticks here to the grease sticks at KFC or Popeye's. All kinda the same to me. But I can tell you the offering from Church's soaked up the booze from ringing out 07 the night before. Grease be with you. And also with you.
Buck's Pizza=Pizza's like sex even if its not great,  its still ok. Should have read reviews. Weird thin crust,  the sauce was ehhhh n didn't care for cheese. I hate giving low reviews but this pizza just didnt cut it.
Los Compadres=Bland, boring, "Mexican-esque" food. Warning sign #1: all white people dining there.Warning sign #2: salsa that's bland as ketchupWarning sign #3: no hot sauces on the tableThe three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials. Yet our plates looked almost indistinguishable from one another. On each was some configuration of flour tortillas, mountains of shredded iceberg lettuce, and a slick of pale refried beans, all topped with  orange cheese.You can get more flavorful "Mexican" food at Del taco. This place is more like Mexican't food. Ulgh. I want my $5.25 back.
Sorrento's Pizza=I don't care what anyone says.  I love Sorrento's pizza.  My dad used to bring me here as a kid when he worked across the street.  As an adult, I figured I would be really disappointed, but it was just as good as I remember the pizza.Coming in for the first time at dinner time, my friends and I ordered an extra large pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese for $10.  The pizza is super greasy and will literally melt the paper plate away.  It arrives at your table fresh out of the oven and loaded with cheese and toppings.  Everything about this pizza is fantastic.  I pulled down four slices at dinner and three slices during the night.  I love this cheap pizza.  It's not authentic Italian, but it is so good nonetheless.The employees are super nice and casual, and the police were here eating dinner when we were.  That is always a good sign in my book.  My friends and I have started coming in regularly after our night classes end at 9 PM because we start craving their pizza in the middle of class.Super cheap and fast!
Tea Station=6 years ago, we did the American FOB thang and flew to Las Vegas to see the Taiwanese and Hong Kong R&B sensation version of J-Lo at the shitty Mandalay Bay Events Center (at ticket prices that would make U2, The Cure, and Radiohead blush), I suppose you can call her C-Lee, or stage name Coco Lee (real name ahem....Ferren Lee, gotta love Hong Kongers who try to get too creative with English names). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Lee(the pic in the link is old btw, you can probably find some more recent material on youtube if you want an idea).Coco is 100% Chinese, speaks fluent English having spent much time in the US since age 10 (attended UC Irvine at some point) yet somehow through vocal training can belt out (in her prime which has sadly past) a voice that almost sounds like Mo Town, and somehow managed to develop some serious badonkadonk that looked like it came straight outta Puerto Rico. So we sat down for the whole show, and Coco had to work on the crowd, most of whom were older A$Ns and younger AZNs who came from more conservative families and didn't seem to have a clue as to how to behave at pop concerts, and needed cues from the pop $en$ation herself that she needed more encouragement from the audience via louder screams, or some AZN announcer trying to work the crowd again at the end of the first set for an encore (when the reverse is true at western rock concerts, the audience automatically goes buck wild for encores without cues). At some point we were a bit worn out and jaded at this pseudo imported A$N pop concert experience and how lame it turned out to be (where half of the songs had no live band backing, and one song was lip sync'd to the studio album playing in the background, sorry Coco ain't Janet Jackson who in her prime sang AND danced) and immediately thought about where we could unwind from the madness (or lack thereof).So Tea Planet came into play. We knew about this place as TP (not toilet paper) is actually Tsing Shong Xiao Dzan, aka Tea Station Cafe. It is also owned by the same group or family who operates a chain of them across Southern California (and two locations in Nor Cal, Fremont and Newark) with them mainly stationed by the location by San Gabriel Square on Valley. (SGV).We had no set of wheels of our own, so we cabbed it here within less than 10 minutes. Don't remember too much about this place, except the menu mirrors the Tea Stations in Southern California, but not quite the same quality and vibe. My iced mixed fruit tea was overly sweetened (was my favorite drink at the Southern Cal TS). I suppose this location is better than the one in Nor Cal Newark, decent and passable and for sure way better than Quickbux or some other tapioca tea joint. Then again I'm a bit biased as I'm a fan of Ten Ren, straight outta Taiwan.In the words of a friend, TAIWAN ROCs! (Republic of China lolz).And Coco's a$$ got really big when we saw her again at the Shoreline in Mountain View CA  September 07 (actually we were there for opener Alex To, former druggie who at 40 going towards 50, still kicked a shitload of ass, like a stripper working overtime for that dollar). F******K still the same schtick from her about "I'm so nervous I need some encouragement", "are y'all cuh-rayzee AZN muckafuthas ready to par-tay? Lemme hear ya scuh-reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem b*tches!"At least Tea Planet and Ten Ren are much less predictable than a Co Co show. $ave your money and get some OG Tea $tation sippage.My friend and I were on a mission for boba... at 2am, so this was the only place that was open. One that would satisfy our craving, I mean.I had the milk green tea with boba, and it was perfect.  The only thing not so perfect was the increasing prices! I came here about a month or two ago, and the large teas were 4.75, which is now the price of the regular teas! The large is 6 whopping buckaroos!! 6 bucks for a large milk tea?! AND I payed for it!! Can someone please tell me what went wrong in that situation?!! Wahhh!!!On a better note, if you order your boba to-go, I believe you get 15 percent off your purchase?*NOTE: if you like paying for expensive and tasty boba, please remember to ask for a stamp card. Haha, thank you.Since moving to Vegas I have now discovered that Tea Station is indeed the best place for boba in the Las Vegas area. I'm not sure if my taste buds have adapted or if Tea Station has gotten better in the last few years. Either way they are the most authentic I've had in the area and I've been a boba master since the age of 11. Their prices are still a little high and a regular sized pearl milk tea will run close to $4.Haven't encountered the bad service issues that others complain about, but they do lose a star for their their $10 card minimum- and this whole damn plaza is like that.The coconut milk tea and coffee milk tea are both good here, and the boba is great: soft, good chewiness, good quantity. Millions of tea-flavored foods are here as well, the tea-flavored eggs and eel sound amazing but so far I haven't been brave enough to try them.Really ticked off about the $10 minimum- if food trucks can use Square without having a minimum, a brick and mortar building has no excuse. I drive by frequently and opt to go elsewhere because I rarely carry cash and won't order that much if I'm solo.Call me spoiled but I'm used to the land of boba and milk tea, Los Angeles. I guess that makes me a boba snob? Is that even a thing? I guess it can be. I'm still trying to find a good place for boba, teas and snacks in Vegas and my quest has come up with nothing so far. I tried Tea Station out one afternoon after having lunch with some friends in Chinatown. I've been to the ones in SoCal before and expected it to be pretty much the same thing. I guess it was okay. I had a green milk tea with grass jelly regular size and it came out to about $5.. It was a little pricey and the grass jelly was just alright.However, this place has a HUGE menu and selection of teas, milk teas, smoothies, etc and a food menu as well! I think if I were to come back, I want to try their popcorn chicken (Chinese popcorn chicken, mind you) which I have been craving!Tea Station is in the same plaza as Ichiza and parking can be a toughie sometimes since there are a very limited number of spots in the plaza so may the parking deities be with you on your quest as well!3.5 stars for Tea Station!I first came to this Tea Station on a Vegas outing with the boys.  One of them had a crush on a worker here and we were all forced to join in on the ride.  Seeing that there's a minimum for card purchases, we were all advised to bring cash.  Not a bad little tip!  While I find their prices to be a bit high for bubble tea, they mike a delicious Rose Milk Green Tea and a Royal Milk Tea.  There's no way around it.  It's the perfect amount of sweetness and flavoring.  I haven't tried much of their food or any other drinks but it's still a pretty delicious cup of tea.They have a pretty extensive menu compared to any boba tea houses I've been to and they sell a lot of tea.  Parking can be challenging but hey, it's Chinatown.  It's always super busy and the staff can be a bit snooty at times.  Oh well.  I'm just here to give my liver a break and to drink some milk tea.I don't have that many Asian friends, but when we have time to all hang out, Tea Station is always the place we go to catch up. And it seems like that's the case for most people here too. I've also come several times just to pick up an order I've called in or to wait while my car is being fixed up the street. I've been to Kung Fu Tea, Volcano Tea, and even the one in the Chinatown Mall on the first floor (forgot their name sorry!) And I always come back to Tea Station because of the large seating area, bright lighting inside, not smelling overly like fried foods, and the overall variety of food and drinks they have here. Oh and an important thing, I like the texture of the boba here the best! I wish they offered small boba though :( Where in Vegas is small boba?? Let's talk about service. It doesn't exactly exist, as most places in Chinatown. I would normally take off a star for how amazing they seem to be at hiding but I'm a little slack on the Chinatown places, so 4 stars it is just for the atmosphere, snacks and drinks.The go-to drinks (I always get them with boba): -Current favorites:  Hot Black Passion Tea & Rose Milk Tea -Hot Lavender Milk Tea -Mango/Coconut/Lychee Slush -Strawberry Pudding The go-to snacks:-Takoyaki (Octopus Balls)-Taiwanese Sausage -Fried Spicy ChickenAll three of these are salty and flavorful. Ultimate junky snack food lol & I seriously hate Honey Toast in general cause it's just a huge block of bread with honey and butter butttt it smells good, and the friends all love it here, so you may want to try it.Also, if you love sweet stuff and Mango, get their Mango shaved ice when it's in season. The Mango is so soft and juicy and sweet and they aren't stingy with the Mango either!Some tips:-Feel free to adjust the sweetness! They normally come pretty sweet so if you like less sweetness,  just tell them less sweet.-Always bring cash! You have to spend $10 minimum  to use card.-If you need assistance, don't be shy, flag someone down. They won't come to you otherwise lol -If you like Hot drinks, order the large and it comes in this gigantic cute bowl that's easily sharable for 2 people.Enjoy! :)
Barriques Market=I was so pleased with the personal attention I got in picking out a gift for the beer drinker in my life. I brought in chocolates that needed beer pairings and the staff enthusiastically found me matches without breaking my bank account. They took time to label beers for the appropriate chocolates and packed my beers in easy to carry boxes. Awesome!(Also, recently found my mom's favorite hard-to-find wine at Barriques.) Needless to say - stop for coffee, go gift shopping! Love.
Paisan's=There is no place in Madison that has as much history with me as Paisan's.  Years (like lots, and lots of years) ago in high school we would eat there after our state forensics meets - we drove 4 hours from Northern WI to get to Madison, and this was the highlight of our trip (well, that and getting to stay in a hotel without our parents, score!).  In college we went to their University Square location after every concert and recital because it was a short walk across the street from the Humanities building.  My roommate used to use her fake ID to buy their sangria. Once, I even went to eat just in the hopes of catching glimpse at the guy I was crushing on (now my husband) who was there with a friend that night. Paisan's has history for me.I don't love their new location as much as the old.  Even with the transported booths, it doesn't have the character as the original, but they tried. I've had amazing servers and so-so servers.  All of that aside...what I love about Paisan's is their consistency.  Their manicotti remains in my top 5 foods of all time...because it NEVER changes.  It's always served in the same plates, the same way, with an olive on top. The sangria. The mozzarella cheese bread. The porta salad.  It's all exactly the same as it was when I was a fresh-faced 15 year old, excited to be in Madison for the first time. To some people this might be frustrating, but to me, it's nostalgic and perfect.  No, Paisan's may not be the very best Italian food you can get in the Madison area. But it's good - and will always be one of my favorites!
Jojo's Pizza & Family Restaurant=Everything was great until I opened up the strawberry jam from the cheesecake to find mold.Pretty disappointing they would let that go out of the kitchen
El Gran Taco=I had lunch with Jacob L. in this rather charming little gem in Sunnyslope. The restaurant is bright, clean, and cheerfully decorated. The food was tasty and inexpensive. The rice and beans that came with my order were good. Of the 3 tacos I tried, I liked the pastor the best - it was really tasty; the carne asada was good, and the tongue was not as flavorful as I had expected but still OK (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/wQ4qreKh5KMxoo2WjsZumw/l). Good quality food, so  I'm definitely coming back here - probably on a weekend, to try the other dishes - especially the menudo. And of course I HAVE to get the flan.
Don Tortaco's=Were it not for my insatiable craving for carne asada fries, I would have never ventured over to this "local" side of Sahara Avenue.  This Roberto's is located right next door to PT's Pub, and I mean RIGHT NEXT DOOR.  Like, they share the same door and same wall.  So, as you're sitting in the tiny restaurant of Roberto's, enjoying your food, you'll definitely feel the bass of hip hop music bumping next door.  Or, if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to listen to every word of a horrible rendition of Babyface's "Everytime I Close My Eyes" during karaoke nights.So, how were the carne asada fries, you ask?  For $7.10, I thought they were on the pricey side.  They weren't as good as you'll find in San Diego, but good enough to whet my palate until I visit SD again.  The SO had them for the very first time and was intrigued with the whole french fries thing.  I didn't care too much for the huge dollops of sour cream and I thought the fries could have been served hotter.What was annoying about the service was that the guys behind the counter were working at the pace of snails.  And while people were waiting in line to order, the cashier was just chatting on his cell phone.  How rude!I work in the area and although have driven past many times I had never noticed this taco shop. Today while at work a few coworkers and I were wanting to pick up some grub for lunch so a friend suggested Don Tortacos. The best idea of the day was calling in an order which was promptly prepared for us. The services is great and their food looks and taste impressive. The items ordered were carne asada fries, hard shell carnitas tacos and a carne asada burrito.My burrito was Amazeballs, I swear it must have had at least two pounds of carne asada meat stuffed in it. I like my meat, I can handle my meat however this seemed a bit of a challenge for the first time in my life. This burrito was so good it made me horny. I was stimulated, I was aroused, I was wanting it over and over this day. I made love to my burrito with every flavorful bite and swallow. I will be back for sure, as I want to try other things on their menu that look irresistible. Food price is reasonable, friendly staff, a great salsa bar with those yummy spicy carrots and green salsa.I will be back for sure as it has left me yearning for more! I am a dirty little whore for this place.
Sonic Drive-In=Why no matter if you eat there or get it togo the burgers are never warm? I am not a fan of the Sonic... :(
Original Milano's Pizza=Racist racist racist. I came on a Wednesday for pizza for the first time and the cook decided that it was okay to to start spewing racial slurs and making references thinking I wouldn't hear him. Gross.
Country Boys Restaurants=You will find Country Boys Restaurant at the intersection of Camelback, I-17 and School Cafeteria Food Rd.They violated my 3B's of diner safety!  The breakfast food was OK, I didn't have a BLT, but my wife's burger was...not OK.  As soon as I saw that bad boy I recognized the perfectly preformed roundness and the unusual texture that says "cafeteria burger".But I waited for her reaction.  I tasted my side of home fries with onions and my single pancake.  The home fries were fine, slightly underdone but fine.  The pancake was also fine.  A tad sproingy but fine.  "How's your food?""The fries are good.""And the burger?""It's a little off.  Prefab and the flavor and texture are familiar, but from a long time ago.  I can't place it.""School cafeteria perhaps?""That's it.  Exactly."
The Men's Club of Charlotte=Please note that this review is for their Wednesday buffet, not the ladies or their gyrations. So, a friend and biz associate invited me out to what she quoted as "the best buffet in Charlotte" at The Men's Club. Skeptical as I was, I accepted as I love a great buffet. Plus she mentioned that there is a whole wall of desserts and that pretty much sealed the deal. I lunched with two female associates and one male associate. The venue: Yup, it's a strip club. All day. These ladies are working hard for their money. However, the space itself is really nice. It's clean, it's pretty, it's, well, almost luxe looking - at least in the semi dark dining area. The staff: Our waitresses were nice, efficient and fully clothed. That made digging into the buffet much easier. The food: Delicious. Seriously. It's a magical buffet full of so many different types of cuisines. Chef Brian is really nice and he was hanging out by the prime rib - yes, the actual meat - that is not a metaphor for something else. Everything was cooked well and there was enough variety for any palate. Big hits here: mac 'n cheese, asian chicken, perfectly steamed veggies and a nice fresh fruit spread. The dessert section wasn't at large as I thought but it filled the void for my sweet tooth.Overall: Would I go back? Sure, for the Wednesday buffet. My meal was taken care of by one of my dining partners, but for these 70+ buffet options the cost was $10 per person. If you can stomach viewing a bit of T&A during your lunch, definitely give this stellar buffet a try. Just don't face the stage and make sure to hide your singles.I have been an entertainer here for about 3 years off and on. All of the managers here are extremely professional, no drugs are inside this club which is rare. Girls here are very nice mature and pretty. Love the DJ. And love working at this club. Beautiful, wide range of dancers, cheap to go upstairs! Check it out!
Eldorado Grill=I'm so grateful that Ashley recommended us to visit Eldorado Grill for restaurant week! We managed to get seats within 20 minutes of calling. They set us down promptly and we quickly got settled with drinks and snacks to start! I love our starter - this gigantic bowl of guacamole and chips. The chips came out hot, so either they made their chips (hurray!) or they heated it up at least. The guacamole tasted delicious and we could stop getting more. Took 2 baskets of chips to finish the guacamole among 4 people (Thanks Ashley!).There was a myriad of drinks and if you're a fan of Tequila, you're in for a treat here! Onotse got Mojitos (2 actually, since it was that good), Ashley got a honey ginger alcoholic mix and Matt got a smokey tequila cocktail. Everyone enjoyed their drinks! So, restaurant week - for serving so many people of the same dish, I'm impressed. The Green Chile Pork stew was PERFECTLY done. soft pork that tears apart with the fork, the green chile was aptly spiced, not too hot but keeps you warm. LOVE IT. Onotse got a GIGANTIC salad for only $1.29. and it comes with lots of spinach, walnuts and some other things. Ashley got the jalapeno poppers, which looked just like bacon wrapped dates but instead of dates, there's jalapeno. She said she would get it again, but you should share it with some other person.Main dish, most of us got the smoked brisket. It was alright for me, not over the top, but the dish was a hearty meal. Lots of beans, lots of salad (no dressing), nice potato salad, lovely corn pancake (in place of corn bread). And the brisket was served on a piece of bread. Lots of meat to keep you full. But I was expecting more like braised beef, instead of spam-like texture? Definitely not something I would pick up again..Finally, for dessert, I got the pecan chile pie. I didn't like the crust since I'm a cookie/graham cracker crust fan.. Also, there was no obvious chile spice in the pie.. tasted more like pecan chocolate pie. It was alright. Matt got the mole root beer (mole ice cream), but sadly it had peanuts so the rest of us got to try it. It was REALLY spicy. Don't think anyone can finish that lump of spicy ice cream. spicy and cold at the same time, what an experience!!There's covered outdoor seating in the summer as well!HIT THE TRAIL FLAP JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKS!(They're where it's at you guys!)Eldorado and I didn't get off to a great start, but I'm here to tell ya, because of the noticeable improvement over the past 3 months, I've come to really enjoy the place! It takes some incredible leadership to cut through choppy waters and redirect what I decided a year ago was a sinking ship, and before I dig in and talk your ear off (your eyes off?) about the best pancakes you'll ever consume, I have to single out Eldorado's GM, Taylor, for being so interested in the success of the restaurant and implementing a wealth of feedback from the community. E-hug, buddy! And now, those cakes. I have consumed more Hit The Trail Flap Jacks in the month of May than I care to admit. I've also had more conversations about these rounders with various people than I care to admit. (Seriously, I have talked A LOT about these pancakes.) I really don't understand how something as simple as batter could taste so good. Maybe it's the addition of pumpkin seeds, pecans, almonds and raisins? Or maybe it's the cherries, apricots or red chile butter that's dolloped on top? Maybe it's the texture, which honestly you guys, is mind boggling good. They're fluffy, but hearty with a crisped outer edge and cake like insides. And they're HUGE. A serving of two is substantial. But you can also get one as a side if you're looking to add a little meat to your morning and want some strips of bacon or sausage, like I did last time. When I learned that you can order just one cake, my world changed. Changed!  People always tell me Eldorado has one of the best brunches in town, and because of a few rocky encounters right after I moved here I sort of dismiss everyone and decide they don't know what they're talking about. But I've had brunch, several times this month, and I can safely say this will be your new favorite spot. The menu is extensive and spans traditional American and more tex-Mex inspired plates on par with their dinner menu. The added convenience of being able to make a reservation on Sunday morning ROCKS. And though it's small, the outdoor space is lovely when a breeze blows past. Make a reservation for Sunday. Get some Hit The Trail Flap Jacks. Explain to me why they're so damn good.
Broadway Pizzeria=Yum I think we have found a new go to spot to add to our rotation of options for a good pizza pie!My boyfriend and I just happened upon this joint via a coupon in the local edition of the 2013 entertainment guide as we wanted to try a new place. There was a coupon for 50% off of any pizza so I quickly yelped it and saw a four star rating. I read some of the reviews which boasted of their famous garlic knots as well so there we went to satisfy our pizza fix!We decided on the 16' uptown white pizza (mozzarella), their other white pizza is made with ricotta cheese instead. We also got an order of one dozen garlic knots that come with a side of marinara sauce.Wow, the pizza was delicious and drizzling with olive oil, and the garlic knots were fresh with butter and garlic! The crust and generous amount of cheese on the pizza was Amazing. I had an orgasm of flavor in my mouth and it felt and tasted so damn good!They took $7.00 off of our pizza with the 50% off coupon we had so our large pizza and dozen garlic knots total only came to $12 which is a bargain for so much food!We will be back and now we have a paper menu to review which is full of so many of their great food options to try!We are fans!First star: I'm in agreement with everyone else that the ranch dressing here is like crack. It's garlicky and delicious, and I'm not normally a ranch fan.Second star: I appreciate that they sell both Neapolitan and Sicilian pies, both whole and by the slice. Get a classic cheese slice, or add a topping. If you opt for meatball, it's a good amount, chopped and spread out over the slice. Neapolitan crust is crisper than expected but the cheese and sauce were very light and not particularly flavorful.Third star: they have several different lunch combos, available Mon-Fri til 3PM. Most are $7-10, including various pastas, salads, sandwiches, and slices. They get surprisingly busy during a mid-week lunch, but service is quick and efficient.
Athen's Gyros & Pasta=Whoa!  That's allot of meat!I stopped here for a quick lunch.  I had the Gyro combo.  Everything tasted just as expected.  It's funny how you can get a Gyro at some little place in Anycity, USA and it will taste almost exactly the same.  Sort of the Greek equivalent of the Big Mac.  There must be only one supplier for the Gyro loaf that they all use.What I would have liked from Athen's was 50% less meat and 100% more onion, tomato and dressing.  I left them a Yelp card so hopefully they will read the review.  My Gyro had easily enough meat for 2 sandwiches.  I was tossing off meat.Did I just say tossing off meat?
Bill Johnsons Big Apple=Some girlfriends of mine wanted to meet up for a Sunday breakfast, and Bill Johnson's was the place that was picked.  I have to be honest when I heard this was the place I thought, well hell Bill Johnson's isn't even a place I would pick to go for dinner.So off I went to meet up with them. Ok I under estimated Bill Johnson's for sure! We had a table in the saloon area, and our waitress was Cookie! Man she was awesome! Cookie was the greatest!  She kept us stocked in coffee, water, creamer and more! Her personality was always upbeat! I ordered an Arizona Omelets, which had Schreiner's fresh chorizo, green chilies, and tomatoes, pepper jack cheese with a side of home fries and a biscuit and gravy! OK this was a kick ass breakfast! Everything was delish!! The omelet was light, fluffy and full of flavor; the home fries were perfectly cooked. The biscuit and gravy, oh damn, that's some good stuff, my country lovin side was so very happy!!!  Biscuit & Gravy are my favorite breakfast dishes!  It was a great meal with friends, amazing service as well!Went here Friday night with my wife Carol and our friend Kathy for Karaoke in the bar/saloon. We arrived early for dinner (around 6pm), Karaoke started at 7pm. I have to admit it's been years sine I've been here and when I used to go it was in the restaurant not the bar/saloon..We were immediately seated and ask what we wanted to drink  and then the waitress (her name was Cookie) took our order Carol & Kathy ordered the all-y-u-can-eat fish, I asked if I could try a small piece before I ordered.  Cookie said that would be no problem.Cookie brought out drinks and me two small pieces of fish. I tasted it and decided I would order it as well.. When the fish came the pieces we very large and piping hot. The batter wasn't to heavy and the fish was mouthwateringly moist, flaky, tender and tasty. We all agreed we like the fish was cooked perfectly, which is a rarity.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Freshness characterizes everything we had. Highly recommended I was pleasantly surprised . The service was excellent and the food was served promptly and efficient. Freshness characterizes everything FOOD: Huge portions, Top quality SERVICE: Genuine good service which was a joy to witness. Our waitress was professional and attentive. PRICE: Comparable to other steak restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. Yet popular with the locals and a place to bring out of town guests.  CONCLUSION: RETURN FACTOR 100%. ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH
Portofino's=Authentic, tasty and hearty Italian cookin that even my wonderful, Italian grandma wouldn't mind diving into - and that's saying a lot. Yes, my grandmother is one of the best cooks in the world (major bias, I'm sure) but Portofino's throws down some damn tasty eats.I stopped by Portofino's to catch up with a friend over a casual lunch. While their menu looked pretty enticing I went with their lunch special "bake": two jumbo stuffed shells, one manicotti, baked and covered in meat sauce. While I can't get grandma's cookin' in Charlotte, this was a very solid substitute! The shells and manicotti were perfectly cooked (not overly so) and stuffed with delicious ricotta. And the sauce - purty tasty too - although I would have been delighted with another manicotti and less sauce. But that's just personal preference!The service was friendly and attentive and I never went without at least a half-full beverage. Plus, the prices are pretty affordable - my bake was $7.95. Not bad! I absolutely want to come back and try their 'za and maybe a whole tray of desserts. Nom!
17th Street Cafe=HORRIBLE TREATMENT.  After having been a very frequent customer, we went to the cafe around 4:30 on a Friday.  The food has always been priced a little high for the quality, but it is a local business and my boss is a local businessman.  He likes to dine other small businesses..  This past visit it was dead empty with the exception of staff.  It was my boss, his young-adult children and a fourteen month old baby and me.  We were seated and enjoying a little of wine, the most expensive bottle on their very limited and impressively unimpressive wine list.  What WAS outrageous was that the horrible way the owner treated us.  Out of nowhere, and I must remind you, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant, the owner came over and demanded we make the baby stop pounding on the table.  ...not my baby, and I'm one of those people who doesn't really like noisy kids, but I'm telling you, that was not the situation.  These were chubby baby hands on the table with a laughing baby...and who were we bothering?  We thought he was joking until we saw the look on his fat face.  My boss said "just pack our food to go". The owner turned around, not even out of earshot of our table and said "that a--hole wants is food to go.  Pack that sh-- up and get him the f--- out of here."Small wonder the place was empty.  Overpriced food, lousy wine selection and not even a friendly neighborhood atmosphere.  This is a NO GO.
Winchells Donuts=Yeah I know, a commercial establishment which I normally don't visit, however this location deserves a good Yelp! Open 24/7, all donuts fresh fried and glazed. I walked in and looked at the display rack of fresh donuts, literally saw them glistening with their generous freshly just glazed icing. $7.99 for a dozen, well 14 donuts to be exact, not sure if that is standard or just because I walked in with two nice big plump donuts of my own? Anyhow that is a steal for fresh, moist, melt in your mouth donuts at 2am. Service is great, I mean really I don't expect mind blowing service from a donut shop, much less at 2am. Also does not take much skill or thrill to fill a box with donuts. The gentleman working this particular early morning shift had lots of spunk and vigor. He is one with tons of personality, joking and told me my total was 7 million dollars, you know those funny types. Really refreshing considering he works graveyard! Yay Winchell's, (S. Jones location) as I can not speak for the rest as a lot of them are franchise now. This location rocks!24/7 donuts, bagels, coffee, and sandwiches- what more could you ask for?! Service is quick, fast, and usually bilingual. The bagel sandwiches are a favorite of mine, as well as their iced hazelnut coffee. If you need to grab breakfast for your work squad, call ahead for a discount: the Winchell's dozen (14 assorted glazed and filled donuts, bars, and twists) is entirely customizable and regularly $10, but calling ahead with a large order has saved me a few bucks, thanks to friendly management. But I keep coming back for the sandwiches: $5 for a bagel sando packed with fresh toppings, add a dollar for chips and a drink. The turkey is my go-to, but the BLTCC (BLT + cream cheese) is a tasty indulgence too, if you opt for savory over sweet. Note that the bagels themselves are not of stellar quality- they can be a bit hard (rather than chewy) even when they're not toasted.
Prince of India=I visited this restaurant with a friend for lunch a week ago.  We were having an informal lunch meeting to talk about some business, so I suggested this place and a couple of others that were convenient for both of us.  She chose Prince of India, so we both met up here around noon.Technically, I'd been once before, but I hadn't actually eaten anything here because I'd already had dinner, so I count this as being my first time.  The food is your typical Indian buffet fare, including chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, saag, pita bread, navratan korma, and rice on the hot bar, and several vegetables and sauces on the cold bar.  I picked up some of all of the aforementioned dishes, plus some cucumber yogurt sauce from the cold bar.  I found the food pretty average in quality for Indian buffet food--not great, but not horrible, either.  Because I wasn't terribly impressed, I stuck with one plate, and didn't go for seconds.At the time of our visit, the dining room was pretty quiet, so it was a good place to have a business lunch.  (Indeed, I spotted one of my supervisors in the row of tables on the other side talking to a colleague...)  The decor is pretty nondescript for an Indian restaurant, with one TV playing Bollywood music videos in the back.If you study or work at Pitt or UPMC, be sure to bring your ID to take advantage of the $1 discount.  The lunch buffet price is $9, which is pretty average for the area.  Given the average food, average decor, average prices, and even average service, the main thing this place has going for it is convenience for those who work in Oakland.  If you're able to do so, I'd recommend walking down Atwood or over to Craig to check out the superior Indian offerings there.  However, if you need a quiet, uncrowded place for lunch and don't want to walk any further than Fifth Ave., Prince of India will do just fine.
Romano's Macaroni Grill=Yikes, what happened to Macaroni Grill?!?!?!? I used to love coming here. We did get seated right away but getting acknowledged by our server after being seated was another story. They seemed very busy. After quenching my thirst because I finally got my drink ordering was under way. I asked for a "House Salad" with extra ranch to start. Then for my meal I ordered the "Build Your Own Pasta". It was noodles, arrabbiata sauce and buffalo mozzarella. The server brought me a caesar salad instead if the house salad I ordered. Then brought the right salad after I was almost finished with my pasta. The food was good but service was lacking very much. It was clean inside and they just finished a remodel so they now have both booths and tables to sit at. They still have the curbside to go if you want to phone in an order to go.Outside is a nice patio should you feel like eating outdoors.This place is hit or miss and after my last experience I'm thinking it will be a miss for a while. I have stopped by several times since they introduced the "express lunch service" where when you order from the express menu you get your order in 7 minutes or less for $7. Each time I went in for lunch the manager gave me a BOGO coupon and said that even after it was expired that he'd still honor it. Sounds nice but I'm sure it's because the location is hurting. Inside there has either been nobody dining inside or maybe 2 table with customers while i"m waiting for my order. The only thing I have had that's been worth it is a sausage and rigatoni dish. It's a good portion and tastes decent but a lot of the other menu items have been terrible and not worth the $7 let alone anything higher. I got a bit sick after eating the caprese sandwich as well the pulled pork sandwich. They will give you a free loaf of bread and some oils to go but you will have to ask for it to guarantee getting it.Had I written this review about 8 years ago, I would have happily given this establishment a 5/5 review. Unfortunately, times have changed and the fairly recent revamping of the menu, cooking styles, and value has fallen short in recent years. Today my Dad was visiting and he wanted to take the kids to lunch. He had several gift cards to Romano's Macaroni Grill so off we went. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately. If this review was strictly based on the service, I would have no problem giving them a 5/5. Unfortunately, the food quality alone takes this review to the 3/5 mark. The Rosemary bread and oil accompaniment was delicious as always. The service by Sandra was excellent on all levels. Quick to refill drinks and quick to bring additional bread as requested. The appetizers and main dishes, however, left much to be desired. My dad ordered two appetizers: one of stuffed mushrooms, which appeared to be extremely greasy and possibly frozen; and other of Calamari which was an extremely small serving and though tasty, were a bit over-fried. For my main course, I had the $10 3 course lunch special. It included a single triangle of fried cheese, a small Caesar salad, and a main dish which I picked the Fettucini Gorgonzola. Though it was okay, the cheese sauce was layered in oil and dripped off each piece of pasta, leaving me with a sunken stomach and an overall bloated feeling. It really seems like the quality of the food has taken a strong dive in recent years and it is because of the food quality alone that I must give them a 3/5.Service was 2 stars, the guy did not want to be there. Food was 3.5 stars I had a Pollo Caprese which is a grilled chicken breast in a lemon butter type sauce served with thin noodles and cherry tomato sauce. It also had 4 small bites of cheese which I suppose was homemade mozzarella? While it was all good, it was just boring. Nothing stood out and said "Hey you really like this" Just average food. Now I remember why it has been years since we have been there.
Ruby Tuesday=F&#%$* FANTASTIC!!Another FREEBIE for joining the E-Club. FREE Handcrafted Gourmet Burger!!I decided to try the Boston Bleu-Burger cooked medium with bleu cheese & steak sauce made with Sam Sdams Boston Lager!!yeah...sounds good don't it!!BEST damn burger I've ever had!!! I almost lost a finger!!Prices are reasonable $8.99 burger, looks like a real cool place to eat and a small bar too. Only thing is just 2 locations both in NE/NW Las Vegas.If you haven't checked this place out DON'T WAIT!!
Captain Steve's=??? did you follow me, to see if I was gonna do it.. Well... I've done it.This is another place that my job at the time used often. We would have about 8 orders from my job at the time.I almost wanna write 2 reviews so the place could get 10 stars from me. I love this place. (check the open and closing time).This place has been around for a many years. Actually has a 2nd location. Everytime I speak on this place, I tell ppl that they will bring you a TO-GO BOX when they bring your food out b/c YOU WILL NOT finish the food. Salt & Pepper fish, shrimpNot sure why in the south ordering Tea is heard as... "PLEASE BRING ME BROWN SUGAR WATER...PLEASE...PLEASE"... no biggie, its the norm around these parts. No knock on this place. I always get the Create you Combo... 3 for (I forgot how much) instead of the Create Your Own 2 for (I forgot how much) your choice of BROILED, FRIED, BLACKENDDifferent choices of Fish, Scallops, Oysters, Shrimp,Scallops are huge, Oysters are ummm OysterYHushpuppies are good... (I usually only eat 3 or 4...don't want to get full off fried bread balls)-----   Only knock on this place is the PARKING LOT.......... ROCKS/DIRT. I just washed my car, all shiny and sparkley, tires lookin wet...UNTILLLLLLLLLLL!!!! EKK EKKK EKKKKKI hit the parking lot. This location in S.C. probably offers MORE food to plate ratio. (since its the original location). I often ordered the Crab Legs to go from the SC location. I'll think I'll write a review on the other location as well.  (CTRL + C, CTRL V) this article. Go Enjoy
Tang Dynasty=Hmmm maybe I came on an off time because my service was quite good, although I was also one of the few tables in here. Before I came here for a visit, I was looking at a New York yelper's food blog. Strangely enough she was talking about where some of the best Chinese food and that it can be found in the strangest of places. She mentioned this place, I knew I had to stop by to try it. I really liked this place. Prices were very fair and the portions were just enough to make me full but not stuff me. I came here for lunch and had their ginger chicken and asked them to make it extra spicy. I started off with their egg drop soup, which unlike many that I have had, didn't need me to add extra salt. My ginger chicken came out, for a lunch portion I was very happy with the portion I got, filled with veggies, a slightly sweet and spicy sauce paired with  the fried rice I chose which was just okay. For a filled tummy, cute although some what hokey decor, I left and I was a happy man.
Penn Brewery=We came in after spending the day at the Science Center.  Love the courtyard dining area, but we wanted air conditioning and to check out the inside.  We got a monster table all to ourselves.  Nice.  Even nicer was the view of downtown.BJ got a Penn Wheatson beer.  It was very good, simliar to a Blue Moon or a Hoeggarten.  Since we were feeling a little German, BJ got the pierogi plate and I got käsespätzle.  We liked both our dishes.  My accompanying salad had some brown pieces of lettuce. But I forgave that because our server was kind enough to bring us a sample of the hot German potato salad.  All in all, a pretty decent meal.  But of course, we always going to like any brewery.
Zebra Restaurant=I travel extensively and globally, entertaining customers and enjoy the opportunity to try some of the best ,and unfortunately some of the most overrated, places in major cities.Unfortunately, Zebra falls into the category of "I'm not going there again." The waiter starts off with the special entrees and give us the pitch on the oysters and the scallop appetizers. We socialize a bit and he comes back and four of us place our orders. After a bit, the waiter comes back to inform us our appetizer (oysters) are actually sold out and he's very sorry. We order an Oregon Pinot, Penner Ash, a solid good Shea Vineyard selection which we've tried before.The menu is a bit over the top. Every dish seems to have something in it to kill the patron. For example the "Simple Fish" is a flounder in and wine and butter sauce with some tapenade....blah, blah, blah...the covered with a lobster tail with some cream sauce. I'm like "what?, that's simple?" Finally, I asked what's the lightest thing on the menu and was directed to chicken in a hollandaise sauce. Get REAL folks!. You can't eat this ostentatious crap and 1) expect it to be "French food", and 2) expect to continue live to the next day. I was in France less than 6 months ago. The French do not eat this crap. OK, I'll get off my soapbox....the menu was extreme, but there were some salad options as starters.Personally, I had the Zebra salad which was good and had organic greens, raspberry and citrus fruits. I ended up ordering the simple fish w/o the lobster and w/o the sauce. If the flounder is good, why ruin it? It was ok. We shared a dessert and coffee afterwards.Then, we got the check which totaled about $400 for 4 people with 1 bottle of wine. We couldn't figure out how this happened until we realized we either misread, (or our menu was incorrect), the price of the Penner Ash....it was $155 and we thought it was $70. We called the waiter back and he said he's see what he could do. I googled the wine and the full retail price on the web ranges from 38.99 to 52.99. 400% markup on wine is unheard of! Even if we made a mistake, we were appalled and disappointed at Zebra's pricing and subsequent treatment. Needless to say, we paid and left. (Zebra did offer us 10% off the wine after the waiter phoned the owner.)The ambiance is good, service is raw for a "fine french restaurant" and food average or sub-optimal. Combine this with ridiculous mark-up and my suggestion is find another place to dine. The place won a lot of awards and realizing I'm going against the grain, however, this isn't 21st century good food, good service or even a good menu.  I'm very disappointed with this selection.(Definitely falls into Yelp's "splurge" category without the complete "experience")WARNING - this is a LONG review, but I wanted to do Zebra justice. I took a BIG chance here on a "special" Valentine's Day dinner with my wife. I say this because most of our experiences with "special" meals have not turned out to be very good (California Wine Country restaurants excluded - everyone was phenomenal). Anyway, I digress....So I signed up for the 4 course dinner of $85/person. Certainly not the cheapest, but also quite a bargain (if you can call it that) in comparison to other larger cities given the Quality, quantity and special occasion (for example - a similar meal in Vegas would be $150 ++ EACH....see what I mean?).There were about 4 or 5 choices for each of the four courses, so it was nice having those choices. Of course, my French Canadian wife beat me to the seared Fois Gras, and I had the Mushroom Truffle soup. Well, all I can say is HOLY $^*%#! was that ever good! My wife and I have had the fortune of dining at some of the very best restaurants on this continent, and I've got to say that my Mushroom Truffle soup, of which they added some FOIS GRAS to, was superbly sublime.....is that a term? I don't care, I'm using it anyway. Of course her Fois Gras was Fois Gras. Food Perfection. So off to an AWESOME start.Second course was a salad course. They have a special "Zebra" salad, but the waiter (and Wine Steward Michael) suggested I try their version of a Beet Salad, with Roquefort Cheese and candied walnuts. Now I admit to NOT being a huge beet fan, but Michael convinced me that they do theirs very differently. I said WTF and went for it. And I am very glad I did! I don't know what they marinaded their beets in, but it didn't have that typical "beet flavor." And as I get older, Blue Cheese tastes better and better to me (never been my favorite in the past). And paired with the beets and crunch of the candied walnuts, with some mircrogreens, it was again, AWESOME! 2 for 2.Main course for the wife was Tournedos of Beef, with a Bordelais sauce. Meat was perfectly cooked, and there was actually a lot of it (surprising for a French restaurant - like 8 oz). I got their signature Pasta Basket, which was freshly made pasta made into a basket (looked like a bird's next), filled with fresh Shrimp, Scallops, Lobster and Filet Mignon. I mean, come on! How could I not order that! And here's the somewhat strange part - they deep fry the entire thing for like a minute until everything is cooked to perfection. Now this was a surprise, and it was my #3 AWESOME rating for the night......you're on a roll Zebra.Dessert, my wife was pretty full (couldn't eat all her Tournedos so I had to man up to help....:-) so she got the standard Creme Brulee, which was quite good. I got the Souffle, complete with dark Belgian Chocolate. Now I would expect a French themed restaurant to be able to cook a Souffle properly, and Zebra did that to perfection! That Dark Belgian Chocolate poured down the center was divine! While the Creme Brulee was standard fare (though quite good), my Souffle made this the #4 AWESOME rating for the night.Now I haven't mentioned the Piece de Resistance.....the WINE. I asked for something "different" (meaning, not the usual Cab Sauv, Zin, etc.) So Michael, the Wine Steward, recommended a wine from a Napa maker called Falcor Bilancia. This is a Meritage (rhymes with Heritage) wine consisting of the unusual blend of Zin, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Charbono! At 15.4% alcohol, this was a BIG wine, but typical for CA, well balanced and YUMMY! AT least for us lovers of BIG BOLD wines. Perhaps not the BEST pairing for some of the more delicate food items we had, but it was the BEST WINE for the evening. Splurged $110 for this bad boy. Expensive? Sure. Worth it? Absolutely!All in all an expensive but AWESOME meal, top to bottom. The wait staff was excellent, Michael the young Wine Steward was excellent. Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. Michael knew this regular customer in the table next to us, and they were drinking a wine, also from the maker Falcor, called "Parker Em." Michael said that this was a very limited release wine, and it almost had a "Cult status" (meaning, Screaming Eagle, etc.). He asked that customer if I could have a sip of the Parker Em if I gave him a taste of my Bilancia. He agreed, and man was that Parker Em AWESOME, in a different way that my Bilancia was. While the Bilancia was reminiscent of a Duckhorn Paraduxx wine, the Parker Em reminded me oh so much of a 1997 Joseph Phelps Insignia, a near 100 point wine. Never did this in a restaurant before, so it was a tremendous experience, especially given the quality of these wines.So would I recommend Zebra! 1000000000000000000000000% YES! They have special wine tastings and wine dinners to, and I can't wait to attend some of those! Oh, and not every visit has to be a Prix Fixe experience and super expensive. I think the next time we'll just go for a nice quite evening and simply order off the menu. Bon Appetite!Went for valentine's dinner and as mentioned in other reviews, the tables are very close to one another making it not romantic at all. The waiter was the most rude person I have ever met, he has no business being in the service industry. First offense: The salads that came out were not the salads we ordered. I didn't want to complain because the salad I had in front of me looked good but my husband's did not so he decided to tell the waiter. The waiter promptly took our plates and gave them to another table across the room. Unfortunately this happened after I had taken a bite of my salad. Thankfully I noticed what had happened and warned the recipient of the used salad before they dug in. When the manager came over to ask about the situation he made no apology and somehow found nothing wrong with giving someone a salad touched by someone else. Then this same situation happened to the table sitting next to us. Second offense: Upon receiving our main course my husband asked if the waiter could describe the dish (partly because he was worried he would have the same switch-up happen) and the waiter just replied with "food." Looking back on it, this would have been a funny response had I been in a fast food chain and not pay $270 for a below par meal. The food was average and nothing special. I would never ever go back and feel that I was robbed.
Munch-A-Sub=Munch a Sub makes me want to munch on a sub.What I am honestly a fan of is their breakfast menu. They offer good food at reasonable rates. The English muffin sausage with cheese is huge and the sausage is King of that meal. Whether you want to walk in or have delivery this place is a must. It is good, fresh and tasty food.You can't go wrong with their roast beef sandwich, one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They have like 30 options to chose from when it comes to their lunch menu.Want something local with a lots of flavor? Then this is must do for you.Munch a sub? More like Massive Subs! This spot is semi-hidden in the warehouse area, and a hot spot for blue-collar boys grabbing lunch. Portions are large and prices are fair, with most 6" sandwiches clocking in at a mere $8 and change. Menu also offers some soups, pastas, and specials, like chili cheese dogs.The #43 is a roast beef and turkey combo, with super-fresh bread and an ample amount of meat. My only gripe is that I added provolone and didn't receive it, so maybe this isn't the best place for customized orders. BF was a little underwhelmed with the Pastrami sando, with minimal melted swiss and thousand island sauce, but it's definitely a large amount of meat.Service was friendly and quick. Interior is clean with a ton of seating crammed into the small spot, ~30 chairs. Crowd is mostly men from the nearby businesses- if you're a single lady looking for a nice guy with a good job, try stopping in here to pick up more than your lunch! ;)
Orient Kitchen=The waitress/owner is the worst I have ever experienced.  Sure, her English is bad, but her attitude is worse.I went in with allergies/a cold after 3pm. yesterday evening, hoping to get a soup to comfort me.  She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table, even when lunch was technically over.She went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table.  She came back to my table and I wasn't ready.  It took her 10 minutes to return.  She turned up her nose at me, and began chatting (loudly) with the sushi chef.  My body language showed I was ready, but she came over when she was good and ready.I said that I wanted soup, and asked her for her recommendation, since I was feeling under the weather.  I guess she was disappointed in my order.  She refused to apply herself to the question, giving short, sharp answers, avoiding eye contact, and then stating, "Everyone is different," so a recommendation was not possible.  She left again for an extended period of time.  I had time to look around at the dirty carpet.  She brought no tea or water.I asked about the spring rolls; were they fried?  She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude.  "Excuse me?" I thought to myself, "Does Orient equate with Chinese?"I asked if she had ginger tea.  She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone, and I had better be okay with that!Finally I ordered the Miso soup.  It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough.  I asked for the tea twice, since it appeared she did not hear me.  She barked at me with the equivalent, "Alright already."  She plopped it on the table.  Later, when I was finished with my soup, she put her fingers all over the tea nossle.  That was effective in making me leave promptly.  Again, my body language communicated, "Check please!" but she chatted with the sushi chef, never letting him get a word in edgewise.I waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip.  I mumbled "Never again!" as I left, determined to never frequent this establishment, and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear.  As I drove around the back, the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner.I had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before.
Gino's Italian Deli=Who knew?No seriously...Who knew this was here? Solid marketplace for on the fly Italian ingredients and a decent Italian beef sammie. Wish there was more space to eat than the two tables which practically feel outside given the draft, but I think this could quickly be a great grab-n-go option for me on that side of town.
Saigon Noodles=Unlike many women, I don't really like shopping....that's why I was so happy to discover that Saigon Noodles is practically next door to West Towne Mall!  Food really motivates me so I won't mind shopping and grabbing some pho this winter.  Saigon Noodles is clean, nicely decorated, has a great menu, and their pho is pretty great.  I was disappointed that the difference in price between regular and large pho is pretty crazy....I highly recommend splashing out that extra $1 for twice as much pho!  The service here is pretty basic....nothing more than a "hi," "what do you want to order?" and "ready for the check?"....but you can't have everything!
Macayo Vegas=Mmm...Macayo....Me like you lots!M elt in your mouth incredibly delishA ddicting C heese that is out of this worldA gain, AddictingY ou only wish you had someO nly in Vegas....Oh, and ArizonaI don't eat Mexican food often though, if I had one of these places close to where I live, I would probably turn in to a burrito.I'm talken lip smaken, melt in your mouth, wanna slap someone flippen DELICIOUS!! We got one order of there cheese nachos which was AMAZING!! I have not had nachos in years so, this was a major decadent explosion of cheesy goodness that feed the deep rooted cheese addict in me.   I also ordered some sort of Cheese Chicken quesadilla though, it was called something else- It was A Thick fluffy tortilla, stuffed with thick chunks of chicken with again, the most incredibly flavorful cheese I literally have ever had, all with some superbly fantabulous guacamole on the side....needless to say, I felt the size of a super burrito when I left.This place really is addicting. I don't know what kind of flavor they add to there cheese though, it is any cheese lover's idea of heaven.The overall appearance of the restaurant is nothing fancy and just a typical Mexican chain joint , the service is probably a hit and miss though,  the food.....you just have to try.
Park Central Deli=Park Central Deli. Not to be confused with Central Park Deli on the upper westside. There a few similarites. Believe me Nancy. On the poz side for PCDCLEAN! Super, mega clean. Very impressed. I could see my reflection in the shiny floors. And I almost ran into a busboy while admiring myself, but dayum, them was some clean tiles!FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! Yes, the sandwich experts behind the counter were most polite and efficient. On the negativo side for PCDWell. The sandwich. Ugh. And that's why I"m there. Rye was dry. Pastrami was, um, well, what the hell ryhmes with pastrami. Um, oh, I know....pastrami was no a yummy...OK. I'm trying people. And the slaw. You know what I'm gonna say. The slaw...drum roll please.... WAS BLAH! As in bland. Not sweet. Not sour. Ugh.On the poz side for CPD....Well it's in New York baby! What else do you need?There's a surprisingly fabulous, modern patio at PCD. Seriously worth checking out for a "mall" establishment. I'll go back. Perhaps to try another deli delight. Or maybe to hurl my sandwich in the Koi pond. Even though the sign says not to feed the fish. HA! I'm de elited and a rebel biatches!!!!!And maybe, just maybe, I'll wear my I HEART NY t shirt.
Marché Bacchus=Happily, we didn't experience the problems that we did at my birthday dinner here last year, probably because we went on a Tuesday night.  We were seated right at the edge of the lake, with a beautiful view of a full moon and Jupiter (thanks, Android app!).  We shared a bottle of the best Riesling ever, and also a warm spinach salad, with pancetta and a bread crisp spread with goat cheese - yum!Alas, the restaurant was out of the hanger steak that we - and every table around us - wanted to order.  The waiter said they hadn't gotten their meat delivery today as planned.  Instead, I had the Trout, which was served with a topping of crabmeat, haricots verts, and balsamic-soaked shallots.  It had way too much salt for my taste, but I was going to keep it anyway.  Instead, the waiter whisked it away, the owner, Jeff, came over and said that the kitchen would whip up a fresh one, with no salt at all added.  And they did, quickly!  Yes, the fish could have used a touch of salt, but not after I spread out that balsamic drizzle.  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband had the salmon, and it was also terrific.We had ordered - 30 minutes ahead, as required - the house special bread pudding with cinnamon sauce.  Two other tables had birthday celebrants, and they had the usual candle and Happy Birthday jingle sung.  My bread pudding was served sans candle, and no Happy Birthday song.  Instead, the waiter got down on one knee, took my hand, and serenaded me with a very professional rendition of "La Vie en Rose!"  Edith Piaf herself couldn't have done it better.  The icing on the cake, so to speak, was that the house comped my birthday dessert, even after we presented our restaurant.com certificate.  A far cry from last birthday's mess, when all the hassles and waiting produced nothing at all.  All in all, it was a terrific dining experience, a wonderful dinner, and we're not going to wait a whole 'nother year to return.One of the best off the strip restaurants I've been to in this town. What the exterior lacks in curb appeal (it's located in a dated strip mall with a non-descript facade) the interior more than makes up for it with a quaint, romantic atmosphere not found elsewhere in Las Vegas. It's two biggest selling points: a wine shop and a patio overlooking a lake.I love the wine shop! With several rows of wines displayed, there are plenty of varietals to choose and a wide range of prices for both the big spenders and the penny pinchers (I'm somewhere in between). So, after you check in at the host stand -- which is by the front door at the cash register -- peruse their wine selection and take it to the table with you. They'll just add the wine to your dinner check, plus a ten dollar corkage fee.There's a small indoor dining area, but the best place to sit is on their patio. During the winter it's enclosed and has heat lamps so you'll be able to dine there year-round. Don't expect a breathtaking view. We're not talking about one of the Great Lakes. It's in a desert, after all, so the body of water is fairly small. But the overall experience and atmosphere is one that is unique to the city.The food is very good. The menu is on the conservative side, with items that will be familiar to most everyone. It's French-inspired American food that's executed extremely well.The ahi and bacon app ($15) was a nice mix of flavors and textures with its pickled pineapple, glazed bacon, chive and chili oil. It's a small dish, with two seared slices of tuna and one thick cut of bacon, but tasty, nonetheless.For entrees my wife had the mushroom risotto ($18) -- a large and perfectly seasoned portion served in a shallow bowl. I went with the braised short rib ($28) -- a large, tender slab of beef sitting on a generous helping of blue cheese mashed potatoes and topped with crispy shallots. Neither dish stood a chance... we devoured both with nothing left behind.We ended the meal with a delicious bread pudding ($8) -- freshly baked to order and served with cinnamon rum sauce. Served in a large ramekin, it's good enough for three, maybe four people.The service was professional and courteous without being too overbearing. The prices were excellent. With our restaurant.com gift certificate we ended up paying about $130 total. That's a far cry from what we would normally spend on the Strip for a similar meal. With its decidedly anti-Vegas ambiance, this place is a hit for any special occasion.The best thing about this place is the view on the patio. I've never bought wine here, so this review has nothing to do with that part.I've been here a few times now, and I'm not impressed. The last time, I made a reservation for brunch for a party of 11 around 1pm. I wanted a nice relaxing scene for my friends the morning after my birthday party. The reasons I am not impressed with this place of business -The staff was not so pleasant. They seemed to be looking at our group with more of a "snotty" attitude and they seemed to not be very genuine. The waitress, Emily was not at all tentative. She seemed annoyed that we had a large group and she didn't ask to refill half of the groups drinks, took over 30 minutes just to ask what we wanted to order, drinks and food. We had to call out to her over 3 times just to get her attention. I don't ever see this being necessary.It literally took us 2 hours just to eat and pay. Only due to the fact that she did take care of us. It was not busy. She was not busy. If it was busy there, we all would have understood. I watched her as she tended to other tables and she was great with them. Not one person asked for a manager or complained to her, because the group does not like to cause a scene or  problems. The same group ate out 2 other times over the weekend, and we never had problems elsewhere. I never thought it would be a problem having a larger group there, due to being there at other times and seeing other large groups dining here. The food here has always been good. That is on the plus side. If you are picky about service, I have not had one amazing experience here. I've had decent service with just my boyfriend and I dining here. I always tip a minimum of 20%. If it's awesome service, I tip over 30%. I gave her the bare minimum of 15%, she honestly deserved less. I appreciate great service because I've been in this industry for over 10 years. I hope this restaurant sees this review and I hope they revamp their customer service. It doesn't matter what your group looks like (rich, middle class or poor), how large or small your group is, you should always be willing to provide the best service to all of your customers equally. Each person in the group was very disappointed with our service and I was embarrassed for bringing them here. We are not a rowdy or raggedy looking bunch. Just people who are happy to eat good food. No matter how good the food/view/ambiance is, if you have horrible service, it ruins everything.2.5 STARS ~!!!My boyfriend and I haven't really had time to celebrate our 2 year anniversary so this was kind of our 2 year & 2+ months anniversary dinner thing haha. I've had this place bookmarked for forever and it seemed like a good fit for us since we wanted something low-key and didn't want anything on the strip. I made reservations a couple weeks ago and requested a table right along the edge right by the water which is the only reason I chose this restaurant...I've worked in food and beverage so I know requests can't be guaranteed but they are still possible to grant with proper planning and especially if it is for a special occasion. When we got to the restaurant the hostess had 0 personality. Not even a smile, a welcome, a how are you, happy anniversary..nothing.. just borderline rudeness! I don't know if she was new but she seemed a little flustered. At that point a server came around and angrily asked her why she would seat a 6 top party with no menus.. and she mumbled something back.. IDK it was just a really weird start to the night and a bad first impression of the restaurant. We waited for 10 minutes or so for our table which was not a problem since you can kill time by looking around at their wine selection. We got seated and I was NOT happy with our table. It was small  and not to mention the farthest table from the lake on the patio. I had a view but my boyfriend didn't have any. UGH. Then looking at my menu I realized they gave me a brunch menu.. no one came to greet us or even fill our water glasses for 10 minutes. At this point I just wanted to leave... but my boyfriend was getting hungry and said we should just wait it out. Someone finally brought us water.. I asked the guy for a dinner menu and he never brought me one.. Then 15 minutes into us being seated I see 2 tables right by the lake finish and leave. If the hostess knew what the hell she was doing she would have had us wait at the bar so we could have been seated at the table I requested. But what ever.. at this point I just needed some wine badly. Finally our server came and took our orders. Apparently she had been there since noon which I had heard some other servers say too. So they are understaffed and most of their servers are tired. Our server was nice but half way through the meal I stopped seeing her so I'm assuming she left for the night... would have been nice if she told us she was leaving. The food was just OK here.. not bad but not amazing..if this food was being served at a restaurant that didn't have a view of a lake then I'm sure it wouldn't be doing as well. We ordered:-Bacchus Cheese & Charcuterie platter ($21) When the food runner dropped this off she started to tell us what was on it and then she stopped and said she forgot.. LOL wow it would have been nice to know what the hell we were eating but oh well.. It was nice to graze on with our wine.-Bread: Their bread basket was just some warm sliced ciabatta bread.. -Steak Frittes ($25) Decent steak with really crispy fries..-Crispy Maple Leaf Duck Breast ($30) It was good but I would have liked a more sweet glaze to go with it.. -In House Wine: You can just select a wine from the front store and bring it to your table and the server will add it on to the bill.. They charge $10 to whatever the retail price is.. Wines start at $15 ($25 in the restaurant)-Corkage fee: If you want to bring in your own bottle of wine there is a $25 feeI find it really funny that after they brought the bill to the table and after they ran my card they asked if we wanted dessert.. LOL In the end, I had an enjoyable night because I was with the man I love and the live flamenco player was a nice touch too.. but it also could have been due to the fact that we finished 2 bottles of wine so I was feeling good. but MAN Service I think is half of the experience of dining at a restaurant and this place sucked booooty in that department. If the service was good I would give Marche Bacchus 4 stars but it was just so BAD...I really am tempted to give it another go for brunch but I don't want to have to guzzle down 2 bottles of wine again just to enjoy my meal. HOT TIP: I have none. I hope the service is better for you.I came to this beautiful restaraunt for an event being held by Angela H.  Thanks for arranging it!  Marche Bacchus is on the complete opposite side of town from where I live.  But, I didn't come because of the atmosphere.  That was a bonus.  We were seated on the patio overlooking a lake which is the center piece of this community.  I also didn't come here because of the incredible service.  Our server was Vince, he was on top of everything.  He knew when to check in on us and take care of our needs.  Again, I didn't show up because of the extensive wine selection.  Nor, was it because of the brunch.  A decent egg, bacon, sausage and toast with a garnish of broiled tomatoes; is what I ordered.  The sausage was the star on the plate.  The reason I came was because of the people that I am becoming friends with.  They are worth the drive and everything else was just icing on the cake.  There were 20 of us and it was great building some new friendships.I've been wanting to come to Marche' for a long, long time. You won't ever run into this restaurant unless you go into the Desert Shores housing community so it's a hidden gem that some people may not even know is there. I did, because I tried unsuccessfully to buy a house here and got outbid at every corner.Angela H. put on a Sunday brunch UYE and we had prime patio seating for it. If it's nice out - take advantage of it! It's a shaded patio over looking the lake and has vines and potted plants giving a feel of being in someones lovely yard. It was busy, but not crowded in feeling and was a pleasant vibe for all of us to converse. I came late, but they were able to get my food out to me in a jiffy and our server was very pleasant. I had the buckwheat crepes with mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was pleasant and creamy and had to be sopped up with some bread, chicken was cooked right and I like the mushrooms were a mix of beech and oyster. The salad with it was a nice mix of greens with a hint of orange in the vinaigrette. I don't know why I haven't gone here sooner, but probably because my ego is bruised that I don't get to walk her from my backyard to brunch at the lake. I most definitely will be back as it's prime outdoor dining weather and the food was solid. I will be back for their weekday lunch special pre fixe as that seems like a great deal!There are several things I understand about dining out Mother's Day. Things are going to go wrong, be slow, and kitchens will crash and burn. I know this because I was the General Manager for 2 P.F. Chang's in town. I woke up every Mother's Day morning residing the fact that I will have to do some apologizing that day and I will do my best to address every issue and put out every fire. I will comp what I need to, and beg for forgiveness when someone's experience is ruined. My biggest complaint here is that at no time did any manger stop by to check on us. We sent back ice cold dishes, ticket times were absurd (2:15 dining time with kids) and a kid entrée brought out 20 minutes before anyone else got served (we did not request that). We had to get our desserts to go and left a 10% tip! With all of these GLARING RED FLAGS to management, not a single person stopped by to say anything, let alone apologize.  Once again, yes things will go wrong and yes management actually has the power and the obligation to recover the guest.  At what point does the manager at this restaurant step in? What other signs do they need? I will never ever be back on principal alone. Yes, the wine prices, food, and view are lovely, but not worth the incompetence of the management. Good Luck, you are going to need it. Brien McEahernWORST SERVICE EVERI hate giving bad reviews but there is no excuse for my experience. We came here for Mother's Day. Had a reservation set but didn't manage to be seated for over 30 minutes after our reserved time. Once we were seated we didn't see our server for over 10 minutes- this means we didn't even have water to sip on while we waited. Once we were given our water and menus- we didn't even have the chance to order for another 15-20 min as our server disappeared again. Long story short we finally ordered our food (took another hour or so before we received it), and they brought me the wrong thing. They "quickly" fixed it and got me the correct food. It was mediocre (at most) and I didn't even finish it. It looked/tasted like they gave me a dried out hamburger bun by wonder bread (you know... Hostess brand). When we got the bill they charged us for the incorrect order and we had to point it out to them. In all fairness they tried to right the wrong and took my item off as well as their required 18% gratuity. But even with the comp'd food, our bill was still over $200. Their desserts were amazing BUT definitely not worth $200 for a chocolate crunch. The entire dinner was 3 hours long. And it wasn't long because we finished eating and decided to talk. We were WANTING to leave but we hadn't even received out meal yet. Btw it wasn't that busy so I can't says "well it was a holiday and they were busy".  This place needs to get its act together as I've seen places like Olive Garden that are more organized and efficient than this place. And I refuse to eat at Olive Garden. I will NEVER return to this place. I wish the business best of luck and hope they learn from this experience so they may be better for the next customer who decides to eat here.Delicious food. Horrible service!! We arrived for our reservation at 1030 and were seated. They brought us water and took our drink orders. Drinks came and we didn't see anyone for 40 minutes! We had to go ask someone to come over to take our order. They didn't have someone over to take our order for another 15 minutes. Finally they took our order and it came out 20 minutes later. We asked for separate checks up front so there wouldn't be any confusion. Food on a Sunday brunch was delicious! I would go back for brunch anytime if the service wasn't so horrible! Halfway though our meal we asked for the check knowing it would take forever. It took them literally 45 minutes from the time our meals were cleared until our checks came. They told us they don't know how to do separate checks is why it is taking so long. Somehow they did it and everyone blamed it on everyone else. The manager blamed it on a slow computer and slow staff.Yikes. After quite a nice meal here two years ago, I organized a brunch for my mommy group and the service was really pretty bad:/We had a reservation for a party of 8 and after being sat waited 45 minutes to order, then subsequently had to wait and wait and wait each time we asked for so much as a refill on water. Twice a porter came to refill waters and then walked off with several of the glasses still empty- never to return with more water! We asked for our checks in the middle of the meal because we could foresee it being a looooooong wait, and unfortunately we were right.When the manager came over to ask how everything was, my friend mentioned that the service was really, really slow. He seemed surprised and eventually told us that it was because we needed separate checks. When we (nicely!) let him know that every aspect of the service had been slow, not just the check-getting portion, he mentioned the separate checks again and blamed our wait on an outdated computer system. When he came back 15 minutes later to find us still waiting he told us he had comped our bottomless mimosas due to the wait - which was nice of him! Only...none of us had had bottomless mimosas ($20), although 4 of the 8 had had single mimosas ($8). We all said thank goodness that we had ordered the singles, because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for a refill on the bottomless ones. I do understand that separate checks are not ideal (when I organize a group outing elsewhere in the future I will definitely remind everyone about bringing cash) but they can't treat separate checks like some sort of puzzling phenomenon that has never been encountered before. And the separate check situation just doesn't excuse the long waits and poor service in every other regard.Happy Father's Day 2013!!!The gurlpren took me here for Father's Day and I admit, I would have never found this place because it's located smack in the middle of a residential area.  We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view. As for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. This was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!  Steak & Eggs:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQFrench Onion Soup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YnmW7qmYq_QgVaAjqr99_A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQMache Bacchus is amazing.  Entering thru a fine wine shop, you can pick up something reasonably price.  Then, proceed to your table.On the outdoor deck, you'll be treated to live music, and a spectacular view of the lake.  Although man made, you would never know.  Alas, I became fooled many of time.This is particular a good choice for a romantic evening, or comfortable and nice enough for a group of friends for an afternoon.  Delightful.I recommend the Steak Frites ($25), Moules Mariniere (mussels, $19), and the Roasted Chicken ($22).Wonderful, wonderful place.  Also, it is miles from the strip, and provides ample parking.I have been a patron of Marche' Bacchus for many, many years. I raved to my dear friend about the wonderful food, service and ambiance the restaurant had to offer and chose it especially for her birthday luncheon celebration. Geesh, was I let down and embarrassed.We started with a five minute wait at the door while the hostess leisurely rang someone up. She finally finished, acknowledged us and seated us outside in a corner, even though there were plenty of lakeside tables available. Not to start out on the wrong foot, we accepted the lackluster table and gazed through the cloudy, plastic, weather-tarp in front of us. I watched the Manager tip a heat lamp around for a while in an attempt to fix or light it.After ten minutes of being completely unacknowledged, the waiter finally came over and gave us water. Sunny Sunday brunch-server personality? Nope. Seemed tired and unmotivated to be there. I have seriously received better service at Macaroni Grill. Isn't part of the dinning experience and higher prices great service? Not this day.We ordered a cheese platter and waited 20 minutes for it to arrive. Luckily the busboy brought bread and butter and we snacked on that instead. It was fresh and very good. The cheeses were tasty, but the sampling was super-skimpy for the price. Since it took another 30 minutes to get our entrees (which were only salads), we ate the bread and asked TWICE for more (or a cracker) so we could pare it with the cheeses. Unfortunately, neither arrived.The most annoying part of the meal was the mimosas order. We each ordered one and received them promptly. We finished them before our cheese chunks were gobbled down, so we decided to order another to help us cope with the humor of being ignored. The server filled our half-empty glasses and took off. We assumed the OJ would be coming right behind him, but nope. Straight champagne for us. When I got the bill, I was horrified to see that the Sunday Brunch mimosas were endless. We each only got a glass and a half and were charged $40! I'm pretty upset about that.MB used to be so delicious and set a certain standard for locals who know where to go to find the "good" restaurants. New owner? New manager? Not sure what happened, but I seriously felt robbed when I left the restaurant. I would have talked to the manager, but I was so frustrated by the time we left, I decided it would just be better to bite the bullet. So disappointed!!!!!Stopped in for lunch on a gorgeous day so we sat outside in the patio area overlooking the lake. You'll see swans, turtles, and ducks in the lake if you come during the day. Makes you feel like you've just escaped Vegas for a second. The restaurant  has an impressive selection of wines that you can choose from. The food was fantastic. We had the beef carpaccio which was tender and very flavorful. The Escargot... only because we felt like it was the "french" entree to order..no regrets! The steak tartar was also very good but nothing special. For dessert, we had the bread pudding and beignets. Both delicious but the bread pudding definitely out-shined the beignets. The ambiance is surreal...very romantic. Overall I could not have asked for a more enjoyable lunch. Great food, lakeside seating, and classical french music playing. I can't wait to come back.I was shocked to find out I have not reviewed Marche Bacchus prior.  I have been a regular here for years and guess I have always forgotten to submit a review. Having said that, it is well over due and deserving of my reserved 5 Star rating.  The service, scenery and setting is deserving of 4 stars alone, but the food pushes it on to 5 stars.My most recent visit was just for a quick lunch, but we enjoyed ourselves so much we ended up spending a few hours just enjoying the scenery and ambiance.  The staff is very friendly and efficient without being over bearing and ever present.  I haven't tried everything on the menu as of yet, but everything I have tried has more than satisfied.If you are looking for a quiet place for lunch, or a romantic setting for dinner you can't miss with Marche Bacchus.This is one of my favorite restaurants in Summerlin. I first went here about 3 years ago for restaurant week right after I moved to Las Vegas and it has been a staple ever since.First, the atmosphere/ambiance at this restaurant is totally different from most other places in the area. Summerlin is a planned community and as such it follows the same pattern as every other suburb on the planet- every 6 blocks there is a strip mall with a Best Buy and a Chilis. Most restaurants are chains and look exactly the same as every other restaurant in the country. Not so Marche Bacchus- it is an incredible place with an awesome view of the lake. It is an excellent place to take your special lady friend or anyone else you want to impress with your faux sophistication (second best place- Buffalo Wild Wings). Second, I have always found the service to be exceptional. The staff strike the perfect middle ground between ignoring you and being overly needy/explaining a million things you didn't ask about. Notes on specific dishesFrench Onion Soup- not exactly rocket science to prepare, but that doesn't stop the Outbacks of the world from ruining a classic. This is great- very rich and no unnecessary flavorsSteak tartare- something you can pretty much get anywhere now a days but few are as goodCreamy Polenta- I love polenta so this is something I get frequently. The mushrooms make it less of a one note side dish and more of an appetizer. Veal- my absolute favorite. It always comes so tender and perfectly seasoned.Beef Tenderloin- the red wine sauce on this is amazing. I'm not usually a beef tenderloin person but I love this.C'est magnifique! I was really blown away by the food at Marché Bacchus!  I'm mad at myself that it took me so long to go and try this place out.  So many missed meals are running through my head right now.  Here were the highlights:1. The food was amazing and easily 5 stars!  We tried a lot of things and everything we ordered was super tasty and tummy pleasing!  The meal started for both us us with French Onion Soup.  We each got our own because my hubby knows I don't share French Onion Soup with anyone!  The soup was fantastic! It is easily in my top 5 of all time.  This is saying a lot because I have been to France and ate a lot of French Onion soup while visiting.My hubby had the wine braised beef and it was really very good.  A knife wasn't even needed to cut the meat because it would just fall apart on it's own.  It was packed with flavor and really was yum-tastic.  I went with the classic Steak Frites, because it is really one of my go to entrees.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was served with a delicious herb butter that was melting all over it.  The frites or french fries were some of the best I have ever eaten in my life, and i know a thing or two about french fries! To top it off, it came with the most fabulous Béarnaise I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  If it wasn't such a nice spot, I might have licked the ramakin clean because it was that yummy! My hubby got Tiramisu for dessert.  I'm not a Tiramisu fan, so I can't say much about it, however the hubs said it was delightful!2. The atmosphere is beautiful.  The restaurant is set right on one of the lakes in Desert Shores.  You can't beat waterfront dining, especially in the middle of the desert.  I almost forgot that we were in Las Vegas, which makes for a great evening out.  Great great great location!3. The staff was all very friendly.  Everyone we encountered was smiling, happy, friendly, and helpful.  Yay for happy people!So with all of this good stuff, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  There were a couple of snafus that made them lose a star.  Here they are:1. We made reservations ahead of time.  I had mentioned it was our anniversary and we would like nice table.  When we got there, the hostess made a big deal of only having one table left and having to squeeze us in.  The table we got was up against the wall.  The floor around us had some broken glass as well.  It seems to have been missed during a clean up effort, but we could easily see it.  There was also several tables wide open for the entire time we were there right next to the water.  I guess we weren't special enough for those seats.2. The servers were all super nice, but stretched thin.  When we had our server, she was awesome.  The problem was we had to wait long periods in-between visits because she was so busy.  I don't mind a leisurely dinner, but this was a bit extreme.  Luckily we had made over night babysitting arrangements, otherwise we would have had to leave well before we were done with dinner.So the food is awesome, the locale is beautiful, and it is a great place for a nice night out, just make sure you booked your babysitter for an extra hour or 2.I Hate long reviews, but I wanted to share my most recent experience here:Went to have lunch last Saturday and BOY what a waste of time and money. I've been coming here for years and I know that it is a hit or miss most of the time. It was packed, which is fine, they were setting up for large parties, but we were severely neglected (even though we were one of like 7 tables seated). Our server looked like she was having the WORST day of her life, and I don't resent her for it, who know what's what. We ordered Bloody Marys, which were basically shrimp cocktail sauce in a glass. I get using some horseradish in the mix, but the consistency and the flavor intensity was just straight up cocktail sauce. So disappointing because my man and I came a little hungover and were really looking forward to it. My pet peeve in restaurants is when stuff is sent out without anyone checking the food or doing a drink taste test. UGH!!! I had a french onion soup. It came with a large crouton with cheese on top of it. It was extremely inconvenient to eat, I was struggling with that big chunk of bread, glued to the cheese for a while. Tasty though. I'd really recommend dropping a piece of toasted bread in the soup and baking the cheese over the bowl, it's what French Onion Soup is ALL about, the cheese factor! I mean Google the thing for F sake and you will see many amazing ways of presenting this awesome dish! The bf had a blue cheese burger. He eats red meat like once in a year and was looking forward to it. Medium rare.... came out well done, extra dry and there was a very conservative drop of blue cheese on there. Meh. I had a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. First bite was like biting into smelly fish. The turkey was completely spoiled. I thought it was just me (because of the night before), the bf did a taste test and we sent it back. There was no significant reaction from the server, like AT ALL. And 20 min later she comes by and says "I'll take that off the bill for ya okaaay?" Like she was doing us a favor. We both looked at her and said "uhh... yeah, you will!" We noticed other patrons sending food back and the owner did absolutely nothing about coming over and talking to the guests or making apologies. Every time I see him, he just strikes me as a huge huge douche. And knowing this place (and many people who have worked here) he is and so is his wife. No wonder there is no enthusiasm in this place and why their employee turnover is so high. Shame.Do yourself a favor, skip lunch and have a dinner here. Service will always be total sh*t, but it's great atmosphere for you and your love and if you stick to perhaps the cheese plate, the muscles and other simpler items, you will not be disappointed.Let me first start out with my gripe and get it off my chest so I can move on with my life (just kidding, kinda). So I made reservations about 6 weeks prior to Bastille Day, for brunch, we had a group of 10, so I wanted to make sure I gave plenty of notice (I'm a planner). I arrive the day of, led out to the patio area, and the hostess says, I'm so sorry, I thought we had the table ready. So I'm led to another area of the patio and seated. It's July 11, and when I made the reservation, I wasn't anticipating sitting outside, so I didn't bother requesting inside. I see there are quite a few people outside, and they had fans going, so I decided to toughen up and enjoy it (I love outside dining, just not when it's 108 degrees out). As we are sitting there, the misters would shoot on for 2 seconds and shut off, I asked our waitress if there was any way they could leave them on, she said they "were working on it". As the table is sitting there, all of us are dressed up, we are all dripping with sweat and having a hard time enjoying ourselves. As we are leaving, the hostess apologizes for the heat and asked us "did your waitress tell you what happened" we said no, she said a customer had decided to try and redirect one of the misters directly on him and it broke the entire system, the hostess then followed it up with "your waitress should've offered to move you girls inside". Little late now. Also, I had a restaurant.com voucher that I attempted to use, if anyone is familiar with those, they are very specific on the voucher about day, times, etc about when you can use them. My voucher only stated not valid on alcohol. So, they would not accept my voucher because they said their system is only set up to accept the vouchers for dinner (does not state this anywhere) the mgr claimed he has been meaning to contact them to correct it. That's my rant. The food. Our brunch was amazing. Every single dish. A few stand outs were, French Toast, Lobster Salad Croissant and of course the Croque Madame. The Creme Brûlée was delicious, I attempted to get the bread pudding, but they were out of vanilla ice cream, and the waitress tried talking me into subbing mango ice cream instead, which sounded terrible together. I enjoyed my food enough to overlook the service issues we had and to come back and dine again.Shame on me for not reviewing MB yet!This gem is on the water (yes, a an actual, albiet man-made, water-way in Las Vegas) in Summerlin. Be sure to sit on the patio and be ready to feel as if you aren't in our beautiful desert climate. On your way out you can peruse their wine shop and pick out a bottle to accompany dinner. I like my bubbles, so insisted on champagne and a bottle of white.I wasn't as impressed with the live music/entertainment as some other Yelpers. I think live music is very important to ambiance but my preference would have been a talent like Daniel Park or perhaps a straight acoustics musician. The man there this was a bit off his game (maybe he was sick?)Anyway, on to the food! We ordered:French Onion SoupDuck Confit Salad (Favorite!)ParpadalleWhite fish (special du jour)There is no question that I will be back soon. MB is a nice alternative to the glitz of dinner out on the Strip.
Jimmy John's=Jimmy John's....why did it take so long for me to find you?  I've heard so much about this place and for some reason have never eaten at one of there joints until the other day.After browsing the menu, I opted for a #5 Vito Italian Sandwich (Genoa Salami, Provolone, Capicola, Onion, Lettuce, Tomato & Italian Vinaigrette) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips & Soda.....another Soda Fountain got to me....they have Mello Yello Soda here....never tried it before, so I had to give it a shot.The Sandwich was made really fast, they handed me the Sandwich while I was paying for the food....wow!  I anxiously unwrapped the Sandwich and was pleased to see a large Sandwich.  As soon as I took the first bite, I became an instant fan.  The Italian Bread was soft and was definitely the highlight of the Sandwich.  The Meats and toppings were very good too, but the Bread made this Sandwich special.  It was doughy and went well with the Meat, Italian Vinaigrette and Veggies.....it some ways it reminded me of the Subs/Grinders I've had on the East Coast.Will I return?  You can count on it!Have been here at least 5 times since my last review.  Since then I've discovered the #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinagrette, $5.75) and add Hot Peppers $.25.I can't get over how fast they make Sandwiches here....seriously, it takes them like 1 to 2 minutes max.  The Italian Club Sandwich has become my new favorite......it's full of flavor and filling.  I love the Hot Peppers....wish I could buy them at the store to take home.  The proportion of meat, cheese, and ingredients is perfect.  This is becoming one of my favorite Sandwich joints.Return Factor - 90%If you want a sandwich that'll make your blood pressure go up, this is the place for you. This is the location close to my office and so if I want something quick without having to drive, I end up giving them a call. For the past few years, they've been good at making my blood boil...and I keep giving them a chance. "Jimmy will change"...NO! Keep dreaming!Ordering on the phone is quite painful as their order takers can't hear. "It's too loud in the store" yet I don't hear background noise. Investing in a good phone might help. When they write your credit card number/ name/  address/ phone number - they can never get it right. "We tried calling you multiple times because your credit card won't go through." It helps if you call the right number and most credit cards have 16 digits. This leads to not having a receipt for you.There were times I had to wait a long time for a delivery when it's only a 2-minute drive away. "The driver got lost"...really? GPS for less than half a mile?However, I do like their sandwiches better than say Quizno's or Subway. I normally get: Bootlegger's Club, Hunter's Club, Turkey Tom. You have the option to just have the meat and bread (Slims) or not have the bread at all (Unwich).Yes.  Quality and Clean.  JJ's trumps Subway for sure.  This location is perfect if you're at work, at school or a hospital near by.  Good prices and from what I understand they have delivery that's freakishly fast.  Good food in a pinch.
Old Town Sarajevo=It seems as though good sausage is a way to my heart...or so my doctor tells me. But enough about me, this is all about a fantastic Phoenix gem that I would have never known of had it not popped up on my Yelp app one Sunday afternoon; this is about Caffe Sarajevo.This Bosnian dive is home to a seemingly authentic menu, and an atmosphere that made me feel like I left Phoenix for lunch. As with any ethnic dive, I expected service to be absolute crap or absolute gold...the service I got was gold! I walked in with the girlfriend into a small dining area filled with customers speaking words that I couldn't understand while laughing and having a great time enjoying their food and company. We were immediately greeted and asked to sit wherever we'd like by a server who was smiling and very welcoming. After we sat down, he came over and was awesome enough to go over most of the menu with us, explaining each of his favorite things in perfect detail. - If you know me, you know I like dives... Also, if you know me, you know I love asking for recommendations, and love hearing those recommendations with enthusiasm. -  I was in heaven, and completely excited when we decided on the Cevapi (the sausage sandwich), the Pljeskavica (a beef patty sandwich), a Sirnica (cheese puff pastry) and some freshly made Turkish coffee...And here we go:I love coffee, especially strong, rich coffee with real flavor. Lemme tell ya, if you're looking for some good caffeinated mud, look no further. Just great. While waiting for the main dishes, we shared the Sirnica, which had just come out of the oven! It was literally a hot mess and filo doughLICIOUS! As far as those sammiches, we didn't want to stop mowing through them! The Cevapi was served with a couple sauces and raw onion, and the sausage was a mix of lamp and cow. Mix those all together on some freshly baked Bosnian bread, and...Yum! The Pljeskavica was a patty on the same bread, but had more of a lamb flavor to me than a beef. It was also yum, especially since it was covered in cheese and mushrooms!!Holy hell, I've gone on long enough. The food was great. The service was great. The people were all great. I'm such a fan. I love dive restaurants. I love ethnic food, and now, I love Bosnian food.There's no better way to have your first Bosnian cuisine than having a true-blooded Bosnian for company. He speaks the language, ordered for us, and knows if the food is authentic and not watered-down for the American palette. WHY GO THERE? My Bosnian friend gave this restaurant the thumbs-up seal of approval. The food is  good, he had a box to go for the next day.WHATCHAGOT? For starters, we ditched the hearty soup and went for bread. We had all three pitas: meat, cheese and spinach. While each was delicious and warmed up, it would have been better to have them early in the day when they're made fresh. Traditionally, you grab the end by hand and uncoil the bread, as you work your way to the center. Best shared. The cevapi is filling. I find the large too much, I could have settled for a medium or small. I asked about the raw onions. My friend said it is a cure for everything. Have an ailment, eat the raw onion! I guess it's apples for Americans, onions for Bosnians!We wrapped dinner with an addictively sweet and delicious tulumbe. Better than baklava!YOU GOT SERVED.Service is quick and friendly, but in a take-your-time-when-you're-ready-to-order kind of way. I like it better than the methodical service of chain restaurants. Overall, the Turkish and Greek influences are very much present in Bosnian cuisine. If you like Turkish, you'd like Bosnian food. Geez, that sounds like the perfume ad of the 80's.I checked out this place for the International Supper Club UYE.  I love checking out food from around the world, in the US and in it's native land.  So, this was cool.  I've never been to Bosnia.  I wondered what the food could be like because Bosnia is a literally cultural melting pot with Mediterranean, European and Middle Eastern influences.  I was eager to give it a try and see if any of those 3 cultures dominated the influence on the food.  You might drive past the tiny shopping plaza in which this restaurant is located.  Why you ask?  Because it is about as nondescript as a traffic light, except you pay attention to the traffic light.  It's also a rather run down plaza and is not attractive.  No worries, pull in to that parking lot and yeah, you'll look around like, "where is Ursula sending me.....?????"  Seriously, go inside.  You'll quickly realize that you've escaped the ho' hum and entered eastern Europe.   The inside of that restaurant is so neatly decorated, you feel like you're in eastern Europe.  Fortunately, I was with a great group of yelpers.  I teamed up with Preston S to split our entrees.  He ordered the Pljeskavica and I ordered the Cevapi.  Both of these items are served on the tastiest, flakiest, buttery pastry type bread I've had in quite some time.  The Pljeskavica was a 4-star item with a the beef patty, mushrooms and cheese on that flaky pastry-like bun.  I would order this item again!  The Cevapi was somewhat like a kabob, but really reminded me of Jimmy Dean Breakfast sausages in appearance.  But NOT in taste.  These small sausages are made of beef and lamb and are seasoned with Bosnian spices.  This was a 3-star item for me.  If I ever get back over there, I MUST try the burek.   I have a feeling that I will enjoy that immensely!  Unfortunately, any place that serves dinner, but not wine generally gets a one-star-off from me.  This could have been a 4-star review from me!  I wonder if you can do a BYOB.  I have to keep in mind that no booze could be a religious choice as well.  so I'm giving them a 3.5 instead of taking the whole 1 star.  I always bump 3.5 star reviews to 4 stars.This place is like getting in a time machine and going back in history. Somebody has spent a great amount of energy decorating the inside of this place like an old fashion Bosnian town. Tons of intricate wood work and detail to add just that right amount of fun and authenticity.Came here after seeing the International Supper Club pig out at one of their UYE parties. They always pick great places and food that is unique and tasty. I can confirm all of the above with a smile.The menu here is rather small but filled with several different types of Bossian specialties. Usually get one of the Cevapi/Bosnian Sausage Sandwiches. There are three different sizes depending on how hungry you at the moment. Also have tried the tasty Pljeskavica/Beef Patty with mushrooms and cheese.Service is friendly and helpful. On my first visit the owner and server were getting ready to eat lunch. They were more than happy to share some of the treats that they were having with me. She said it was a potato version of the cheese pita that they make. Nice!You know it is good when you can hear people speaking a language that you are not accustom to hearing. Sometimes they can get a little loud and passionate in their discussions. Gives you that intimate feeling like you are there with them and in the zone. Overall the food is very good and worth checking out. There are several other dishes that I want to try on my next visit. Still need to also check out the desserts. Good thing my job has me in the area a couple times a month. Meet me for lunch if you can. CHEERS!4.25 STARS
Carrabba's=Carrabba's just flat out sucks.  Growing up north next to all good italian food, there were times where I will still stop in Carraba's.  It always felt like a step above chain restaurants and the food seemed to almost be on the level of a cheesecake factory.  Not so much anymore.  I rather go to Chile's than eat this mess again.  We started with the mixto appetizer ( i know that is not the name ) with the calamari, bruschetta, and mozzie stix.  This was the only thing decent other than the 1 Beer and 1 wine we had.  For the entrees we had the frozen lobster ravioli and the filet covered in goat cheese.  There was more goat cheese than steak and the steak was pretty rare.  Normally I would be all about this, but for such a shitty cut of meat the only thing saving this thing was the goat cheese.  When i recieved my bill for $93 after feeling like my food was  a step below applebee's I wish i had gone somewhere else like Mama Ricottas where I would get 100xs better food and even at a cheaper rate.  Carrabba's what happened to you?  I used to love you and now I know to just 500 ft away like I have a restraining order against you.
Kabul Restaurant=I'm so glad Kabul is back, and, from the large crowd present during a recent visit, the rest of Madison is as well. The new space is nice, with a large bar in the middle and a lot of seating. It's unfortunate it cannot be on the street level where it would be more visible, but I hope the great reputation and following keep it busy.The food is as wonderful as always, Middle Eastern with a unique Afghan twist. We have loved this staple of Madison for years and were saddened when they were temporarily closed for a forced relocation when their building was torn down. One of the things we love most about the Madison food scene is the ability to find tastes from around the globe. Chinese, Thai, Greek and other unique flavors can be found in most mid to large cities, but Afghan food is something more difficult to find. Plus, they are often open on Christmas and other holidays, which makes it a great place to visit when no one else is open.Portions are generous, seasonings are to perfection. I feel like I'm eating healthy when I dine here since someone actually makes the food from scratch rather than buying pre-made versions from a wholesaler. I'm a big fan and look forward to returning.
Buffet @ Asia=During numerous trips to Vegas, I've frequented the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow Blvd. (My review of that place here: (http://www.yelp.com/biz/buffet-at-asia-las-vegas-4#hrid:mSPf88mhq76t49Qo-3jtlw). In the sea of Vegas buffets, Buffet at Asia is one of the best ones in my opinion for Asian food. On my latest Vegas trip however, I got to try for the first time to the Buffet at Asia in the Henderson area.The setup of this Buffet at Asia is a little bit different from the one on the westside. This one has one long row of food items that starts with a Mongolian wok type cookery. Next up is their sushi items and then this is followed by the soups: wonton, miso and seafood soup. Up next is the traditional Asian buffet food: they have good offerings like egg rolls, egg foo young, orange chicken, chicken skewers, dumplings and veggie tempura. Off to the side is their desserts: some items are orange jello, almond jello, chocolate mousse, frozen yogurt and sesame balls. I like how above the food items are big, bright lights and letters showing the name of the different areas. So very Vegas picturesque ;)They do offer some food that the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow doesn't have. It was the first time I saw these chicken with cheese wontons that I really liked. I did think however that the selection over at the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow is larger. This branch at Henderson had good food offerings but not as many as the westside location. Nevertheless, the food here is a good and if in you are in Henderson, it's a good place to go to. It's less than $10 and includes a drink!DO NOT COME HERE! I don't know what sucks more: their non existent service or their food. The food:Let's start off with the best thing there: honeydew. I should have just ate honeydew the whole time because everything else sucked. Don't even bother getting their sushi....it's just California roll with sauce on top or presented differently. Their seafood soup or whatever tasted very fishy. The pineapples looked like they had been sitting out for too long. Idk the food was just a huge mess. I felt like I only ate their veggie tempura, baked sweet potato and honey dew the whole time because everything else sucked. And as for the veggie tempura, it wasn't even good, but it was one of the better food options. Thank god they didn't fail on baking the sweet potato or else idk how and why they are still open. The service:We asked for napkins like literally 5 times and the waitresses had attitude. We also asked for hot tea and they put the hot tea in a plastic cup. Wait hold up? Have these waitresses not gone thru some type of food handlers training? Even if they didn't, do they not have common sense? Because you know it's common sense to not put hot drinks in plastic cups. Omg. They need to throw these waitresses back into kindergarten cus clearly they hired dumbasses. They also don't know how to own a business because the customer should always be right. We asked for the hot tea to be poured into a mug, but the waitress said the mug is for coffee only. Like wtf?! Are you stupid? Sigh.The city/county health inspector really should visit this place!$15 bucks a person for this slop is an outrage! Took my teen son here tonight as we were both hungry, both enjoy Chinese food and didn't feel like cooking...what a mistake to dine here!The restaurant is dirty...floors look they haven't been mopped in weeks, the ceiling fans I saw had dust attached to them ready to fly into somebody's food, the men's restroom mirror was filthy and out of hand soap.The food was plentiful...however most of it looked and tasted dried out because it was sitting so long and/or soggy because it was sitting so long it clumped together in a mush. The chunks of beef had a spoiled taste to it, despite it being cooked. It's as if it was old meat that was starting to smell/rot because of spoilage and they cooked it last minute to try and push it off on customers. It was titled "steak."The ribs were undercooked. The orange chicken was clumped together like a mush. The mushrooms were so soft it was like drinking mushroom soup instead of the nice crunch. same thing with the string beans, mushy and no crunch. The sushi area and desserts area should've been roped off with yellow caution tape!The utensils on our table had to be sent back as they had food crusted on them, despite them being wrapped in a napkin as if they were clean and ready for use. Noticed severs wiping tables with a washrag that was first used to wipe the booth seats...do they not understand the concept of cross contamination?The restaurant was so warm inside I was sweating, while wearing a pair of shorts and tshirt. See my photos of the thermostat....86 F inside, really? It was so uncomfortably hot in there that I left hungry just to escape to cool off in my air conditioned car.  but before we made it to the front door, we saw a TV/computer monitor by the front door showing over 20 mini screens of the surveillance cameras (eye in the sky) that appear just about everywhere on the ceilings throughout. What are they in fear of...somebody is going to steal their fortune cookies or chopsticks? My suggestion is to trade in the fancy surveillance cameras as nobody wants your umteen bags of white rice and invest in air conditioning and education on cleanliness. One star is a gift for the nice lady who earned herself a $2 dollar tip for filling our sodas twice.
How Lee Chinese Food=My roommate has been trying to make me go here for the longest time swearing by their food. I don't know what took me so long, but I believe that this is the best Szechuan restaurant in the greater Pittsburgh area. I went with my boyfriend to top off a rather exhausting day. We ordered spicy beef tendon, Chongqing lazi chicken, and spicy eggplant and garlic. I don't even know why we ordered that much food because in all honesty we weren't that hungry. Keeping this in mind, once our food came out we devoured all of it. It did take a few hours but we did it. Perhaps the only thing I would change would be the amount of sauce that covered the eggplants, the eggplants were practically submerged. I usually like my eggplant with a lighter amount of sauce. The place was a bit pricier but the portions made up for it- the chef covered the whole surface of the plate. The service wasn't the greatest, but they were nice enough.I was bummed out from the very start of this meal.  I went to dine at How Lee's around 12:30pm and to my dismay they were only serving the lunch menu.  I ordered the shrimp and scallops which was served with a soup I choose the wanton soup.  My shrimp and scallops came out a little too fast like no sooner had my choice left my lips did the food arrive at my table.  There were literally only 3 other patrons in the restaurant and I don't know why the chef felt the need to nook my food.  I can get better tasting and more freshly prepared Chinese food from China Taste on East Ohio Street. My star rating can potentially go higher after I have had an opportunity to sample How Lee's dinner menu.This is one of my fav Chinese takeout joints in the 'Burgh. Don't judge, but I'm an Americanized Chinese kinda gal. This place also has an authentic Sichuan menu along with their Americanized menu. I'd really like to try some authentic food, but I'm so freaking addicted to their General Tso's chicken that when it comes time to order, I often can't resist the lure of my ol' reliable. Oh General Tso's, why can't I quit you? Crispy breaded chicken, tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy sauce, a couple of pieces of fresh broccoli thrown in for good measure...General Tso's, you please me so.I've also had a few other standard "Ameri-Chinese" things from their menu (egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, broccoli with brown sauce, lo mein, orange chicken, etc. etc.), and all are quite tasty and what you would expect from a quality Chinese takeout place. I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore, but when I did, their delivery speed was always stellar. Now I do mostly takeout, and even during their busiest times, they always have my order ready when they say they will.Bonus points: They let you sub brown rice for white for a small upcharge, which helps trick me into thinking that my meal is not going straight into my arteries (but who are we kidding, it totally is).Someday I hope to try to some of their more authentic offerings if I can break free from the grip of General Tso.
Sultan's Grill=I truly hate to give a bad review to a neighborhood place that I've been to many times before.  But tonight's dinner was unbearable.We usually order kebab - chicken for my husband, and kafta or chicken for me.  But tonight we decided to shake things up, and the coupon did us in.  There was one from one of the mailers offering two dinners for $14.95.  Kebabs wasn't one of the choices, but Chicken Shawarma was.  How different could it be from Chicken Kebab, which we've always liked???Step 1:  Call to order for take-out.  Kid on the other end: "I'm not sure we have enough rice left for two dinners."  It's 8:15; they close, I think, at 10.  Puts me on hold for quite a while.  Finally:  "Yes, we do."  So I order them, with one vinaigrette and one creamy for the salad dressings.  Five minutes and it'll be ready.  No prob, we live close by.Hubby's sick, so I pick up the food.  Back home, I open my container to see the usual yellow rice, pickled cabbage and turnips, chopped raw red onion, the usual hard, dried-out pita, and a whole mess of dried and shriveled chicken pieces.  I taste one of them;  first I choked on the dryness, then my mouth shriveled from the salt - so much of it that two pieces and my lips were stinging as if I were doing a dead man's float in the Dead Sea.  It was completely inedible.It was when I noticed that the salads - fresh romaine, two slices of cuke, and one lonely grape tomato - came with not one, but two vinaigrettes.  No creamy for me.  I was then completely pissed and called the restaurant.  Got the same kid who'd taken my order, and asked to speak with the manager.I was put on hold twice - the second time for a verrrryyyy long time.  How big is this tiny place that he can't find the manager??  Finally the clerk gets back on to tell me that the manager isn't there, and he doesn't have the authority to issue any refunds.  But the manager will call me later this evening, if not, then tomorrow.  He didn't call tonight, so I'm waiting until late tomorrow afternoon to post this review.  I suspect that I will have waited for nothing.Well, I was right to wait.  I never heard from Sultan's Grill.  I had planned to give this meal two stars, because I do like the chopped veggies and the salad (when I have the dressing I ordered).  But I believe that a food business shouldn't be in the business of selling inedible food, and if they do, they have a duty to respond to complaints.  I'm not even asking for a free meal, just an acknowledgment that they dropped the ball.  A business that does not do this doesn't deserve any stars, so I've revised my rating downward.
Michael's Pizza Bar & Restaurant=This is a review I didn't ever want to write.  This place is just too good. You know, pizza is something we all have a standard against which all others are measured. And the search for that perfect pizza is much like the search for the fountain of youth - elusive but clearly worthwhile. Michael's has restored my faith that perhaps that fountain of youth does exist - the perfect pizza certainly does! And Michael's has it! Sure, there's good pizza all over the place. But there's only one BEST pizza. I've had pizza all over Pittsburgh, all over the US (NYC, Chicago, SoCal...) and all over Europe including Italy. I've had Monte Cello's VIncent's, Domenico's, Luciano's, Mineo's, and all the chains - although I do like Piccolo Forno's too. My search has not been half-hearted nor without focus. I stumbled upon Michaels about 8 years ago and hit the motherlode. When I want pizza, I'm willing to drive the 25 miles from the north hills to the south side just to sit and enjoy my favorite pizza with a pitcher of Yuengling in a comfy bar atmosphere.I wanted to keep this place to myself, not to tell anyone about it. After all, hidden gems are meant to remain hidden, right? Otherwise people swarm in and spoil a good thing. No one wants to go somewhere where everyone goes!! But alas, I find myself after 8 years of going here as a regular, finally wanting to shout it out!! THIS IS GREAT PIZZA!!! Two blocks off Carson street on Sarah, it's off the beaten path and is not a place you're likely to just happen upon. You have to look for it. But once you do, you'll be hooked. First off, the crust is perfect, not too thin, not thick and doughy. It's a delight. The sauce is what make it. One thing I know it's sauce. And this is remarkable. Order the twisty's as an appetizer - parmesan dusted baked dough twists that are to die for - and you'll get a side of the sauce. Go ahead, dip in. You'll thank me. I could eat a bowl of that sauce with a tablespoon. And ask for more. This pizza just kills!! And if Meghan is working there, you'll be treated to the best service with a smile. She is absolutely the best. Good pizza, good service, good beer, good atmosphere. I call that JACKPOT!! What more could you want? If I have to wait for a table next time, I'll know I should have kept this secret to myself!!We decided to try Michael's Pizza Bar & Restaurant one sunny Saturday this past summer.  A little off the beaten path running through the South Side you will find this little treasure.  First impressions, it's a quaint neighborhood bar.  The kind of place that if you live close you probably frequent.  I was really excited to try Michael's after hearing about their pizza. So that is where we laid our attention.We ordered a large pie half cheese (for him) and the other half mushroom, onions, and banana peppers (for me).  Now I am like every other red blooded American, but pizza doesn't usually impress me.  It's ok, great to eat with beer, but I could never eat it regularly.  When I get pizza I like it to be thin crust, crisp, almost stand on its own, with veggies.  That being said Michael's delivered not only a pretty chill atmosphere but a pretty tasty pie.  Matt really liked the crust and the sauce.  I enjoyed the flavors as well, especially since they do not skimp on the toppings at all.  There was a plethora of veggies piled atop my pie.  This was good but came with its own set of challenges as the toppings weighed the pizza down, so there went my stand on its own factor.  That was ok it was still very scrumptious.  The one thing I really wish they would have done was use fresh mushrooms and not the canned ones.   Funny thing happened as we were eating and enjoying some brews.  A couple with a few kids pulled up outside.  They left the door of their SUV open as their kids slept in the car while they had some pie at the outdoor table.  I laughed cause I would totally do the same thing.
El Pollo Loco=El Pollo Loco FREE Chicken for Mothers Day http://bit.ly/BymAs , http://bit.ly/nlKUm , http://bit.ly/nzgPuDining in at a fast food restaurant is not something I enjoy, but it I will do it from time to time when taking the food to go just won't do. This location is pretty busy and on the few occasions I have dined here, it gets loud and a little hard to hear your own thoughts, much less the conversation form your dining companion. The food is that of any other El Pollo Loco and they keep the place relatively clean with a well stocked salsa bar.
La Tavola Italiana=Oh this place!  I wanted to like it, I really did! I had heard good things from a few friends.  I also felt guilty I hadn't been there since I lived so close to it!  Me and a group of friend went there.  At the very beginning of the meal they pretty much tell you service will be VERY slow.  They weren't kidding! I assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food.  It wasn't just food we waited for though!  We waited for drinks, bread an even silverware!  The server was no where to be found at times.I would have forgiven all this if my food was amazing BUT it was far from it!  I'm very judgmental of Italian being that I am a proud Italian myself!  I ordered past vodka.  It was not the creamy delish sauce I expected, it was runny tastelessness!  My friend tried the regular spaghetti and the sauce tasted like it was from a spaghetti-o can.  Everyone agreed their meals left much to be desired.  Again, I really wanted to like this place, but after a 3 1/2 hour overpriced unappetizing meal I could no longer like the place!After a bad experience at TGI Fridays, my boyfriend and I decided to check out more local restaurants to support local business as well as open up our taste buds to things other than chain restaurants. Having family in Mt. Washington, I pass it occasionally so it's always been a place I've wanted to try. This was our first stop...The food was excellent and a great start to more of a finer dining experience. It's fancy, but not suit-and-tie fancy, so if you want to come in a nice pair of jeans and a dress shirt - you're good. The food was great! We ordered the Pasta Carmela and it was enough to take home. The garlic sauce was light yet satisfying and had a zing of spice which perfected the meal. We also were served garlic bread and a salad with a wonderful house dressing that reminded me of an Italian/Balsamic mix. Also note that the place is BYOB. Enough said... The place itself sort of crammed which was one of the only downfalls, but overall the experience was pleasant. Service is great, too. I definitely would like to come back and allow others to experience this gem.I was told this place had the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  I'm on a perpetual quest for the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  It's a noble pursuit.  Right now I believe the best Italian food is at Centro Anni Alla Famiglia.I walked into this place and thought, "people who said this was going to be amazing are damn liars!"  It was not good.  The food was like Del's, and this is not an endorsement.  If you enjoy paying a lot of money for mediocre Italian food you'll be able to tell was once frozen and likely freezer burned, this is the place for you.Maybe they were having an off day.  I hope so, because I really love good Italian food.  I was just very underwhelmed.Sorry, Olive Garden, I think when you said, 'when you're here, you're family,' you actually *meant* to say, 'when you're at La Tavola Italiana, you're family,' because seriously, that's what having dinner here is like.I want to ask, 'why haven't I been here before??' but the answer's pretty simple. This is not what you think of when you think of 'Mt. Washington Restaurants.' It's a low-key sort of place that's on a back street and you'd almost miss it if you weren't looking for it. But inside, it's like you walked into a big family dinner, and all your favorite relatives are there.When we arrived for our 8:30pm reservations, the dining room was PACKED. There were several giant parties (one of whom turned out to be host to a surprise engagement!), but we were seated right away, and from the moment our server Chris approached our table, I knew we were in for a treat.While Chris was opening our wines (oh yes, lest I forget to mention, IT'S BYOB!!) we chatted with him about our mutual love for the Food Network. This all began to make sense as soon as he described the night's specials to us. It is a wonderful thing to have a server who is passionate about the food he will be bringing you, and that's exactly what we had with Chris. He described every dish to us in detail as if he was a chef on Chopped and he had just prepared it for the judges.The decision was tough, but eventually my two dining companions and I settled on our meals. We started with an order of the antipasti - flavorful and fresh, but not so huge a portion that you spoil your appetite - and the fried zucchini. OH that fried zucchini! Crispy, savory, just lightly fried, and accompanied by a wonderful chunky marinara sauce. And at only $8.95, you can't go wrong. Promise me right now that when you come here, you will order the fried zucchini!We were having a celebratory dinner, so we were taking our time, and Chris really helped that happen. The pacing of the meal was just right: we had enough time to enjoy each course before the next arrived, and there was no pressure to choose our meals too quickly even though the restaurant was crowded.We enjoyed their crispy, buttery garlic toast alongside our house salads (excellent house Italian salad dressing!) as we waited for our entrees.Here was where the little snag came in: my girlfriends' meals came out first, and my chicken parm was nowhere in sight. Chris quickly explained that something had gotten mixed up in the kitchen and it would be just a short time. Since we were taking our time chatting and pacing out the meal, it wasn't a problem.But even though we were in no rush, Chris wasn't satisfied with our having to wait for my plate to come out separately from the others. He not only comped my meal as a courtesy, he treated all three of us to desserts on the house! I realize that mistakes happen in restaurants, especially on busy nights, and I always try to be understanding, but this extra step just meant so much to me. It really showed how important customer service is to this restaurant and its staff and how far they are willing to go to make a mistake right.Now. About that chicken parm....Let me just say that it was WELL worth the wait!! I am a little picky about red sauce, but this was off the charts. Hearty and savory and spiced just the right way. Whatever you didn't fit on your fork, you just HAD to dunk your garlic toast in. The breading on the chicken was light, the meat was cooked perfectly so that you barely needed to use a knife to cut the chicken. To be honest, I reeeeeally regretted my decision earlier in the night that I would take half home for my husband to have for dinner!From start to finish, our dinner at La Tavola Italiana was wonderful. Great service, excellent food, and an atmosphere that made you feel welcome as soon as you walked through the door. I am SO glad my friend insisted we have our celebration dinner here, because I might never have found this place. And now that I have, I know that I will be back for sure!
Wendy's=This Wendy's is an okay location.  It isn't the best or the worst, just average.  Let me tell you why, if you really want to know...1.  The food here is usually good.  The burgers are always great.  I heart the Baconator.  I mean it is burger, bacon, and cheese without anything to distract from meat and cheese heaven.  YUM.  I know it is probably the worst thing on the menu but I LOVE it anyways.  When the craving hits, off to Wendy's I go.  The other sandwiches are always good too.  And the chicken nuggets are always great snacks.Where this Wendy's gets a lower rating is due to the fries and the Frostys (or is it Frosties????).  Both are always a crapshoot.  Sometimes the fries are fresh, hot and amazing and some times they taste so blah.  The Frostys are usually good, but every now and then they taste like they forgot to add sugar or something.  If these 2 items could be more consistent, my score would go up for sure.2.  The staff.  Sometimes you get the best people helping you, which is always so very nice.  And then there are the other ones.  One lady who works here, usually the drive thru is simply UGH.  She barks at you to order, doesn't give you a minute to look if you ask for one, and practically throws your food at you when you get up to the window.  You are almost afraid to ask for some ketchup from her.  Overall, I think 75% of the staff is really friendly, but if you go on the wrong day and get the other 25%, then I am sorry for you.So most of the time, this location is good.  My advice to you is to always check your fries and Frostys before you leave to make sure you got good ones!This Wendy's used to be so good.  Wendy's in general used to be good.  Dave is probably rolling in his grave right now.  Wendy is nothing more than a pimped out fast food prostitute, the life torn from her, all over the dollar.Not only is the food not good anymore at pretty much any Wendy's, but the quality of service is severely lacking at this one and most in general.  Like most fast food places to me now (which I rarely eat at because of the decline in quality) it's better to go within the few hours of opening.  The foods fresh(er) and the staff doesn't hate the world just yet.  This location isn't even worth visiting just because it's on the main drag.  They need to inject some quality control into the management, employees and food or Wendy's will be the new Rally's.
Pinoy Pinay Filipino Restaurant=Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #43 - #365My mom's friend's best friend treated us for dinner here at Pinoy Pinay. This is just another typical Filipino restaurant you'd find in any other city. The first impression that comes to me about this restaurant is that, it's a total DIVE! That doesn't mean the food is horrible. I'd say more average but not excellent. Since it's in Downtown, the area is not a great place to walk alone. The interior is very outdated and felt kind of dirty. Let's be honest here, the food is not that great but the prices are excellent and saved us a ton from eating on the strip. The place kind of reminded me of an old Filipino restaurant I ate at in Glendale in the 90's. The food wasn't that bad, more so and so. I picked up a tray and ordered the two item combo, pork barbecue skewers and chopped pork. Food was a bit cold and tasted old, the flavor in the barbecue was there and so was the chopped pork but they give you lots of rice! Would I come back here again? Maybe...
Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant=Firstly- this blows Dennys and IHOP out of the water when it comes to 24 chains. It's homemade and there is some love put into it. I would give this place a solid 4 for the food on a usual night (see- it's not something I'd rate as a 4 for a daytime breakfast- it's just A-OK) , but today the service was a miss and my pigs in a blanket didn't really have pigs. We were sat right away and a guy came to give us water and our drinks (not a server)....then we sat forever, and forever. BF waved down a guy to ask if someone can take our order. We then see him go get another guy and overhear their conversation that basically concluded that if we didn't speak up we would have never gotten an order because the guy didn't know there was anyone in his section. Gee, drink guy or lady who sat us, maybe tell the server if he's on break or maybe if he wasn't on break and doing other tasks to check his section once in a while. With the many staff we saw hanging out in the kitchen talking and hanging out or walking by us you'd think people would notice people waiting. We got our drinks refilled alright after the server knew we were there. BF got a Chef's Special- 2 French toast, 2 eggs and 2 sausages. - pretty good and standard.Mom in law got 2 biscuits&gravy w/ sausage and egg. Light biscuits and the gravy was nice and chunky with sausage and mushroom bits. Pretty decent. I got Apple Chicken Sausage Pigs in a Blanket- good sausage and the pancakes were light, fluffy and moist. Big hangup though- sheisty on the sausages! I have standard sized pancakes and I open them and only a HALF of a sausage was in each pancake......so it only had  half the pancake covered and the other half a empty, lonely blanket. (see picture) C'mon, most of the breakfast plates have more sausages than that. I ordered the 4 pigs thinking like most places that offer that many make a smaller pancake or a oval pancake that can surround a sausage from end to end. Better off getting a breakfast special so you can get pancakes, sausages, AND egg AND hasbrowns and maybe even some bacon or ham for the same price and wrap it yourself. I just think for $8.50 I should at least get enough sausage for the pancakes. Disappointing.  I know I don't feel well and am high off medication, but even I noticed that the tab was more than it should be. (see picture) Just saying, check your bills.  It was tabbed at $39.38 when it should be $30.42. Most places give you a electronic bill stapled to the original written pad, but here its totaled on the pad by hand. Since it is just handwritten here by people there is a possibility of making mistakes. The 2 stars is fair for this night.   It seems the raving reviews about the service is during daytime so maybe I will try a regular shift service...I know graveyard sucks, but c'mon it's your job to care and we just want to eat, pay for food and tip handsomely if you take care of us (my standard  20% for good, basic service, more for great service which I think is fair and generous) and go on home.Yeah this is hands down one of the best restaurants to get a delicious, hearty and home cooked from scratch breakfast!Like big portions? Mmmmm me too! lolI had the denver omelette and hashed browns. Easily on the list of mine for last meal on earth. Pancakes mmmmmm yeah baby. I love breakfast anytime of the day. This is my spot when wanting to fulfill my breakfast needs. Portions are big and hearty! We all love that! lolI am only rating on breakfast as I have been here twice for that only. I am positive without ever trying anything else on their menu that it is all pretty damn amazing! I would be willing to bet my last ducket on that!I love Blueberry Hill, I want to give the Owner a big kissy and give them an award for having a kick ass restaurant for me to enjoy!I will be back soon...very soon!The best of the Blueberry Hill restaurants in town. Counter service is reminiscent of diners in NJ.I LOVE THIS PLACE! Open 24/7! Just like Zippy's! Lol!Geez, what does Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant remind me of? Well........it kinda reminds me of a Yum Yum Tree, Denny's, The Original Pancake House, Zippy's.......all rolled up into one!Apparently Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has been around since 1966, but they have been serving the Las Vegas area since 1987! They have 4 restaurants within Las Vegas area, and I chose to take my friends to the restaurant on Decatur Blvd., as it was just across the street from the U.S. Post Office (I had to mail some stuff out), and because it was not too far from the downtown Las Vegas hotels.As we walked into this restaurant, it was packed! Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away. Upon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the "Grubsteaker Breakfast" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!One of my friends also picked the "Grubsteaker Breakfast" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an "Arnold Palmer?" Basically it's pineapple juice & lemonade......My other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say "Sugar Overload?" Lol!What can I say about my meal?Love it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn't have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland!The hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!Service was Excellent! I forgot to get our server's name, but she was friendly, fast, & efficient!What away to top off my quick trip to Las Vegas..........after eating my hearty breakfast, lunch was not needed...........I would be more than happy to come back here again for breakfast! I just love this place!
The Good Egg - Park Central=Oh The Good Egg. Or as I call it the I'm OK and Your Just Kinda OK Egg. Mediocre. Meh. Harmless not harmful. Kitchy but not catchy. Basic breakfast fare that tries to go outside the box with egg white omelets, low carb tortillas and southwestern fare. It's been called the Gay Egg and on weekends The Way Gay Egg. I appreciate its niche in the Phoenix restaurant scene. I do. It beats Denny's and IHOP. But now has competition from Matt's, Palette and Over Easy. I"m partial to any Central Ave. business and am sure I'll find myself here again. Service is mixed. Most are pleasant. Some. Well, some of them need a nap. While others might benefit from a double shot of espresso. I hate sitting at the horseshoe shaped counter. I find myself staring at the weathered individuals across the way wondering, "Gee, do you really need that extra bacon?". And on the flip side, I catch a few eyeballs focused on me and they're probably thinking, "I can't believe that guy has Hello Kitty sunglasses! Fag!"8/06Breakfast special- turkey wrap with country potatoes.  Service was a little slow; If I wasn't in a hurry to leave and make it to work on time, the wait wouldn't have been so terrible.  However, once I placed my order in, I swear, it didn't take but two or three minutes for the wrap to arrive.  I didn't know how to react, really.  I was happy that it came out so fast, yet I wondered, am I really getting oven-roasted turkey here, or is it processed?  Oh well...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-phoenix-2?select=NhFXFu6lTVY2XNBIMDdIxQ#NhFXFu6lTVY2XNBIMDdIxQGood bacon, and loved the ranch dressing, though I'd ask them to go easy on the dressing next time.  Liked the country potatoes that were on the crispier side, which there weren't many of.FYI, double-stamps on the weekends are back for the summer!I've eaten here several times with friends. This location is often referred to as "The Gay Egg" in the Gay & Lesbian community. The place where gays go for brunch on the weekends. I love that it's close to the light rail, they have free wi-fi connection and Stevia sweeteners. Restaurants that offer those automatically gets an upgrade in rating from me.They have a lot of healthy options here and have a small section of reduced fat, carbs and cholesterol free items for those watching their girlish figure.Portions are decent, but then again I don't eat a lot which is good.If your main order is more than $4.95, you can take advantage of their side order special. You can add dollar pancakes, side of fruit, etc.  for only $1. Cheap!
Roxy's Diner=Following a pleasant time with the cast of Pin Up and other Yelpers in the Level 107 Lounge after enjoying the show, and finding no food available there, Diane and I each had a sudden craving for a good dessert.  So we descended in the tower elevator to see what Roxy's on the casino level had available.  The dessert case in front featured various small cakes that appeared to be too large for just two people.  But, after perusing the menu, we saw that sundaes and other smaller possibilities were also available.  So, we presented ourselves for seating in one of the booths.Not long afterward, I saw that more substantial fare was also featured on the menu--besides half-pound burgers.  The hunger pangs became more incessant.  So, in addition to an Apple Cobbler ala mode to share, Diane ordered Popcorn Shrimp, and I a BLT with Fries.  Little did I know at the time that this would be the biggest BLT I had ever seen.  The massive sandwich was buoyed by lightly toasted Sourdough Bread that was smeared with a thin layer of mayonnaise as I had requested; contained crisp lettuce, fresh tomato slices, and very good just slightly crisp bacon.  It was accompanied by slightly malleable Skin-on Fries and a Kosher Dill Pickle spear.  All were very tasty.  Somehow, within I-1/2 hours I succeeded in polishing off the whole BLT, plus Diane's tender Onion Straws.Then came the baked Apple Cobbler with a very large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  Unfortunately, because the dessert had real Raspberry Sauce trails streaked all across the top, and Diane is allergic to berries, we had to send this dessert back.  But our server immediately offered to bake and bring forth a new one, which he rather quickly did--after making a diner at another table happy through receipt of a free Apple Cobbler covered with Raspberry Sauce.  So, service was very good, and all ended well with a delicious large, warm, and doughy homemade Apple Cobbler adorned only with Vanilla Ice Cream.4-1/2 stars overall on this particular big moon night!Oh Roxy...tsk effing tsk...This All American Diner is located in The Stratosphere off the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. This place is open 24/7 which makes it convenient at 3am when you've given the casino far too much dinero and start feeling a rumbly in your tumbly and immediately think "where can I go to give this place even more money?"The vibe here is a retro 50's style (more or less) and they have a giant screen playing some classic black and white flicks. They are also, allegedly, supposed to have a DJ and the servers are supposed to sing...I don't know if these events occur at certain times or on certain days, but when we visited we did not experience any of this (it was 11ish on a Thursday night).Now, the service was both good and bad. I say that because the servers on the one side of the restaurant seemed quick and extremely attentive. However, the side of the restaurant where my wife and I and many other poor unfortunate souls were sitting...not so much. This guy was slow. When it takes over five minutes to even be acknowledged and another ten just to receive water, that's when I have a problem. Normally, I would have walked out on a situation like this but I was tired, hungry, and already sitting so I really didn't want to try to find something else. I don't know what our server's issue was as I saw very little of him and saw the other servers zipping around their sections repeatedly.In fact, orders were left sitting for pick up at the kitchen window for far too long before our server grabbed them to be delivered. Thankfully our food was hot and did not sit long, but there was a burger that belonged to a guy sitting at a booth adjacently from us and my wife watched it sit at the window for about 10 minutes before it was delivered to the guy (we sat by the kitchen so it wasn't hard to notice). My wife tried to warn the guy that his food had been sitting a long time and commented that hopefully it was warm. The guy (who either could care less, was drunk, stoned, or a combination of the three) simply nodded his head. The food itself was about average although portions were a tad above average. The potatoes were slightly mushy but the bacon in my sandwich was good. My wife's meal was supposed to come w/ an English muffin which never came. When we DID see our server again, we informed him of the MIA muffin and he said he would grab it...which turned out to be a lie. My wife and I had a few more bites left of our meals and still no English muffin. This was the last straw... We were able to flag down a manager and complain about our experience so far and he told us he would return. He did. He came back a few minutes and nonchalantly informed us our meal was taken care of and we were good to go. My wife looked at me and said "I guess I don't get that English muffin..." "Guess not" I replied, "but we do get to make like a tree and get the hell outta here."So, based on my experience here, it's a one star, but since our meal was comped I am giving Roxy's two stars and that is the only reason as to why.
Cathay House Restaurant=The mission is on...to find a decent dim sum restaurant in Vegas and Cathay House was first on my list.  Originating from San Francisco, finding a stellar dim sum restaurant in the desert will definitely be a challenge!  But I'm on it!Cathay House was voted best dim sum in the local papers and received other accolades as noted on its wall.  I had high expectations!  It was bustling on a Sunday afternoon and there was a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2.  Once seated in the main dining room, ice water, tea, and forks arrived immediately.  (Forks?)  Okay, so there were chopsticks already on the table but I guess out here, they are used to people asking for forks.  There wasn't a huge variety of dim sum dishes to choose from, so that was already disappointing.  I did try the chicken feet in black bean sauce.  This dish lacked the full flavor that I'm used to.  The standard shrimp dumpling (har gow) and pork dumpling (shumai) were basic, if anything.  The salt and pepper shrimp had been sitting out too long after being stir-fried, not a good choice.  The beef rice noodle with a light soy sauce should be cut up to share a bit easier.  The crab claw puffs were average.I was anxious for the Shanghai dumplings, which they did not have.  Or the Shark Fin dumpling in soup with red vinegar and ginger slices to dip into.  Two of my favorites, and they were not available.  (And trust me, I did ask more than one employee for it.)Looking around for dessert, there were no egg custard tarts available or black sesame rolls.  I did see the sweet tofu, but that was about it.     There were a lot of dishes that weren't being ordered, in other words...they looked stale as they passed our table numerous of times.  When you see the same cart pass you when you first sit down, and realize that the same dishes are still not moving on it an hour later, the turnover of food is not happening here.I also think it's odd that they serve dim sum until 10 pm.  In my opinion, a true tea house restaurant should only serve dim sum during brunch hours.  That is the whole point of "drinking tea' aka yum cha or going for dim sum.  Overall, I don't plan on returning here unless I haven't found a better place yet.  My dining companion says this place WAS worthy of a three star in the past, but he had to change his review to a two now.  Sad sad.Late nate Chinatown Vegas eats!Cathay House has pretty good hours for those looking to eat a late dinner. They're open up to 5am (almost 24 hours- they open at 10am and close at 5am.)I came here for a late dinner and there were several folks who were also late night dining. This place seems to be known for their dim sum and at night time, they do offer some of their dim sum. We got a couple orders of their pork and shrimp siu mai. Aside from this, we ordered the wonton soup, pork chops, tofu with veggies and the chicken fried rice.The wonton soup was a nice starter. It had tasty broth and soft dumplings filled with pork. Next up for us was the pork and shrimp siu mai. It's no wonder their dim sum here is popular, because the pork and shrimp siu mai was delcious!  Our main courses of pork chops and tofu with veggies did not disappoint either. The pork chops were nice and crispy. They were also pretty lean. The tofu with veggies had a good mixture of greens and slices of tofu. All the dishes went well with the chicken fried rice. Portion wise was decent though the pork chop seemed fewer than what I've seen before. The rice was plentiful but not too much chicken. It was decent though and there was food for to-go!Not only was the food good, the price here was decent too with the bill just around $44[Review for DIMSUM only]I'm sure you've needed to buy a car - a brand-spanking-new one OR a semi-whored-out-used version - at one point in your life and have experienced a nagging-dying-to-complete-a-sale-to-take-out-a-chick-salesperson. It wasn't the greatest of experiences right?Well, meet the DIMSUM version.I really wonder if these ladies work here on a full commission basis OR have been set STRICT ASIAN QUOTAS (those having worked overseas OR know someone who does may have learnt at some point how some retail outlets staff actually have DAILY quotas to meet...OR else ADIOS bish). They sure fly around in their dimsum carts like the establishment is a go-cart-track...and pushing for sales a LOT more aggressively than I would say a carsalesperson would at the end of the month.Best part? The moment they knew I spoke Chinese...they went gung-ho-YOU-need-MORE-meat-on-you-SON-"YOUTOOSKINNNNNNNNNNNNNY" on me. (Bish, please...you look anoxeric! Maybe?) Well, they still WON...since I tend to be a pushover with asian-aunties-battling-menopause and their dimsum carts...and found my small table for 2 with food for at least 5 gargantuan eaters.Yet, this place, which was recommended by locals (asian ladies that you'd find working at the hotels and casinos that I randomly started conversations with to ask for tips on LOCAL food joints), isn't that great. (I think I got trolled.)Oilier dimsum...below average quality (just seems like the food sat out a little too long as well as tasting rather bland...)...and ISN'T PIPING HOT...mehBut what really killed it for me was this ever present sour taste that wasn't vinegar...and if you know your dimsum (OR even any other food in general)...this ISN'T A GOOD SIGN. Maybe, the health department might have to come over for an (S)INspection...before, as comedian Russel Peters imitates his dad, "Somebody Gonna Get a Hurt Real Bad".If you're craving dimsum, I'd say...just wait until you get out of Vegas and hit a real spot instead. And if you HAVE to be here, please don't order the dimsum BUT order ala carte dishes instead - at least if the food isn't that fresh, the raging fire under the wok will fudgingly kill everything in it.It may just save you a trip to the porcelain throne of shame. (Don't ask).This was only the second time I have been to Cathay House. I came for dim sum years ago and didn't have much of a desire to return but I couldn't resist giving them another chance recently.We arrived around noon and they weren't too busy. I felt rushed to order, even though we kept telling them we wanted to wait for our entire party to be seated. We ordered hot tea and waters all around and then proceeded to order from the carts that came around. They pushed the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good value at $15.99, it had to be reheated before they served it to us. The lobster was chewy and the noodles felt like total filler, didn't have much flavor and were overcooked. The highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls. The ribs had to be reheated for us before serving which was a turn off.The rest of the items we ordered weren't very memorable and I wouldn't recommend most, if any, of it. The coconut bun, egg custard, bbq pork buns and smelt were all completely forgettable.Service was ok, although refills were a little hard to come by for our waters and tea. There are other dim sum places in town I prefer with fresher items, so I don't see myself coming back any time soon.
Tacos El Compita=4.5 starsFINALLY!!!!   I've found real Mexican food in Las Vegas!  I've been searching for over 4 years.  It's been an emotional roller coaster of getting my hopes up only to be disappointed time and time again.  Growing up in Southern California I guess I have high standards.  But no more let downs, my search is ended.This place is no joke.  It's as good if not better than many of the taco trucks I've eaten at in L.A.They serve the best, most perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned tripas.  The buche was awesome - tender and juicy.  Carnitas - not tex mex crap - this is the real deal.  Like southern pulled pork.Cabeza was great, the carne asada solid, the al pastor was up there.I've had better tortillas but I'm not complaining - these worked.The food was so delicioso it actually brought a little tear to my eye.  And talk about cheap eats.  Tacos are like a buck each.  Be sure not to order more than 2 or 3 tacos per person at a time - they're best served hot off the grill.  You can always go back to the counter and order again, and again, and again....And be sure to throw a five spot in their tip jar, they deserve it.(photos submitted)
Redbeard's Bar & Grill=Redbeard's made my bad night even worse.I know when I sit down at a bar  I don't scream dollar signs but yet and still I expect to be treated with some kind of decadency since I am a paying customer.  This was a truly crummy experience. Going to the bar alone is risky case in point with this review, I am use to being over looked but not treated rudely. I ordered a Carona and when I asked for a lime the bartender let out an audible sigh and then shoved a lime wedge at me on a napkin.  I know my way around a bottle of beer and Carona's are served with a lime wedge stuffed into the bottle...but for whatever reason it was too much of a hassle. Also on my visit the bartender introduced himself and asked the names of the ladies who sat down next to me, even though they came in a full 20 minutes after I already been sitting there. He never once gave me his name or asked for mine that hurt my feelings.I want to add that I ordered 3 tacos and all of my taco shells were burned and the tacos had no salsa or sauce of any kind.  I have burned many a taco shell and I know it would have only taken the cook a measly 30 seconds to reheat more shells but they served them to me in burned shells anyway.  I have plenty of disposable income and I don't mind sharing it, but tonight I had to tip my bartender 2 centers and trust me it hurt me more than it hurt him.
Thai Taste=This is the best Thai food in Charlotte.  I repeat.  This is the BEST Thai food in Charlotte. Another one of the "secret" restaurants that you need to be told about it's located in the Dilworth area right next to the popular gift store Paper Skyscraper.  The original and best of several locations (Matthews, University) I went there religiously the entire time I lived in CLT.  As diverse as their menu was, I only sampled three dishes there Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao and "House Noodles".  The last one being a specialty that's no longer listed on the menu.  The rating system is 1 to 6 stars and you can even order it with no stars for the scared or gastro-intestinally challenged.  For the true "chili head" you can augment the rating system.  Normally, they use crushed Thai peppers in the food which are still hot but don't capture the true essence of the "heat" and flavor.  When you're ready for the big leagues make sure to denote "fresh peppers" when giving them your stars.  The flavor difference is immediately noticeable from the very first bite.For lunch during the week you need to get there by 11:30am or after 1:00pm unless you want to stand in line for a long time.  The place is popular and regularly packed.  They get all the businesses in the area, the residents of the trendy Dilworth neighborhood and a boatload of cops.  For many (like myself) this place is an addiction and you will see many regulars.I can't say enough good things about this place.  When I spent most of '07 overseas this was one of the first places I hit upon returning to the States.  Even now, all other Thai places I encounter are measured against Thai Taste.  If you spend any time in the Charlotte area you simply MUST try this restaurant out, you will not be disappointed.*side note* For the truly adventurous you can go past the 6 star rating, but be prepared for "heat" especially when going the "fresh peppers" route.  Also be aware that anything over 10 stars is a personal challenge to the chef and he will guarantee you feel more heat/pain than you ever have in your life.  Enjoy responsibly.This is the only time I have ever felt deceived by a high star number on Yelp.  My husband and I were walking around Southend pub hopping, and when it was time for dinner we pulled out the 'ol Yelp app and found this place right around the corner and with a solid four star rating.  We LOVE thai food, and we know that it is always a good option for vegetarians in unknown restaurant areas.  Unfortunately we were completely underwhelmed.The restaurant itself is really cute - lots of wood paneling, Thai themed decor and paintings, wood tables and chairs.  The staff was also very friendly.  That's about where anything resembling four starts ends for me.  I ordered the Pad Thai as I have found this to be steadily good in the twenty or so other Thai restaurants I have eaten at around the country.  Here, it tasted like it was mixed up with a weird sweet and sour sauce.  Pad Thai should not be sweet.  At all.  They also did not give us the option for hotness levels, which I didn't think of until after we ordered, so our food came out very mild.  My husband ordered the Pad Woon Sen, which while better than my Pad Thai, was still unimpressive.  I left disappointed with a sticky sweet taste in my mouth.If this had come up on the app as a three star restaurant, our experience would have been much more explainable.  Hopefully the food is better other times, though what was coming out to other tables looked much like what we were served so I don't know.  I would give the ambiance, location and service a four, but the food a one or two.  I can't give this place a three star review, because I really don't feel that it's "A-ok".  So we'll go with the two star "Meh, I've experienced better", because that's exactly how I feel.I've been wanting to try this place for a year and a half and with my impending due date in sight I was determined to get some spicy food! We ordered the veggie spring rolls to start and while I wasn't a huge fan, the chili sauce they are served with is spectacular! I got the chicken pad see ew and omg! Best dish I've ever had!!!! I ordered it the first time at a "2" heat level and the second time- just a few days later at a "3"...; super amazing! If you are in the area and want to get some great food, stop by Thai Taste!!!! You will not be disappointed!
Sullivan's Steakhouse=I had booked on OpenTable and when I arrived on time, we were immediately seated to a table even though there were others waiting near the hostess stand. Awesome.Looking over the menu, I had made my decision from the rather expensive listing of steaks and side dishes. That changed when our waiter - Matt, who was awesome - went over the evening's specials. Suddenly, the idea of a trio of small filet mignons was what I wanted and each with a different topping/sauce. Massive wine list but only a small list of beers and an even smaller list of local beers. In fact, just one. OMB Copper. All three of us started with the wedge salads. These were good portions with plenty of blue cheese to go with the lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Not a bad deal for $4!When they arrived, the steaks looked perfect. Three small filets, each in a different sauce. The first two, a bearnaise and an Oscar, I enjoyed thoroughly. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of sauce on top. But by the time I had cut into the third one, it was no longer quite so perfect. More overdone than I ordered and a bit of a tougher cut, especially since the first two were so good. Bummer.For dessert, I let Matt talk me into the bread pudding. It was... fair. Just not that great with not enough taste and some of the topping was over done. I wouldn't have this again.On the pros list, no wait for a seat when we had a reservation, excellent service from Matt, a local beer choice, great salad, and great steaks.On the cons list, the booth was a bit too tight for the three of us to sit comfortably. Perhaps another inch or two, please? Only one choice for a local beer. Most of the steaks were great and the dessert was only fair.Complimentary valet parking is nice, as there is not much street parking nearby.Sullivan's is a higher-end steak joint and works hard to earn that high dollar menu.
El Burrito Mexican Restaurant=So this is a family restaurant that has been in Las Vegas since 1969 and has some food options that can't be found anywhere else in Las Vegas. The nameless, homemade noodle soup with cheese is out of this world. The salsa is homemade and they have two options, one that is hot and one that is more of a chunky salsa, the chips are also homemade and delicious. They also offer lots of different options, with mix and match dinner entrees as well.Bottom line, you will never satisfy everyone on any aspect but I support family run and small businesses not to mention Las Vegas locals.The margaritas also are hand poured and are divine. So try it, trust me, you will like it!My friend and I were on the hunt for some fried ice cream, the majority of the restaurants near us either closed early or were closed Sunday's. So we had the choice of eating here or at Coasta Cantina at the Suncoast. Walking in, there was no hostess, she was in the back and emerged to bring another customer her order, when she did acknowledge us, she was very friendly and proceeded to seat us, handed us the menus, and took our drink orders. Their website states they offer happy hour from 8 p.m. to close on Sunday's, but I can't confirm since there was no mention of it to us.I took a look at the menu because I was craving ceviche but they did not have any, which was a bit of a let down because all of the Mexican restaurants I've visited have it. We just ended up ordering the dessert we originally came for, fried ice cream and also ordered some sopapillos. After we placed our order, the dessert came out around 5 minutes later. We took a look at our fried ice cream and were a bit thrown off. It looked pre-made, it was cold on the outside, no whipped cream, no cherry on top, and the texture was weird, it looked glazed, and came in a cinnamon shell. It was like no fried ice cream we've ever had, it's normally fried before it's brought out, so it's warm on the outside, cold on the inside, not here. Now for the sopapillos, they were not thick or fluffy enough, they did have good flavor since they were coated with cinnamon and sugar but it's a dessert that is very hard to screw up. After we received our order, no one came to check up on us, it took a little while to receive our checks so basic customer service was definitely lacking and there were only two other tables when we walked in. I was really disappointed. Overall we decided on this place because it was smaller and we thought, why not give our business to a mom and pop restaurant instead of a corporate company, but it was a mistake.
Nakama=This is a god-awful excuse for a restaurant.  The actual serving of food is last on its list of priorities, which run something like this:1) Having heavily-made-up waitresses treat diners rudely.2) Functioning as a place for bald-headed men to drink.3) Using "valet parking" to totally tie up the intersection of 17th and Carson.4) Being a mediocre-to-poor Americanized "Japanese" restaurant.I had sushi the only time I came here (probably about three years ago).  It was really bad.  Cold, rubbery rice that not only didn't have any rice vinegar in it, but wasn't properly cooked.  Rolls looked like they had been created in a fit of pique by a drunken marmot or other mammal lacking opposable thumbs.  And the fish, while not being actively spoiled, was not notable for its freshness either.If you want hibachi, try Yokoso.  If you want excellent, authentic sushi, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill.  If you want pretty decent, cheap sushi, try Oishii Bento in Oakland.  But for the love of god, don't come here for any reason.Let me start with what works at Nakama: The servers. They're super nice and efficient.What doesn't work is the food, the prices, the crowds, the incredibly busy, loud bar without the possibility of being seated in the quieter room (reserved only for Habachi eaters) -- even when you're paying $15.00/person FOR LUNCH!  And, the restaurant demands that you dress in nice casual wear. No t-shirts, yet the food was terrible!We shared the Spider Roll and the Chicken and Shrimp Habachi plate, as well as a seaweed salad. The salad was okay. The Spider Roll came in a sticky, overly-sweet sauce which ruined the flavor. The crab was rubbery and seemed old. The chicken Habachi was waaaaaaay overcooked (dry to the point of being hard to swallow),  the shrimp smelled old , and it was NOT DEVEINED (read: it still had the poop tunnel in it!). ICK! This is supposed to be Pittsburgh's finest sushi restaurant? Old fish meets overcooked chicken, meets truly bad sushi, meets loud bar with no option to sit elsewhere (even when you're not drinking), meets overpriced lunch menu!My advice: Go elsewhere! If you want something to eat, check out ANY other restaurant in the South Side. Even if it's bad, it won't be as expensive as Nakama. But, there are better places to be had in Pittsburgh. Not being from the area, I can't speak for sushi bars, but,  I especially like The Gypsy Cafe and Primanti's in the South Side. Cheers!
Original Pancake House=I had a really bad experience here. I had been dying to try the apple pancake that I had heard many good things about, so I headed to the Original Pancake House. The service was terrible. The server practically forgot my table existed. I had to wait a long time for anyone to even approach the table. When she finally did, I ordered a coffee and the apple pancake. My coffee came out and EW, there was lipstick on the cup. Unfortunately I didn't notice until the waitress had already wandered away from the table and when I was finally able to get her attention again, it took her far too long to return with a fresh cup. When my pancake arrived, it was enormous. I looked down to get my fork in preparation of my first bite of apple-y goodness and was appalled to find my fork was dirty. I again had to try to get my waitress' attention to replace my fork, which again took forever.  Finally, I'm ready to eat. The flavor was nothing spectacular and I became bored about three bites in. I really don't have too many positive things to say about this place and can't say I'm particularly motivated to try it again after this negative breakfast experience.This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. I had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). Service is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. My family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same. I mean there wasn't even a piece of orange or parsley or melon on my plate like there usually is when you order breakfast at any other breakfast placeOur waitress was a superstar,  older woman and so friendly and attentive to our needs even anticipated our needs having our grand daughter there.  OPH was my first job in mid 70's actually inspiring me to become a chef and restaurateur.  My main job was preparing the famous corned beef hash in the Hawaii locations. Since then,  I've always made OHP my home and boasted on their food and quality especially since I've lived in Portland,  OR where the original location and family resides boasting the famous passed down starter cultures that make up my beloved Dutch Baby. So one thing I know and know well is OPH food especially the corned beef that I've made all my life. 2 stars are for my waitress and her service which if yelp broke the ratings in categories I'd give her 5 stars and hire her any day in any if my restaurants. Now to the food.  It just sucked period! The Dutch baby was so flat and pancakes were soured only meaning they don't follow protocols for the starters and batter was old and not kept refrigerated causing it to sour. My so called corned beef was a blatant ripoff, they tried to pass off their older ham chopped up and with onions all fluffy and they couldn't make hash with ham because it comes out like fluffy hamburger.  Even waitress said others complained the same thing.  Don't take my word for it, see for yourself,  all I ask is you know what corned beef is and eaten at other locations besides vegas. They are cutting corners to save on food costs and waste. Shame on you!!!!!My concerns and disappointment was addressed with the manager or owner,  the older gentleman but he denied my findings as a professional chef and was extremely rude even though I was being courteous.  This leads me to believe that the cooks run the place without challenge or proper management.  I will forward my findings to Portland along with the pictures of the fake corned beef.  I did pay for everything and never asked for a discount or any refunds.  It's just a crime what they're doing to such a wonderful franchise and food concept. Change management and food and maybe we won't lose our last OPH in Vegas.Q: Where can you find...church goers, hungover peeps, masses of kids and some of the quickest, delicious breakfast in all of Charlotte? A: Original Pancake HouseYup, it's a smorgasbord of hungry folks and it's tasty. And yes, it's a chain, but I can't help but express my love for this particular OPH. If you're looking for breakfast, early in the mornin' or late in the afternoon, I highly recommend dropping by here. If you make this particular breakfast run on a Sunday, be prepared to run into a line of hungry folks. But it's ok, really - don't you fear. A very long line absolutely flies into the restaurant in lighting quick speed. I don't know how many cooks OPH has working, but those guys/gals are really, really fast. Thus the tables turn really, really quickly. No joke, as soon as hubs and I are seated we are out of there in 30-40 minutes at the longest. I usually order the French Crepes - perfectly cooked, delicious, thin crepes stuffed with fresh strawberries accompanied by a side of strawberry sauce. I typically order only two as the regular order comes with three and I just can't handle that much delectable goodness. Make sure you try the turkey sausage too - it's pretty amazing. If you're more of an omelet fan, OPH makes them the size of footballs. They.are.huge. Oh, and they come with a side of pancakes, so be sure to come hungry. This particular joint is a staple for me as I'm always craving those damn crepes. Thanks, OPH!Everything I ate here today tasted like it was concocted in back from bags of dried egg, pancake mix, and the scariest of all - hollandaise powder. Fatty texture but not even a little butter or lemon flavor in that mother of all breakfast indulgences. Burnt, dry, microwave tasting omelettes, puffed and brown. Freezer-flavored hash browns with no crisp to them whatsoever. Basically, the best argument towards anti-corpo food that I've eaten in a long, long while. It hurt pretty bad, as I used to frequent this chain constantly as a kid - the Kosher made my gma+gpa happy, dad went for the apple pancake, week in, week out. Smoked salmon, potato pancakes, it was all delish. And strawberry pancakes, with fresh whipped cream, were totally my jam.This new thing sporting the same name is like the OPH I remember but nightmarishly riffing off the nastiest of Denny's. Potato pancakes thin like paper, eerily tasting of potato, floppy and gummy. Sour cream in tiny, spit-cup sized containers. Watered down applesauce. No thanks.
Los Tacos=I love their carne asada burrito con todos! The con todos makes it super creamy. The flavor is just amazing. I've been a big fan of their food since early 2000s. One of my coworkers introduced me to this place one day when I asked him where I can get a delicious burrito. The size of the burrito seems to have gotten smaller. I used to have trouble finishing it. But still, I think they are one of the best in town. I recommend using a generous amount of their green (verde) sauce.  I could probably use half a bottle on my burrito. So if they run out, you can blame me. I also like their shrimp & fish ceviche tostadas. There are other locations in town but I feel like this original location is the best.What we call $4 tacos at 74th street Baptist church, we call a sinny-sin-sin... $3 is the most I would ever pay for a taco.... so how did I end up paying $4 each for 3 here? Oh, the toppings are extra. Yep, extra on top of an already overpriced 'co. Lord knows how they figure out what's what. $.15 here, $.35 there, $.07 around the corner, $.27 for a bag... This whole experience was a mess. I tried to get all three tacos without sour cream and 2/3 ended up with it, my veggie taco ended up being carnitas (and $4), it took 12 min at the window to get my food, the wrong salsa was in the bag, oh, and the tacos were $4 each. Three tacos shouldn't cost more than 2 burritos. The three stars is bc naturally they were delicious. -2 for the price and wack job service (even for a drive through). Next time, I'm headed to Tacos El Gordo.Went to lunch on a Friday afternoon here. Since I have been to Tacos El Gordo so many times I wanted to give these guys another try since the first time was the Taco Trek UYE months ago (Thanks Nelson Q!).I was pretty hungry so I was thinking the standard Carne Asada Burrito would fill me up based on the tacos I got last time. If you  refer to my pic, the burrito was not all that big. In fact, if you don't tell them you want it with everything (which is cheese, guacamole, and sour cream for an extra 1.50), all that's in there is just the meat and beans. So for 5.75 you get a tiny burrito. Add the 1.50 just so you can a little more stuffing in it. I paid a total of 7.84 with tax. Now I don't know about you guys, but lots of other places would give you a huge burrito for that price. So yes, I was a bit disappointed.While I was eating, I noticed a majority of the patrons were Caucasian. Weird. If you go to Tacos El Gordo, its mainly Mexicans. So what am I missing? Are you telling me that Los Tacos is more of an Americanized establishment? Don't get me wrong. To me there's nothing wrong with that. It just didn't look right. Some other things I noticed: They don't have a salsa bar. They do have salsa verde in squeeze bottles on just about every table. I guess you have to ask them for other sauces on the side if you don't like the green sauce which I thought is pretty good.Next couple of visits I will try the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada because I saw somebody order it and scarf it down. I was so tempted to interrupt their first bite just so I can ask to take a picture of it. LOL.
Memphis Championship Barbecue=I don't know WHO thinks this is real BBQ. They must have either 1) never eaten real BBQ or 2) never had food with flavor before.This CRAP is disgusting, bad location, no flavor. Brisket sandwich had NO flavor or bbq sauce and all fatty meat. The TriTip was just a few slices of fatty meat with no flavor.The hus puppies were OK, kinda burnt. For $25 bucks I'd rather eat anywhere else. What a waste of time and money.
Pizza Hut=This Pizza Hut is great. For chain pizza this location seems to make it like was back in the day. When I order pan pizza it is thick and cooked all the way through. They always have deals as most pizza places do. When they have the deals for any pizza, any size, any crust, I wish they would honor that and not charge extra for stuffed crust. Any crust means ANY CRUST. Okay... I got that out. The wings are bomb-diggity! if you don't know about Wing Wednesday then you should check it out. Wings are 50 cents each. I get an order of 8 buffalo burnin' hot (boneless) for $4 and it comes with a side of dressing. There is a good selection of flavors.Sometimes I order for delivery but usually just pick it up since it is close to my home and quicker. I always order online and never have any problems.
El Pulgarcito De America=Oh sweet Jesus in the manger. Really the first thing I thought of when I woke up today was I would love some papusas. Now this makes for a great restaurant.We ordered a big breakfast of fried eggs over easy, plantains, beans and crema and papusas. The papusas are like pancakes - you can ordered them stuffed with beans and cheese or pork! Talk about $1.50, let me order 27. It's quite the bargain $12 check average and we pigged.I was eyeing every other customers food, they served a shrimp cocktail in a deep glass with salsa and avocados on the bottom, I saw the guy put hot sauce on his shrimp and I wanted to crawl over Julia S. and go sit with them. There is a reason this place is packed.I wonder what time they open?
Los Compadres Mexican Food=Cheese crisp!!!  This place is *right* across the street and I've only been a few times.  Tonight, I needed something fast, close and naughty!  So, I remembered someone recommending the cheese crisp.The tortilla was super-crispy and LOADED...LOADED...LOADED with cheese!  I also got the green chile strips on it.  They were huge strips and cut the greasy cheese just right.  Side of awesome guac - had a little kick to it!  The place itself isn't fancy at ALL.  There are a few different rooms to dine in.  Service was really friendly - all young boys.  Woohoo!Los Compadres is an A-ok place to stop and have some A-ok Mexican food. You order via a friendly counter service and they give you a number. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. They were good! Nothing fancy or spectacular, just straightforward. I wished for a little more flavor in the chicken, but it wasn't horrible. I also ate Ayesha's leftovers the next day... solid. If you're looking for a spot that's a bit "hole in the wall" simple Mexican, then Los Compadres is the spot for you! I would gladly return and try their other entrees!Hang on...gotta wipe the cheese off my chin.  Oh, crap, the enchilada sauce is on my keyboard.Cheese crisp with Guacamole.  Two cheese enchiladas, one for tomorrow.There's a mess.  Everywhere.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhyessssssssssss!Why 5 stars?Freakin' awesome Mexican food, and CRAZY cheap prices!So, I went a bit overboard (as always) in ordering.I just wanted to try so many different thingsssssI got:Cheese crisp with green chile strips and guacamoleMini green chile chimichanga1 cheese enchiladaSide order of refried beansChips and salsaAll that food... .$15And it ended up being way too much food.  WAY too much.I loved everything...EVERYTHING I SAY!And that's truly a rarity.
Blue Moon Bar & Grill=You know, I have a knack of always managing to sit by the scary, crazy guy when I dine alone. I was really, really, really hoping that this would only be a CA thing and that other states would not bring me this problem.No. I really do have a talent of sitting by crazy people...nationwide. So, despite the fact that I was flanked by a drunk who was obsessed with both his fake knees and trying to sue corporate America, a photographer who kept trying to smoke me out, a professor who fancied fine scotch and corrected my grammar, and two girls singing Meatloaf....well...guess that tells you about the culture now, doesn't it?! Pretty fun place that's not overwrought with drunk college students becuase it's a little bit of a distance from campus.Milwaukee, a little over an hour from Madison, is a beer-drinker's city. I hate beer; but it is important to mention that a lot of beer comes from WI. Mind you, it's mostly Pabst, Schlitz, and stuff of that caliber. But there are also some fine WI staples and microbrews....Spotted Cow coming up the most....many of which are on tap here. That said, I was both surprised and impressed that Sierra Nevada was also on tap here. But, it's not a trip to Wisconsin without indulging in what they do best, fried cheese curds. If you've never had them, imagine fried mozzarella...but much better. They were pretty good here; but I wish they came with marinara sauce instead of (or in addition to) ranch.Bar staff is pretty cool.
La Oaxaquena Mexican Restaurant=I have been back several times since my initial review and have not been disappointed. Today, Norm and I braved out the south side of 19th ave and Peoria. Once again it was an excellent meal, especially for $5.35. I had the red chili burrito with rice and beans and shared chips and salsa with Norm. The burro was full of chunks of beef simmered in red sauce and covered with cheese and more red sauce. The rice was perfect and the bean... oh the beans... you cannot have better. The staff was on top of it and extra friendly.Who wouldn't love a restaurant with great prices, deep fuschia walls (yes!), friendly service, great food ... and lots of parking? (Hear that, Los Reyes de la Torta?)Upon reading Daren C's review, I decided to try this place for lunch and had the pleasure of having Daren join me too. I ordered the green chili burro lunch special. The burro was huge, had large chunks of tender beef, and was nicely seasoned. The rice that came with the meal was tasty, and the beans - wow, they're knock-your-socks-off good! We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good, and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil. Hmm, culinary secrets are sometimes hard to pry out of people. A great, generous meal for $5.35, tax included. So happy to have this gem in my neck o' the woods!
Fiesta Filipina=Having been to the Philippines working on U.S. Military projects, I was used to ethnic Filipino cuisines while I was there decades ago.I came to know that an old professional colleague of mine is now a Las Vegas resident and was quite surprised to received my unexpected call. With his directions, we eventually met at this Filipino restaurant for a quick lunch, for I intended to be driving back to LA afterwards that day.However, the quick lunch turned out into a seemingly endless feast of Filipino cuisines and delicacies, as we talked about old times, the best of times, as well as the worst ones in the Philippines and in various countries we've been while deployed overseas.I was glad I relented coming to Fiesta Filipina, instead of insisting for my friend to come over for buffet at the restaurant in my hotel.Incidentally, the word "Fiesta" in Filipino language means feast, and that was really a sumptuous feast we had.The next time I'll be in Vegas, I'll definitely come by this place near the southeast corner of Jones and Desert Inn.And indeed, just like aged fine wines, old time friends are certainly considered the best.Fiesta Filipina is one of my go to spots for Filipino food whenever I'm in Vegas. I like the location, selection of food and overall atmosphere of the place.Most Filipino restaurants in Vegas are on Maryland Parkway but this one is located on Jones Blvd. It's in at the corner of a small strip mall. I like this location because it's easy to find and get to. It's also not too crowded.The place is small and cute. Their decor is very Filipino with welcome and goodbye signs in Tagalog. They have kawayan bamboo wood decor around. Their back wall has a neat collage of Filipino celebrities who have frequented the restaurant. There are flat screen TVs on both ends of the restaurant where people can enjoy the latest sport game on cable or something on  the Filipino channel.This place is not a buffet, instead it is turo- turo (Tagalog for point point). There is a display of food ready to eat and you point to which dish you want. They have a vast selection of traditional Filipino foods like kare-kare (meat in peanut butter broth), caldereta (beef stew), Filipino bbq skewers (chicken and beef), beef steak (beef with onions), menudo (pork stew), sinagang ns isda (sour fish soup) and lumpia (Filipino egg rolls).  If you don't want anything from the ready made dishes,  they do have some items that you can order and they can prepare especially for you like crispy pata (fried pork). For drinks, they have Filipino cantaloupe juice and various sodas. They offer dessert too! They have halo halo (Filipino shaved ice) and turon (Filipino banana egg rolls). On my last visit here, I tried the kare-kare, the chicken skewers,  the beef steak and the turon. The kare kare broth on top of the white rice was a winner. I also liked the tender chicken skewers that surprisingly had a spicy kick to it. The beef steak had lots of shredded beef with onions. This one was good but a bit oily. The turon was a nice treat at the end. Crispy and sweet, the turon is a good deal for a $1. Like my previous visits, I left happy and full! I also had plenty of left over to take to-go.This is a good spot to go to for Filipino food in Vegas!If you're looking to get some authentic Filipino food, then Fiesta Filipina should be on your list of Pinoy places to try out.The decor was quaint, wooden, and very reminiscent of traditional Phillipine household decor. I really liked the vibe of this place; the staff was all friendly and ordering went smoothly. It's a turo-turo place (tagalog translation: to point), so you basically point to the dish you want to order and then you pay at the end of the line. It's an easy way to try a lot of different foods in one place, to be honest. Don't expect super fancy dining either, what you see is what you get -- traditional Filipino dishes. I had the two item combo plate which comes with steamed rice and two choices of entrees. I picked the sinigang na bangus (milkfish in a soup that has a tamarind base) and the classic Filipino beefsteak. What a good deal because it was under $10!The portioning for the sinigang na bangus was one fish steak with some soup, but they could've thrown in some veggies other than ginger. It had the superb sour taste, which means they put the right amount of sampalok (tamarind) in the soup.The beefsteak was PERFECT! It had the strong kalamansi taste (more citrusy) which went well with the tenderness of the beef and sweetness of the white onion. It really was marinated to the right taste... It's making my mouth water just thinking about it! It's THE perfect pairing to your steamed rice. The steamed rice, however, was a little more on the wet side, which isn't ideal but still good to eat.This is a good showcase of Filipino heritage. The kind of food they have out is the kind of food you actually have to (and want to!) try within the Filipino food realm. Oh, and they have good BBQ skewers! Ang sarap!
Jamerica Caribbean Restaurant=I haven't eaten much Jamaican food. But jerk chicken, oxtail and fried plantains come to my mind right away along with colorful tropical drinks. When I first saw Jamerica's menu I was surprised to see curry and BBQ on it. After some looking into the cuisine. Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavors, spices and influences from the native people on the island of Jamaica, and the Spanish, British Africans, Indian and Chinese who have inhabited the island.    Mango Rundown was cabbage and carrots stewed in coconut milk with  yellow curry on a bed of beans and rice. The rice perfectly soaked up the sweet sauce. The jerk chicken and BBQ(not sweet kind) chicken were fall off the bone tender, A chill night out with Bob Marley of course playing in the background.
Joe's Crab Shack=It's a good 10 miles or so from the Vegas Strip.  But this location of this chain crab and seafood restaurant is so totally Las Vegas.  It screams "tourists, come inside!". You've got the tacky weathered all wood pseudo shack with "Joes Crabshack" sign outside.  Inside, there are Christmas lights all year, the big goofy 12' long fake fish hanging from the ceiling, men's bathroom with "Dudes" on it, and a special on 60 oz. pitchers of beer. And as a special treat, the kids had the best balloon guy ever.  For one kid, he did a Darth Vader all black "hat" with a black sword.  For a little girl, he created an orange fish with blue bubbles.  And for her sister, created a six petaled flower with green steams.  We were seated in about 5 minutes at 7 PM on a Friday night.  I really had low expectations of this place since I didn't enjoy my surf and turf meal at their Denver Colorado location a few years back.  Although I love crab, I hate to get my hands and shirt all dirty at a restaurant.  I will get sloppy at home where I can take a shower immediately after, but not here.  Pots of crab and seafood were the most popular item here.  A lot of the items are fried, like fish and chips, fried crawfish, fried shrimp. My brother had the lump crab cake dinner with two crab cakes, a small bowl of coleslaw, and french fries ($13).   The two crab cakes were moist and naturally sweet with the true subtle crab flavor coming through, with just a slight douse of onion and garlic.  The fries were tender and crisp, and not too greasy.  The cole slaw had bits of red and green cabbage, and carrots in a slighlty tangy and very sweet mayo dressing. I would give that meal a 4.5 rating.  I had the half and half crawfish combo ($12) with one half crawfish etouffee with bits of crawfish in a warm creamy sauce.  The other half was deep fried crawfish tails. It was served with rice and cocktail sauce. Both are actually good and not overcooked.  I only at 1/3 of it because of my New Year's resolution to reduce my intake of fried foods. Myh meal was perhaps 3.5 stars. Our meals were enhanced by the beers on tap. My brother had Sam Adams regular lager, I had the Blue Moon.Service was attentive enough. Music playing in the background was classic rock and pop from the 70s to the 90s.  The place is loud and energetic, with little kids and adults loving the tacky atmosphere, comedic balloon guy, and the food.  It was a pretty good experience here. .We dined here a couple times so far this year.  The Station Square location is okay.  We really wanted to eat outside, but the picnic tables looked pretty dilapidated.  So, we opted for a booth inside.  This place is so kitzy.  Even the tables are a designer's worst nightmare.  They have beach junk everywhere.Both times, our service was fairly attentive.  On our recent visit, I went crazy and got a Crab Daddy feast.  Three kinds of crab legs:  Snow crab, Dungeness crab and and King crab!  I honestly don't know which was which.  My bf even had to train me in the use of the crab cracker and the claw.  Love, love, loved playing with my food.  Nothing more fun than eating with your hands.  What a mess!!  It came with my choice of seasoning, I picked Chesapeake Style which is basically Old Bay Seasoning even on new potatoes and corn on the cob.  BJ got the Skillet Paella.  The skillet had clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops and sausage a tomato basil sauce served over rice and topped with crisp calamari.  No mess here.  He was cheating!I believe there are three very important elements for a great dining experience.  Service, atmosphere and quality food.  Joe's Crab Shack seems to get by without any of these three......LOL
Landmark Diner Restaurant=Finally popped my Landmark Diner cherry this weekend. Can't believe it's taken me 9.5 years to try this place out.The menu has anything and everything. On top of that, a giant board of specials greeted us when we walked inside the door. The place was hoppin' for lunchtime Saturday.I've seen the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives episode at least a dozen times so I of course had to get the turkey, dressing and gravy. Huge serving. I took half home for lunch the next day. I'm a big fan of any meal covered in gravy. Craving some Thanksgiving? Go to Landmark and get this. The lunch portion comes with two sides. I went with green beans and a cup of vegetable soup. Loved the flavor of the soup. I will definitely get that as a side every time.Here's a rundown of what the rest of my crew ordered: -The fried chicken basket. This is quite the deal. The basket is huge. It comes with onion rings AND two sides. -Chicken pot pie. This was on the specials board and it was fantastic. Classic comfort food.-Roast pork and gravy. This was also on the specials board. Great flavor.-Fried apple sticks. Oh man, were these yummy. Ooey gooey apple goodness inside each one-Chocolate cream pie. Get it and share it. I made the mistake of ordering one for just myself. I was in a food coma when it was all said and done.My turkey lunch, pie and coffee all came to about $13. Not bad at all. I will definitely be adding Landmark to my lunch rotation.
Food Shoppe=Why are people not worshipping this place!?! Where is the Review of the Day (ROTD) for Food Shoppe?  PIttsburgh Yelpers, this place is flipping amazing, and someone needs to get the word out about the Food Shoppe.So if you've been reading my reviews, you know that my love of New York City and living in Astoria runs pretty deep.  Living in Pittsburgh makes me miss the food of Astoria greatly.  So imagine my delight when I found the Food Shoppe.  This is the closest thing to that type of neighborhood deli/ butcher you'll find in Pittsburgh.  The Food Shoppe is on my walk home, and we're going to have a beautiful relationship.  It's been cut short with the cold winter, but I will be back daily now that it is warm!Deli:  Boar's Heads meats and cheeses at the same to slightly lower prices than the grocery stores.  However, they guys behind the counter can actually make recommendations, unlike the grocery store.Create Your Own Sandwich:  Maybe the best part of this place.  You can create your own sandwich ($4.59) on fresh white, wheat, or rye bread with Boar's head meat and cheese.  At no additional cost, you can add lettuce, tomato, mayo, and/or mustard as well.  If you want extra meat, cheese, or a baguette it's only $1 more!  They have an amazing selection of meats and cheeses to chose from, which only makes it better.  I made a Buffalo chicken breast with chipotle gouda, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on rye the other day, and it was amazing.  Just trust me, and go get one!Hot Meals:  There are different daily specials of grinders, sandwiches, etc.  Plus, in the summer, they have an entire grill menu.  Pretty cool!Pizza Slices ($2):  This is what truly warmed my heart over.  For whatever reason, all of the delis near me in NYC had secret pizza ovens in the back of the store, and people would fight to get some amazing pizza out of the oven.  While this pizza isn't hidden in the back, I was super excited nonetheless!  What is better than a fresh slice of pizza?  And they'll throw it back in the oven for you to heat it up.  It's not the greatest pizza, but it's decent.Cold Prepared Foods:  Lots of cold "salads" to choose from (i.e. Ham Salad, Chicken Salad, etc.).  They are sold by the pound so make sure to think about what you order.  I got a delicious pasta salad with tortellini, but tortellini is heavy.  A single scoop was $3 and not quite worth it.  However, the ham salad was $5.99/pound and quite delicious!Take Home Prepared Meals:  There is a refrigerator with pre-made salads, pasta dinners, and other choices toward the front of the store as well.Convenience Store:  So there is all of this food, but you can also stop here for all of your basic necessities.  Laundry detergent, snacks, sodas, and basic household needs are all here!All of this and friendly employees too?  You bet!  There is a minimum purchase of $5 to use a credit card, but that seems reasonable to me.Ok, Yelpers!  Don't let me down.  UFC this review up, go visit the store, and send some love to the Food Shoppe!
Mandarin Express=I was on the Eastside late one night way out in BFE Sunrise Manor visiting a friend. We grew hungry and were craving Chinese/Mandarin food. I looked up Yelp and found Mandarin Express. I am glad we did because the service, delivery and food was Outstanding! We ordered crab rangoons, war won ton soup, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and house special chicken.The food was very hot and fresh upon delivery which was Fantastic, they don't mess around with delivery. lolA full belly is a happy belly :)
Big Jim's Restaurant & Bar=My friend said this place was on triple D and he wanted to try it so we ended up going.  Big Jim's in the Run is essentially right in the middle of a residential zone.  It doesn't really feel like you are walking into a business at first because of the area you drove through to get there.  You will most likely end up parking on the street in front of somebody's home nearby.This place has what I call quintessential "American Italian".  What that means is that it's not necessarily Italian but rather Americanized Italian food which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's just not the same.  The first thing you will notice is that the decor is very simple.  This place is the last "D" in the title of the show, "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives".  This place is a dive and it's part of the charm of the place.  They are not trying to be anything outside of what they are besides themselves which is what makes this place genuine.  The servings at this place are really large in that one dish can maybe feed 2 people.  If each of your party orders a dish you will most likely not finish your meal.  The salads are huge, the bread comes to the table at first the entrees will fill you up big time.  The food at the same time is good as well.  The lasagna has A LOT of ricotta in it... almost too much.  The veal sandwich I ordered was almost the size of the plate!  All that being said it's not a lot of money for a lot of food.  While it's not the greatest Italian food I've had it's one of the better American Italian food places I've eaten at and I can't say you leave hungry because the portions are beyond generous to the point of being family sized.The service was very welcoming and friendly.If you follow me on the rest of my social media (HITTofMCM) then you've been waiting for this review.  I know that you come to Yelp to find out about the actual product, the Food, and I'll get to that, but Big Jims isn't just about the food no matter how good it is, it's about what this place stands for.Living in Pittsburgh my whole life I can't believe I've never been.  The building has been in the GreenField Run since the early 1900's but the restaurant opened in 1977.  I've eaten at a lot of places, I've BEEN to a lot of places, but sitting in Big Jims waiting for my food I couldn't help but feel at home, even a bit emotional from the love oozing from this place.  I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having a gentlemen by the name of Scott serve me my Bahama Mama.  He started there in 1997 and said he could never see himself working for anyone else even before they appeared on the famous food show DINERS, DRIVE INS AND DIVES.  He asked me about myself and what I do and I told him about IM SO BURGH and other things all while he tended to everyone who was there and everyone who came in as if they were all one big family.  He knew everyone by name, he knew what some people wanted before they ordered it and he and all the staff operated in a way that wasn't overly friendly and fake but, honest a bit exhausted from life and always with a smile just like it would be at home after a long day.  I told him all my Facebook family encouraged me to come here after I posted how I wanted the best Reuben Sandwich I could find in the city of Pittsburgh.  While I waited for the food he pointed out they are going through a bit of a revitalization getting new carpet put in, painting tiles and changing walls as if it was renovations in his own home.  He pointed out photos of before they were open and a big portrait of Big Jim himself looking all Tony Soprano.  He appeared to be a man who got respect and gave it just the same.  If I based this review alone on my experience and atmosphere it would get 5 stars but then my food came and as I write this, I wish Yelp had a 6 star system.My Reuben entered my place at the bar like a prize winning champion.  The Rye bread was toasted just enough to give it that crisp texture but not too much.  The sauerkraut and Swiss was just right and the thousand island dressing was just enough to marinate and flavor but the star of any Reuben is the meat and this didn't disappoint.  Thinly shaved, grilled just right with not a moment of chewiness or toughness it melted in your mouth all the way to the last bite.  Everything on the sandwich played its role like a team of ingredients should, and just in case I liked a little more Thousand Island, without even asking Scott made sure I had it right by my plate.  Each bite made me a little bit more sad because I knew it was coming to an end.  Like a night out with good friends that you wish lasted forever, that's how I felt about my closing time with this Reuben, Scott and Big Jims as a whole.I'll be back.  I promised them that. Once to take my woman to dinner and a third time to spread the word with friends.  The fourth time though, I'll need another solo visit to recapture that first visit feel all over again.  If you're from Pittsburgh or just visiting skip the chain places and head to Big Jims, they have something for everyone.Big Jim's is one of my dad's favorite places in Pittsburgh, and we ended up going here a few weeks ago.  I'm not much of a dive girl, but I actually liked this place a lot.  Located under a bridge in Greenfield, this unassuming bar puts out some massive portions at low prices.I ordered an Italian sub, and my dad got the Veal Parmesan sandwich.  I had some buyer's remorse, as my Italian sub was good but not special, and the veal parm was amazing.  The veal piece was huge and the sandwich was delicious.  They do love their condiments here so ask them to go light if you roll that wayThe service here is really pleasant and homey.  Not forced but nice.  It's a very old-school-Pittsburgh-y kind of restaurant.Once arriving, my brother pointed out that they had been on Triple D.  Who knew?  (Apparently, a lot of people on Yelp, that's who.)After cycling past Big Jim's hundreds of times over the past couple of years, I finally paid a visit this past Sat. evening at 6:30.  When a friend who enjoys large portions on the cheap wanted to go somewhere for dinner, Amanda J.'s review from last week reminded me of Big Jim's, so I suggested that we try it.Although I've always noticed several cars nearby, I was surprised at how busy it was when we stopped by.  We had to wait for a table, but we were seated in only about 5 min.  In looking at the drink menu, I noticed a cocktail called the Big Jim's cidre which appeared to be a spiced apple cider-like drink, so I decided to try it ($7.50).  I'm glad that I did, since it tasted just like a spiced apple cider with a buzz, complete with a cinnamon stick and cinnamon sugar on the rim.  It was delicious, and I could drink them all day (and night), but as it were, I showed some restraint and stuck to one.For food, I decided to go with the open faced turkey sandwich ($10.99), since the weather was cool and wet and I was in the mood for some comfort food.  It consisted of sliced roast turkey on bread and fries covered with gravy.  It reminded me vaguely of a similar roast turkey special that my college cafeteria used to serve, minus the mashed potatoes.  Nevertheless, it was pretty tasty, and definitely hit the spot for comfort food.  The one major drawback was the fries, which were clearly fried in old oil, given that they had a bitter taste.  Fortunately, the gravy helped to mask the bitterness, though.  My friend ordered the large fish sandwich ($9.99), which consisted of two huge pieces of fish on a large bun, as well as a large side of cole slaw.  The cole slaw was of the creamy variety, and contained so much mayo that it formed a pool as he ate the slaw.  He ate 75% of the fish and the bun, which impressed me, given the portion size.  Like most customers, we both took home leftovers.Overall, I was generally pleased with my experience at Big Jim's.  The clientele was definitely on the older side, and struck me as mostly consisting of Greenfield locals.  As others have said, this isn't an ideal date location due to the (lack of) decor, but it's perfectly fine for a casual dinner of comforting food on the cheap.  I'm awarding 3.5 stars because of the gross fries, but if Big Jim's could solve this problem, I'd go with a 4 instead.  While I probably won't rush back soon, I enjoyed my meal and would return the next time I'm in the mood for comfort food.
HoneyBaked Ham=OK so this Christmas I decided to make things easy for myself in the cooking department, considering I just cooked a full on feast for Thanksgiving.I decided to have a Honeybaked ham for my Christmas dinner and I will make all of the delicious sides which would be simple!The Ham was delicious, picked it up the day before Christmas, yes waited in a 40 minute line, I was expecting that so no shock, lol.It was $38 bucks for a ham that fed 8 people a generous portion, I think it was a great deal for taste, price and convenience.You don't even have to bake or heat it up, simply pull it out and let it rest for an hour and you are ready to go. That is key that you serve this ham at room temperature!I suggest making your own sides as they are costly and in my opinion their sides are not as good as what you can do on your own. They are called Honeybaked ham for a reason and that is what you should buy :)All I had to do was my sides, green beans and bacon, brown sugar baked yams, and scalloped potatoes. It was an easy Holiday dinner and it left a lot more time for talking, snapping pics and laughing with family and friends!I will be doing a repeat of this next year for my Christmas dinner!!!I am a very happy customer!Let's get one thing straight: I am not a fan of warm ham. Thanksgiving is for turkey, not spiral-sliced. But this place is a great spot to grab lunch. Sandwiches are huge, soups are good (particularly the potato and the ham/cheese), and they have several grab and go items as well.Join their e-club for a coupon for a free ham sandwich- it's gigantic, probably what killed Mama Cass. You'll get another on your birthday. This particular location has a Yelp check-in offer for a free soda + chips, so grab a cup of soup and this can easily make two lunches for under $4. I feel like the turkey is even better than their namesake ham sando, but they're both large and fresh. The ham has a honey-mustard sauce that adds just the right amount of sweetness.Service is polite, location is clean. I won't line up around the block to buy a full size ham here, but it's not bad for lunches. They also have pies and various condiments/seasonings for sale as well.Thanksgiving shopping is DONE! We went to HoneyBaked early Sunday afternoon and got the ham and the turkey and a few fixings. Very helpful staff who walked us through what we wanted and helped us determine the right quantities. It sure isn't cheap though!This stuff doesn't have to be bought the day before, ya know? You can get it a little earlier because the line tends to grow as the holidays approach.
Mr. K's Soft Ice Cream & Drive In=I have a very large soft spot for locally owned and operated restaurants. And this is exactly what this place is. There isn't a large parking lot or fancy entrance when you walk in. As soon as you walk in you find yourself in a tight, but yet roomy diner. Don't expect the fancy decorations or big puffed booths. You came here to get your food and eat. And that experience is worth paying for (and by paying I mean little).Nothing fancy on the menu, yet they maintain an interesting blend of options to keep you coming back. You have your burger and hot dog combos and the daily specials on their own whiteboard. The food is all reasonably priced and a combo can run for about $5.50.I came during dinner and found the place filled with construction workers covered in paint to parents eating with their ketchup faced children. I find this to be the real magic of the diner. A place where the white and blue collared can eat together without that feeling you get in some other places meant for a particular cohort. Finding a seat wasn't a problem though, so if you want to grab a seat and eat, no worries. I can imagine during the non-winter season that many people will want to eat outside on the picnic benches before catching the light rail uptown.The hot dogs and fries didn't give my taste buds anything new to think about either. There really isn't anything special about the food. It's the atmosphere and price you go here for. It's quick and pleasing service. That feeling that these owners actually give a two cents about their restaurant and reputation in the community. That's why you go here. I have yet to try their seemingly famous ice cream, so I will update when appropriate. Four stars for quality and service. Sure it isn't the best food, but it's local and a part of Charlotte.Ah, what's not to love about a good ol' Charlotte staple?!It was about time I made it in here; I'd bookmarked it months ago and literally drive by it all the time. So let's just say I was more than pumped to finally give them a try. Based on previous reviews I was ready to be amazed. And they didn't let me down! Mr. K's is said to have some of the best burgers, fries and milkshakes in town. After you fight your way to a premium parking spot (be warned parking is extremely limited) the diner itself is small.  You walk right into the grill and counter where you order. There are a few booths but when this place is super busy I'd say plan to either wait for a table or get it to go!  But a plus is that they do have some outdoor seating which I'd definitely recommend for the warmer months. I ordered a chili dog, fries and a chocolate milkshake. I just can't think of a better combination! Seriously. Chili Dog: Delish! Just enough chili and toppings to NOT leave the bun wet. You can get slaw on your dog but I opted out of that, I'm still not a fan of slaw. (I know, I know since I'm in NC I need to get used to it) Fries: Dropped HOT each order. They were hot crispy goodness. Just like they should be! Next time, I'll have to try their infamous onion rings. Milkshake: Creamy. Chocolate. Goodness. Yep. Order it every time. They have a good amount of variety of other flavors if chocolate isn't your thing but I'd make sure not to leave without having one. It was a pretty good meal. I enjoyed it and left satisfied. I can definitely see myself here a few times in the upcoming months!Coronary burger with a side of frings. Of course, the burger loaded and on an onion bun because... why not?The burger was excellent. Decent beef in there and cooked properly. Cheese, onion, tomato, ketchup and mayo. All the proper toppings for a proper burger.As much as I wanted to have one, I opted to skip the milkshake. Maybe next time, I'll drop the fries and go with the shake instead.Service was good. Be warned that they put a lot of ice in the sodas, but they do give free refills.If you're looking for a locally owned, friendly, old fashion place for a burger, hot dog or ice cream, this is the place to stop!. I've done their dogs, burgers and corn dogs so far. Still haven't actually had the ice cream. Go figure. Inexpensive but good. Friendly and fast. When I get a craving for a good grilled dog, this is my go to spot. I'm a fan for sure!I must have just not ever hit post.  There is no way that I have not reviewed this place before.  A big K, onion rings, and a shake.  I've been doing it since I was a kid.  This was literally the place where I realized that some places were just better than others in the foodie world.This no frills diner that is located next door to a strip club may not look like much from the road, but do yourself a favor and just go have a bite.  If you're looking for healthy food, go across the street to Luna's.The Big K is pretty much their version of the Wopper.  Its just better.  If I just left the gym, I might make it a double.  They have plenty of other options in general such as chili dogs, as well as diverse daily specials.There isn't table side service, but the service is plenty friendly.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
Sushi On Rainbow=This place has been open for so long! It might have been my first AYCE sushi too! I used to go here to satisfy my craving for tons of sushi, until I discovered Sushi Mon (which is closer to my work). This place still holds true though. The last time I went the fish was still fresh and the rolls were still delicious. The only complaint about this restaurant now is the location and the size of the place. The bathrooms aren't all that clean either.Location: This is definitely my sushi joint everyone has their own well this place is mine! I love the urban feel of this place. Its like a hole in the wall no one really knows about it but every body loves it. Like its your own secret spot :) Customer Service: is great! the servers are older Japanese women so they really treat you like their own. The chef is hilarious! Definitely if you sit at the bar expect some laughs. Food: is delicious if you love baked muscles with yum yum sauce on them this place is the best. I've tried Goyemons, sushi factory, Kaya etc and I've compared all none of them beat sushi on rainbows style. I love their Nigiri portions, big slices and little rice! Price: Great, definitely the cheapest AYCE dinner I've found and their lunch specials bento boxes are a great deal. You get so much food for $7!Being half Japanese & growing up in Japan I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi or any Japanese restaurant. Sushi on Rainbow did not disappoint. My friends indulged in my cravings and agreed to eat sushi. Not familiar with any sushi places in Vegas and one of the rare moments my friends have EVER asked me to jump on Yelp & find a place, I was stoked! Usually when I whip out my phone and start yelping it's amongst groans and moans from them. "Emy put the phone down!" "Seriously dude, do you have to yelp everything???" Sometimes I would Yelp while walking and a few times almost face planted into something. Though my friends were annoyed with my constant Yelping, they were nice enough to guide me while I was walking and typing. So yea, I was pretty happy they were turning to YELP for suggestions. This was my moment to either shine or worse - tank. Sushi on Rainbow was close to where we were at and the Yelp reviews were pretty good so I threw caution to the wind and announced, "I found the perfect place!". Fingers crossed and a silent prayer to the Yelp gods, we walk into SOR and was immediately greeted with "irrashaimase" in the right pronunciation...yeeesss, there is a Yelp god! It was AYCE sushi and other Japanese dishes such as tempura, fried oysters, curry rice, katsu etc. As some Yelpers have pointed out there is an hour time limit but this is common in Japan of any AYCE restaurant so this was not a big deal to me. I forgot how much it was per person but I did upload a couple of pics here that have the pricing on it. We all def ate and drank more than our money's worth in the allotted time.The sushi we ordered came out relatively quickly and so did the non-sushi items. I was amazed at all the things they offer for AYCE! It was delish! The night we were there, beer, sake and soft drinks were also included in the AYCE eat. After establishing who the DD was (gotta be responsible ppl) we all ordered sake.  The sushi chef's were very friendly and personable so were the waitresses. The sushi chefs would call out from time to time to ask us how we were doing. Like I said, very friendly. One of the waitresses was from my hometown in Japan and lived about 10 mins from me. It was fun talking to her in Japanese especially since my friends hardly ever hear me speak it. So yea, I got to bust out my Japanese...lol. Ok getting side tracked. I can't remember everything we ordered but the sushi was very fresh. I always start with hamachi (don't know what it's called in English) and it was very good. Salmon and maguro followed. Plus spicy tuna and a few speciality rolls. Also ordered the shrimp tempura, fried oysters and tonkatsu (pork cutlet). Yes, I'm a little oinker! One hour was plenty of time for us to fill our bellies on endless sushi and sake. Like I mentioned we hardly had to wait and the restaurant was a bit busy. The sushi counter was full when we got there and there were 3 tables that were occupied. The 2 sushi chefs both from Japan, were making the sushi and the cooks in the back were making the other dishes, This will be MUST GO TO restaurant every time I go to Vegas. Oh and btw, one of the sushi chefs was wearing a UH cap and told me they get lots of customers from Hawaii. As for converting my friends to Yelp that's another issue lol. I did score some big points on this once. (Fist pump!) Oh wait, I did convert one person, who just set up an account!If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi & food this place is the place to go. I've been to other Japanese restaurants in Vegas that were highly recommended by locals only to be disappointed that it wasn't authentic. I mean come on, shrimp tempura is not panko crusted shrimp...that's called shrimp fry. So glad I found this place thanks to Yelp. 1 point Emy / 0 points friends who I will eventually convert to becoming Yelpers. BwuahahahaCame on a Sunday for lunch. I know a lot of sushi places around the area are NOT opened for lunch. (what's up with that yo!? Can't a girl get her sushi during the day!?!) So with that said, being that Sushi On Rainbow was open for lunch automatically gave this place a 3 star. This may look like a "hole in the wall" but it satisfied my sushi fix.No trills, no frills....just come in and get your Japanese food/sushi on. The regular rolls on the menu ranges from $5-6 and each order comes with 8 rolls. The special rolls comes with two and it ranges from $8-12. Not sure if other places around the area have lunch specials on the weekend (we came on a Sunday) but this place does. My boyfriend got a beef lunch special box that comes with miso soup, salad, beef (duh), a generous portion of rice, and half an orange for your daily serving of fruit. This was $8.95 I think. And he got full off of this....so good adult sized meal. Service was great to us. Our nice little Japanese grandma took our order. I didn't know there was a lunch special for the Cali rolls and Spicy Tuna rolls that I ordered. Instead of keeping her mouth shut and just placing my order in, she told me it would be cheaper if i just got the lunch special price and it comes with my choice of soup or salad. How nice of her to tell me =) Throughout our lunch, the waitresses kept coming by to refill our drinks as well as asking how everything was.The bill turned out to be around $21 (tips not included) This may be my go-to sushi place from now on.Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting décor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a "secret menu" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is "Omakase" and they take care of everything for me. I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.3 strikes your out!It pains me to write this review, my heart actually aches.  I wanted to love this place in fact we went back 3 times to give it a shot, I don't normally do that. Sadly we left in heartbreak and will never go back.We have been to Japan, Sushi capital of the world.  We are not professionals but have traveled the world.  I have respect for those who carry that tradition over to our side of the pond.  The owner is amazing his cuts are exactly where they should be  the fish are precisely cut the rice is also perfect, he is amazing.So all that going.  Great!  well not so much.  We were treated horribly after our first trip. When we sat at the bar the owner served us the sushi was great.   The next 2 times not so much we were pushed off to the sideline. This time was busier we sat at his bar his sidekick took care of us.  Sushi is not all about the fish is is about the service, presentation and cut.  This individual had none.  No service. No presentation. and the cuts were horrible.  Fish was slopped all over the place no design or pride it looked like a serial killer left a crime scene.We wanted the owner to wait on us but it seemed he was always busy with his vips.  We Will NEVER be back.Treat everyone good and your place will be filled.  Treat one person badly and your place will be empty.  Three times you're done...Sushi on Rainbow-located next to Greenland Market. They have a sign that boldly states "Since we adhere to strict Japanese standards, our food costs are higher than other establishments which follow lesser standards" which sounds promising. Unfortunately, this place is underwhelming in many aspects.How to get any service at Sushi on Rainbow:1. Walk in and find your own seat2. If lucky enough they will swing by to ask for a drink. Tell them your drink order immediately as they rudely slap their menu on the table3. Order won't be taken unless you wave your hands.  Hands in the air, reach for the stars or imagine yourself being a butterfly trying to reach the heaven. You will get their attention eventually.FOODAs I said earlier, their sign posted all over the establishment is very deceiving. I have ordered Sushi 4 You and Sushi Combo for 2. Fish never taste fresh and this is a fact based on +20 visits. AYCE is $22.95 for lunch (with 45min limit) and $26.95 for dinner (with 60min limit). Way overpriced for their low quality items. On one of the visit, I decided to order Katsudon which turned out to be a total fail. First, it took over 30mins to get to the table. Perfect! Everyone in my group is done with their food while me and my starving stomach are waiting for the food ever since the dinosaurs existed. Finally my katsudon comes to the table and all I see is some crusty rice with katsu (breading falling apart) and egg...overall presented like a vomit. Not appetizing at all. Too much dashi or sauce used for this. Never again. CONCLUSIONI rather pay that amount at Sakana for their superior quality and fast/attentive service.
Sante'=Structurally, the restaurant is quite charming - in a row of buildings on the national register of historic places, lots of exposed brick and tin ceilings.Lunch service is "leisurely" - not quite slow, but certainly not at a pace that will get you back to the office in an hour.The menu always underwhelms me though.  Not sure if it wants to be french (see the cheese plate appetizer which is large enough to be an entree), southwestern (several items are infused with chiles, corn, avocado or black beans) or something else.  This is a place we go once or twice a year as a change of pace.  But I can't seem to find anything compelling to bring me here more often - although I'd like to find one!Note to either server or kitchen - if the soup of the day is a Shellfish Gumbo, why put calamari in it?  Or has calamari become a shellfish?
Roberto's Taco Shop=I once drove around for an hour trying to find this Roberto's. A little nicer and cleaner than other Roberto's but the food is the same no matter which Roberto's you stop in at. Best meal at 3am when you're belligerently drunk trying to find your way home. They always mess up my order. But whatever they give me, I finish it all. I heart the steak nacho's with extra salsa and sour cream. The best deal is the crunchy chicken taco with a chicken enchilada combo. I love how they stuff the taco with loads of shredded chicken, a little lettuce and tons of cheese.  The enchilada compliments it quite nicely.  The guacamole is processed but what the "o lay" do you expect for great mexican food at these cheap prices? Skip the beans, they aint  that great either. Tacos, enchilada's, nacho's, burrtio's, you can't go wrong ordering any of these.  Don't even think about going to Taco hell.I hear if you flash em in the drive through, it's free.
Beehive Coffee=I won't say this a lot....but I felt slightly out of my element here.  I feel like The Beehive has probably hosted many area teenagers over the years.  Most of those teens have probably made their mark, literally, on the walls and tables of this place.  But alas, I am a teen no more.  Just trying to keep "hippity hop" like the rest of those youngins.  So for me, it's just not that type of place I can get into.  For others I'm sure it is.  Possibly a place that gets better at night...when you involve a dimly lite room, alcohol and karaoke.  Keeping it old school...like way old school...they do not take credit card.  A little irritating but I do understand that those transactions cost the owners money and I want to support the local biz scene. I did appreciate the incredibly friendly service I received from the Barista and the delicious Apple Cinnamon Iced Tea I drank in like five seconds.  I'd come back solely based on the service and to try the food.  I just don't know if I'd spend an extended period of time to say work...I may be too distracted people watching!I always hate to do this, but I feel the need to update my previous review and deduct a star in light of my experience here this past Sat.  Although I'd been to the Beehive several times before, I never realized that this coffee shop has a split personality. How, you ask?  Well, as I learned this weekend, past 10pm on Sat. (and presumably Fri., as well), the Beehive serves as overflow for the bar next door (the Rowdy Buck), which is presumably owned by the same owners.I learned about the Hyde side of the Beehive's personality when CM and I, who'd been there since around 8:30pm, were unexpectedly carded by a bouncer from the bar next door at 10pm.  CM, confused, pointed out that we were sipping on hot (non-alcoholic) beverages, to which the bouncer responded that he had to card us, per the rules of the establishment.  We obligingly got out our IDs, but were confused as to the purpose of the carding, since we'd already seen the barista ID someone who ordered a beer at the counter when we ordered our beverages shortly after arrival (the Beehive serves some alcoholic beverages--not sure if this is only during certain hours--but regardless, they were serving long before we were carded).  Soon enough, the reason for the generalized carding became evident, as noisy revelers from the bar wandered in via a doorway between the two establishments to hang out by the barista stand.  Unsurprisingly, as more of them graced the Beehive with their presence, the noise level rose exponentially, driving the people trying to get work done out to seek a quieter and less chaotic refuge.As for the drinks, CM and I were unimpressed.  I ordered the mate latte, which sounded interesting, but tasted rather bland and monotonous.  CM ordered his coffee shop standby, a cafe au lait, and was not a fan, placing it at the bottom of the ranking of the four indie coffeeshops in PGH he's tried it at to date.  I also ordered a slice of the flourless chocolate cake, which, in contrast, was excellent--very moist and chocolatey, without being overly sweet.  However, I'd guess that like most coffee shops, the Beehive procures their desserts from elsewhere--although I may be mistaken, given that their name is actually Beehive Coffee and Dessertery.To make a long story short, I'd recommend avoiding the Beehive after 10pm on Fri. or Sat., when if effectively serves as an overflow hangout for revelers from the bar next door.  At other times, I'd still recommend checking it out for its characteristically quirky ambiance and delicious baked goods, even though it may leave something to be desired in the hot beverage dept.
Mickey & Mooch=Once upon a time, a party of 12 of us descended upon Mickey & Mooch to celebrate the birthday of one of our fair maidens.  Based on the restaurant's décor and lavish entrance, I was surprised to open my menu and found that the pricing on items were pretty reasonable, considering.  I had expected entrees to be higher priced.  However, we soon found that "lower" prices come with many consequences.  Drinks:  After 30 minutes of being seated, some were still waiting for their beverages.  When they finally received their bottles of beer, they were "as is."  No glass.  What kind of "upscale" restaurant serves beer without a glass?  We weren't sitting at the bar; we were in the dining room.  One of the beers was a Blue Moon brought in its bottle.  Don't the bartenders know that Blue Moon is always traditionally served with an orange slice?  It's like serving a lime with a Corona.  Someone else ordered a martini.  It was sloshed around as it was set down in front of him.  He had to wipe up the spillage by himself.  Bread:  Bread was served but it was cold (like it was taken out of a freezer and not fully thawed).  They asked to have the half-frozen bread taken away and replaced with "warm" bread at least twice; it never came during the entire two and a half hours we were there.  Salads:  We asked if we could get something besides a regular garden salad.  Our server advised a Caesar salad or Wedge in its place.  We were never told that there was a significant upcharge to getting a slightly different salad.  $2.95 for the Caesar, $3.95 for the Wedge..the same cost if you ordered them separately.  When this was brought to the attention of our server at the end of the meal, he brushed it off.  I'm guessing it happens a lot at the restaurant.   The salads arrived & we had to ask for silverware (for the 2nd time).  Several minutes passed and I finally got up and swiped them off an empty table.  Minutes after we had started using the newly acquired silverware and eating our salads, the server finally returned...with ONE set of silverware.  I guess we were supposed to share?Entrees:  Our entrees arrived halfway through the salads.  After delving into the entrees, several people had puzzled looks on their faces.  Some had ordered their steaks medium rare or medium.  They came out with raw meat in the middle.  And not just a small portion; it was golfball-sized.  Medium rare means pink with some reddish tones; not raw.  Worse, one person ordered pork.  It, too, had a golfball-sized red raw center.  Trichinosis, anyone?  At this point, we called over a manager.  When the raw pork was displayed to her, she tried to tell us that it was "fat."  Red fat?  In the middle of a pork cut?  Being served the raw pork is one thing.  Passing it off as acceptable by a manager is poor crisis management.  All of the undercooked meats were taken away to "re-cook" or replace.  The steaks were returned within a few minutes; the pork wasn't.  With the plates that were taken away for the steaks were the side items that everyone had ordered.  These were not returned on the plates and had to be "re-ordered" by us specifically requesting them from the server and/or manager.   One friend ordered drawn butter with his salmon.  It didn't come until he was halfway through the salmon, about 15 minutes later.  Halfway through my meal, I finished my glass of wine and ordered another glass.  It didn't come until I was through with my entrée and the plate had been cleared.  Great timing...and I'm not a fast eater.   After everyone finished eating and plates were cleared, the "new" pork finally arrived.  Bill:  Did I mention the Wedge salad that was on my bill after everything we went through and it was brought to the attention of the server that we were never advised about the upcharge?  After all our problems, getting the bill with all the additions was like a kick in the head after being punched in the stomach for a couple of hours.  Summary:  I'm just telling you the story from my side of the table.  I don't even know everything that went on at the other side of the 12-person table.  I only gathered stories here and there.  It wasn't just one error.  It was one after another.  It wasn't just one person at the table.  It was practically everyone who had a problem.  When the numerous errors were brought to their attention, the errors were not handled in an appropriate manner by the waitstaff or the management team.  The biggest problem of the night was that nobody seemed to care whether we had a poor experience or not.  The kicker was that afterwards I wrote a 3-page letter to Mickey & Mooch corporate...and got no response.  They apparently didn't care either.  So I guess they won't care if I take my money elsewhere. The End.  Happily Never After.
Price's Chicken Coop=What a bummer! So I moved to Charlottes Historic Southend last week and knew right away that I had to try the ever-raved about Price's Chicken Coop. I had high expectations- since Ive heard nothing but great things about this place.  I went this Saturday for lunch and ran into a crowd (expected) but I heard the line went fast- and just figured it was a good sign! After about 15 minutes of fully-expected wait time I made my selection the 1/4 lb white chicken meal complete with a roll, hushpuppies, and coleslaw for only $6!I walked down to the Common Market to grab a drink and sit outside to eat my meal- (CM rocks by the way!) ...When I actually ate my chicken I was more than disappointed. While I am never one to completely disregard an eating establishment because its a so-called hole in the wall (as this is) I do expect it to be sanitary. I immediately encountered a large black curly hair (that was definitely not mine) ... I was so disgusted- I put that piece in the garbage and tried to regain some of my appetite  and at least give the other piece a try. The chicken was fairly dry and definitely nothing special. There wasn't a lot of meat at all - and Ive had better chicken at KFC  which isn't saying much. ...The Coleslaw had no carrots or anything and was ok in flavor- basically a sweet watery-mayonnaise shredded cabbage mixture...nothing great. The highlight of the meal were the hushpuppies- which were perfect in every way.I do feel like I will give this one more chance since everyone else claims it's so great...maybe I just had one outlying bad experience.Why the 5 stars you say? Prices never disappoints me. They are ALWAYS consistent. I can actually eat their chicken cold and still be happy. The customer base is super eclectic. The restaurant is subjectively charming and how can you not smile when you see people with shirts and ties sitting on the street curb eating chicken? As we know there isn't anything special about fried chicken. Don't go buying fried chicken expecting some elaborate 20 step preparation process. Its just fried chicken. But fried chicken is comforting for everyone and always induces some type of nostalgia. Its a simple dish and Prices does it right: Moist, tastes like chicken and not overwhelmed with spices or anything, and lastly crispy batter. They don't have real sides here. Just slaw, potato salad, taters and hush puppies. Although they offer other menu items, I only get chicken usually. Gizzards (yuck) are okay here too. =) Thighs are just too greasy for me and breasts are too meaty. I like a 30% meat, 70% skin/batter mixture. So I'm a wing kinda guy and Price's has damn good crispy wings. My only complaint is that they chop off the wing tips. Yes I said it, I love wing tips! I'm still waiting for them to offer fried chicken skin. lolPopped in to give this place a try as I've heard nothing but good things about their chicken. And the raves are correct. This is really good chicken. A meaty chicken breast that was moist with a very crispy batter that wasn't so thick that it overwhelmed the chicken.I got a two piece dinner, which came with a dinner roll, a small tub of cole slaw, some tater tots, some hushpuppies and the previously mentioned chicken - one wing and one breast. The tots were excellent. Not too greasy at all, but I was glad to have the one packet of ketchup for dipping.This was a serious "fried" plate. If they could fry the cold slaw and the dinner roll, I'll bet they would have done so.Note: This place is TAKE OUT ONLY. There is no dining area that I could see.Thinking about eating here? Consider this first. The owner of Price's is likely the scummiest businessperson in the United States that I have had the displeasure of knowing existed. Sure, his chicken is actually not bad, but hear me out.If you park in the private lot for Price's after 6pm, YOUR CAR WILL GET BOOTED OR TOWED. No exceptions, EVEN FOR CUSTOMERS. It's absurd to think that there are people like this in a first world country who would hire his own towing truck service in order to extort people, including his actual customers, out of $50.If you care just one bit about where your money goes, DO NOT EAT HERE.
Barriques=2 stars. 3 stars. 2 stars. 3 stars. 2 stars. 3 stars. 2 stars. 3 stars. 2 stars. 3 stars. 2 stars. 3 stars.3 stars. I usually ignore stars on here and go straight for the meat, the review itself, so I would urge you to do the same. Here are some things Barriques has going:1. Darn good iced coffee. 2. You don't have to sign a CC merchant copy.3. Uhm wine wall anyone? 4. Get a slice of pumpkin chocolate chip bread. Really. 5. You know that wine wall?Here are some things that need attention: 1. Been three times, each time tables were dir-tay. (That's dirty with attitude). 2. Floor needs a scrubbin'. 3. After I wash my hands in the men's room, I want to wash my hands.(notice a theme?)My vote... go for the iced coffee, wine wall, pumpkin chocolate chip bread, wine wall, wine wall, and the wine wall and take your goods to go. Yo.
Pizza Patron===A Slice Of You==A romantic comedy by Jetta(The dimly lit pavement of a strip mall parking lot. JETTA, a glamazon in her early twenties, stares longingly into the night. An alluring ingenue with a dark and questionable past, she shivers in 90 degree night, tears forming in her eyes. Behind her is PIZZA PATRON, a tall, fedora-wearing gentleman. He sports a mustache that doesn't play by the rules. JETTA knows he is behind her.)JETTAI'm sorry. I just can't.PIZZA PATRONWhy can't you let me love you, Jetta?JETTABecause there's nothing left of me to love. I've been burned before. Lured by promises of reasonably priced large one-toppings and hearty, flavorful hot wings. Only to be given hot plates of garbage and crunchy and disturbingly misshapen wings of what I can imagine were once, long before growth hormones, in fact chickens. I don't known if I can trust you.PIZZA PATRONBut I'm not like the others.JETTAThey all say that. I like you, PP. I like your logo depicting a Federale whose about to cut me open and empty my stomach of all that cocaine I spent all morning stuffing in. I like how you scream "PIZZA PATRON!" at the top of your lungs to me whenever I step in the store. I like your queso sticks and chorizo-topped pizza. I even like how you accept pesos in lieu of dollars, no matter how many shithead right-wingers boycott and protest your storefront. Don't you see? I like you. If I open my heart to you, I could risk hating you. Can't we just settle for "like"?PIZZA PATRONWhat would be the point? Why offer a 4.99 large one-topping if the box isn't going to litter your living room floor. Why offer lime and pepper-flavored chicken wings if I can't know that somewhere, it's you're lips sucking the meat off the bone? Don't you see, Jetta? Without you taking advantage of my ridiculously underpriced food, there'd be no reason to make it in the first place. I don't know how else to say this--JETTAShhh. You had me at "$4.99 one topping". (The two embrace. Music plays dramatically in the background.)Somebody put a stop to me. Please.Actually the $3.99 pizza from Pizza Patron looked pretty darn good when I opened the box. It was hot but I noticed immediately, no pizza aroma! Adequate amount of pepperonis and cheese and the crust looked good too but had absolutely no flavor...none! Like a generic pizza..Possible imitation cheese, pepperonis, sauce and dough. I sprinkled copious amounts of garlic salt/powder and crushed red peppers all over it to give it some flavor. I guess if you don't mind doing that it's worth $3.99. Prob better to go across the street to Little Caesar's for $4.99! The star is for me and my seasoning additions! Haha Could give another star for convenience but parking is bad!
Nau-Ti-Gal=This is near our house, so we like to pop in. The outdoor seating is great in summer, and the tropical menu is fun on a cold, winter day.Food is okay. Nothing I particularly crave between visits, but it is nicer than most waterfront joints where you can park a boat. I do enjoy the house salad. Strangely, it comes with a little side cup of chocolate chip cookie dough. I don't know why they include this, especially since cookie dough contains raw egg (I'm surprised there isn't some code they are violating), but I happen to love chocolate chip cookie dough and I can't wait to eat it with my salad.I tried something different tonight: curry chickpea and lentil stew. It was pretty good! I can't stand cilantro and was able to order the entree without it.My husband had a massive cheeseburger, which he loved. I can attest the fries were great as well. They leave some skin on and use a lot of salt. Yum.Now for the reasons this is a two star review instead of higher:The outdoor seating process is a complete cluster. If you enter the front door at the hostess stand and ask for an outside table, they tell you to go outside to be seated. OK, no problem. We'll go outside.Outside, we were told all tables were full and to go INSIDE to get a pager from the hostess. We saw open tables near the outdoor bar and asked if we could eat at those tables. The waitress said those were first come, first serve, and we could eat dinner there. She was very friendly about it, "Yes, they'll give you menus there and take care of you, but you just have to order from the bartender because there is no table service."We were good with that and grabbed a table. I went to the bar for menus and I was told we could only order appetizers in the bar section. I explained the waitress had just told us we could order off the full menu. Bartender's response: "Oh, was that the one in the orange shirt?" Me: "No, it was someone in a blue shirt." I'm not sure why that mattered but should not have been the response. Bartender says we have to go inside for a pager to get a table. By this time more customers are ahead of us in line. On a Saturday night, every place we'd visit with patio seating would be busy, so we decided to get a pager and wait.I get a pager from the inside hostess stand. I will skip writing about the conversation between the hostess and the waitresses since this review is getting long. However, I will note the person who had just told me we could order off the full menu at the outdoor bar was there and I told her we had just learned we had to get a regular table to order from the full menu. Her reply, "Oh, sorry, I forgot."We then go back to the outside bar to wait for the pager to buzz.Surprisingly, it only took about 10 minutes for a table to become available. I go back to the outdoor hostess stand, walking by one of the three open tables we'll be seated at, and the waitress tells me I have to take my pager back inside before she will seat me. I just about lost my mind at this point!!! I keep my head cool and level, despite my frustration. I walk BACK into and through the restaurant to drop off the pager. The hostess says thanks and tells me to go back outside and find a waitress to seat us. Restaurant Manager: if you read this review, please fix this process! All the burden of finding a table is on your customers. Hire a real hostess for outside and either give her a stack of pagers or have her commit to memory who is on the wait list. I cannot believe how disorganized this was. The Nau-ti-Gal owners have owned restaurants in Madison for decades. This is rookie performance.
Vanloi Chinese Barbecue Restaurant=Ohhh yes. My kind of place. Raggedy, but some pretty delicious duck. I'm an avid patron of this 'restaurant' as I come here and order full ducks often. If you have never had duck, I would recommend you to try it out as its just tasty.Anyways lets get to it. This place is located right off central in a little corner across the street from the gas station and such. It's a very small spot as its truly just a take out spot. Not quite a dine in place. They have pretty authentic Chinese dishes as when you go in you can see their menu of some bizarre things. Also, I wanted to note their sanitary score. Even though its an A, it's not an high A. I think it's not bad considering what they prepare. Stick to the duck, and you will have no issues. The prices are very reasonable as I have been to other duck restaurants and it seemed to be really expensive.Overall, this place is a pretty good place for some authentic duck with a reasonable price. Take out, take home, and eat it with rice or bread... Awesome.
Brad's Fish & Chips=Brads is cheap and the fish and sides are all frozen pre-breaded. I pop thru the drive thru every now and then because its cheap and easy and on my way home.The catfish is OK. it's thin and flat? Never saw a flat catfish before. Not a lot of flavor. This is normal for Brad's trust my ex used to get the fish and fried zucchini all the time. I do like their tarter sauce it is tasty. It's weird if you go in they have all of these display cases to sell you trinkets from Asia. But looks a little like a cafeteria. They have everything fried you can think of. Fish, shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings, fries you get the idea. If you want great catfish go to Honey bears on central Thursdays or Fridays only.We have been going to Brads for over 15 years. It really has not changed much. The interior is blah.The staff is strange yet nice.The food is ok to good. Everything is breaded and fried but the breading is good. The cod fillet was meaty and good.  It was just too much grease after the rings and fish. It was 27 for 4 of us...not too bad.
Las Glorias Grill=I was hekka hungry today and my friend suggested we go here. We rounded up the apartment troops and hopped in his Hummer around 8pm. There was no wait and we were the last ones to come in just before closing. I was a bit worried since it was a party of 8 and it was so late but we basically ended up with the 2 servers to ourselves after the rest of the customers left. 99 cent margaritas all summer!! WTH and they were not in miniature glasses either!! OMG I saw customers with mi cheladas and other giant margs. Their chips were fresh and hot not greasy or salty. The salsa could have used more bite to it but the kids enjoyed it as well as the bean dip that I couldn't stop eating. My friends son had the waitress's wrapped around his finger they were very attentive and kept stopping to get kisses from the little guy. The men had the carne asada plates that were ginormous and left nothing behind. I had the enchiladas suiza's and my partner in crime had the fajitas. Mine was good there wasnt really any heat to it but the chicken was cooked perfect. It was all really good I cant wait till I'm hungry again for leftovers. The little ones had pizza's and fries it kept them entertained and their meals included ice cream for dessert. I was really impressed by how nice the staff was way after closing time and they never made us feel like we needed to hurry. They made sure the margs were constantly flowing. The menu had everything but tamales I think. I will be going back to try this hibiscus infused marg it sounded delish!! Party of 8 the bill came to $107 not bad at all! P.S. If you happen to like Coronas they are $1.25 on Tuesdays.During my mercado shopping day this week my husband was craving Mariscos ala Mexico and our pal Tom knew just the place. This little hole in the wall has all the right signs as you walk in the clientele is made up  of a wide slice of phoenix from  your  people on office lunch breaks , abuelas  with their famillias  and average types like myself.  We ordered seafood inspired Mexican food like shrimp enchiladas  , fish tacos (good but nothing to start a talk thread about )  and sopa de mariscos ..very tasty!   The chips were very fresh and the guacamole and salsas mucho yummo.     word of warning they put a jalepeno butter on just about every entree, for those that dont know oil  spreads the heat in peppers ..so your food is spicy!I will definitely be back again  to try the sopa again .
Houlihan's=Why is Laura M., PGH's intrepid reviewer of hidden gem, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, reviewing a chain casual dining restaurant like Houlihan's?  Well, like many people, I ended up at Houlihan's at the behest of a friend (who I hadn't seen for months) for her birthday, along with a large group. (Said friend received a $15 off coupon for her birthday, hence her incentive to come.)  Quite frankly, I came for the company, with low expectations for the food, and those expectations were met.As soon as we walked in, I noticed a strange, slightly unpleasant smell that I couldn't quite put my finger on, which I later determined to be emanating from the restroom.  We stood at the hostess stand for several minutes before someone acknowledged us, and then we waited several more minutes while she put some tables together, during which time we were awkwardly greeted by another hostess. When we were finally seated, we inquired about the happy hour, and our waitress told us that we had to go to the bar to purchase drinks and apps at the happy hour price.  So, we awkwardly got up a few at a time to get our drinks, and ended up getting regular apps.  Per the bartender's recommendation, I got the raspberry long island iced tea ($5.75, HH price), which I thought was a glass, but turned out the be a liter.  Though I've never had a long island before and don't have any standard of judgment, it was cloyingly sweet and wasn't strong at all, since I didn't feel tipsy in the slightest even after drinking the entire liter.  I tried several different variants ordered by my friends, and they were all very sweet and not very strong--the only drink I thought had a better balance was the angry orchard cocktail.For food, we ordered several appetizers to share between us: parmesan frites, "shrooms," and pretzel sticks.  They were all predictably mediocre and salty, with little depth of flavor.  In particular, I was not a fan of the bier cheese, which had a strange aftertaste, or the horseradish sauce incorporated into the shrooms.  For my entree, I ordered the quiche Lorraine with a cup of potato soup, which came with it ($11.95).  To my surprise, the potato soup wasn't salty--if anything, it was bland and underseasoned, such that I added some salt and pepper to spice it up.  The quiche was okay, but nothing very special--I'd definitely had much better renditions elsewhere.  I felt that the amount of food that I received for the price was lacking.  Several other members of our group ordered flatbreads, including my friend who sat next to me, who ordered the gluten free version.  Her flatbread was served at room temperature, such that she sent it back to the kitchen to be warmed up.  To their credit, the kitchen remade it and the manager comped it--but at the end of the day, this shouldn't have happened in the first place.Needless to say, I was less than impressed with the quality of food and drinks that I received from Houlihan's, especially given the price (total check: around $20 w/ tip), not to mention that you have to pay for parking (you're looking at around $5 for a couple of hours).  I'd never been to a Houlihan's before, and to be honest, I doubt I'd return.  There are many restaurants with more character and better--and less expensive--drinks and bar food not far away on East Carson St., including Piper's Pub, Fat Heads, and the Smiling Moose, to name just a few.  Experiences like this are why I always try to talk my friends (and boyfriend!) into trying somewhere new, and avoiding chain casual dining whenever possible, esp. given the richness of the dining scene in PGH.  2.5 stars.
Uncle Sam's Submarines=Last night, upon taking off work, I was super-hungry and was craving a (hot) sandwich, so I decided to head over to Uncle Sam's.  Since most of the menu options appeared to be variations on cheesesteaks, I decided to go with a basic chicken cheesesteak ($8.13 w/ tax), given that I don't eat beef.  From reading other Yelp reviews, I knew the sandwich came with free fries for dine in, so I mentioned that I wanted to do this.When my sandwich and fries came out after about 10 min., they looked very fresh and tempting, so I was excited to dig in.  When I did so, I was underwhelmed, however.  The bread was light and fluffy, rather than substantial, as I prefer, the tomatoes were pretty white, and the chicken was on the tough side.  The flavors were so muted and bland that I sequestered all of the condiments (hot sauce, cajun spice, brown mustard) and put them to use, which significantly improved the sandwich.  As for the fries, they were of the previously frozen shoestring variety (I saw the box)--similar to McD's fries, but not as crisp--and were utterly forgettable sans condiments.Interestingly, this place seems to be a haven for single male grad students during the dinner hour.  In the 30 min. or so I was there, I was the only female who ate in--all of the other diners were solo men in their mid-twenties with textbooks in front of them. In contrast, there were plenty of women, couples, groups, etc. dining at Noodles and Co. a block away. Maybe cheesesteaks for dinner are a dude thing?At the time of my visit, I found the dining area acceptably clean, and the service friendly and fairly efficient.  This is likely due to the time of my visit (5:30pm), however, since Uncle Sam's is probably much more popular at lunch time.  Thus, YMMV.Given that I'm from DE, where Capriotti's originated, I have exacting sandwich standards, and I have yet to find a place in PGH that satisfies them.  While Uncle Sam's is a cut above Subway, it isn't quite as good as Peppi's, which I also found underwhelming, despite its good reputation.  Thus, my search for a satiating sandwich continues...
Beef 'N Bottle=Great Scott! I traveled back in time and didn't need a Delorean OR 1.21 jiggawatts of electricity! All I needed to do was eat at the Beef and Bottle.  Old school? Based on the wood paneling and framed, yellowed photos of such greats as Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra and, who is that? Bert Convy?, the Beef and Bottle was settled and collecting dust when Old School was in kindergarten. Sure, it's not exactly SWANK (the piano bar seems more converted trailer/walled in patio than anything), but I'm not exactly a swank cat. I tend to travel the other side of the tracks. (And by "other side," I mean the underneath.) To wit, I thought the strange rear entrance, the presence of barbed wire and, yes, the wood paneling, actually were POSITIVES rather than negatives.The food? Tasty. Not too expensive. Actually the steaks were priced around those of Longhorn and Outback rather than a Ruth Chris. However, the sear and crust on my ribeye were superior to those chain joints, so point goes to B&B. The meat was cooked to spec, medium rare. Sure, the most nouvelle the menu gets is the presence of shrimp, but hey, sometimes the occasion calls for a salad of iceberg lettuce and gloppy ranch dressing. That last sentence sounds insulting, but I assure you aspiring Foodie Douches, it is not. I meant it with great sincerity.In fact, the only thing I found to gripe about was the intensely low lighting made the menu difficult to read though, I'm sure, it makes your date much more attractive. I'll give Beef and Bottle a solid 4 stars. I think I'll be coming back when I return to town.Truly looks like a strip club from the street. Would never have walked in to the place were it not for Yelp. The experience is a bit schizoid. You enter through the rear parking lot into an atrium and then pass through down a step in to a dark dining area. Our greeter looked approximately 16 and didn't quite fit in the overall club-y vibe they seem to be going for.Similarly schiz-y were the customers who were dressed in date nite dinner-out clothes as well as shorts and t-shirts. I am not sure who the target market is as there were small kids around, which seemed out-of-place, as well as middle-aged couples who were clearly regulars.Food is steakhouse circa 1972. Dishes are straight up what-you-see-is-what-you-get. What they do, they do well but there are absolutely no surprises.  Steak or shrimp, salad, potatoes and some kind of side veggie.Didn't try the desserts as we were stuffed from the meal.Overall service was pleasant and well-modulated.  Not sure if this is a place to take a date as it is solid, but not stellar.Loved this place, I love supporting the local restaurants as apposed to the larger steak chains in the area (cough cough: Sullivan's, Flemings, etc...) This place looks like an old Pennsylvania lodge from the 80's playing rat pack music - kind of cool. Service was excellent!! (oh - and 1/2 price bottles of wine on Thursdays!) Here is what was ordered: cheese spread at table - awesome oysters Rockefeller - perfect salad - average steak fillet medium rare - PERFECT and tasty!! lobster - above average and delightful scallops - local from Virginia and perfect baked potato - loaded and yummy! chocolate dessert - average key lime pie - really great! I would go back for sure!Ok, I must admit I have driven by this place a million times and had decided I was never going there based on the fact there were no windows and it sorta looked like a strip joint from the outside....My husband who has is iphone glued to his hand at all time loves looking up reviews of things before we go someplace and suggested we try this.  I was skeptical.  We pulled in and went in the back which is the main entrance.  It's dark, not very fancy, and there's Sinatra music blaring. We were seated and given a basket of crackers to spread with delicious cheese spread.  Then we were given a lettuce salad and a tray of veggies to sort of "make your own" salad.  I ordered steak tips with mushrooms and peppers and had rice pilaf as my side.  My husband had the sirloin with a sweet potato.  Both were amazingly good!  The steak was cooked perfect and had been basted in garlic butter (no calories!)  For our whole dinner it was only like $17 per person including the salad, oh and they have this amazing garlic toast!  You must have some if you go.I was definitely not psyched about going but the experience and the food will have me coming back again!I still think this is the best place to get a steak in Charlotte. Bold statement... right?If you haven't been here, there's a good chance you have passed right by it and not even realized what it is. My mom actually asked if it was strip club. It's not fancy. When you walk inside, you feel like you stepped into an episode of the Sopranos. Very old school feel.What to order: Appetizers: you really can't go wrong with any them. Keep in mind though... you have a lot of food coming.Meal: The specials are all really good. However, you absolutely can not go wrong with the filet and shrimp scampi combo. The filet cuts like butter. The shrimp.. perfection. Bonus: dinner comes with a side and salad. At most steakhouses, both are extra. The salad spread comes to your table. You get to make your own. All the dressings are homemade. Feeling naughty? Get the blue cheese. Every calorie is so worth it.Dessert: I don't care how full you are. Get apple pie with cinnamon ice cream.Deal alert: Mondays and Thursdays you can get half off glasses and bottles of wine.Service is top notch. If you want to do a Friday or Saturday, you may want to call ahead to make a reservation. They get pretty busy.I debated on the 5th star, but you know what?  The Manager asked me if there I was anything he should change and I told him "Please don't change a thing, you can only mess it up".  Concerning the commentary about how it looks from the outside:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Yeah, it has some "Mafia hideout place to bring your mistress maybe it's really a strip club" look to it - but if you haven't figured it out by now, that IS part of the charm and the appeal.  One reviewer here thinks none of the clientele are locals.  Perhaps he is clairvoyant, but I don't think it is possible to make such a claim.Pricey?  Not really.  Making comparisons to Outback?  You should probably stick with Outback.To start - our waitress (also the bartender) Hillary made me one of the better Old Fashioneds with Dark Rum I've had.  She left out the orange but it was still pretty great.  Now she knows she has Myers on hand, too. We had "the cheese" but with Panini bread instead of crackers.  Sounds silly, I know.  I thought the cheese was to die for, and the danger here is eating too much of it.  Next time I will eat the cheese with a spoon when no one is looking.  The bread is crazy good, too.  There is a reason they bring this out to your table when you are seated - it's tastes really good.We also had French Onion Soup, Salad with Blue Cheese, Shrimp Scampi (prepared perfectly), Trout (perfect), Ribeye (it was hard to resist licking my plate in public when it was gone), Creamed Spinach (awesome) and Mushrooms.  (I love mushrooms, but these are prepared in a wine sauce, wheras I am more of a garlic butter fan).We had a hard time choosing a bottle of wine, but we described what we were looking for and another waiter made a recommendation - it was spot on.  I think it may be crowded on Mon and Thurs for half-priced wine nights, so remember you probably need a reservation any night of the week.  When we were leaving a van full of seniors showed up with no reservations.  The Manager was trying to accommodate, and I hope they were able to work it out but...trust me, make a reservation.We had to skip the dessert this time, but it was tempting.We thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, and sincerely hope it doesn't change a bit.  We are new fans and cannot wait to go back.  To anyone who didn't like it, you should probably stick with chain restaurants.
Woodlands=So I have to admit that I am an Indian food snob. I went to school in NYC and ate on 6th street (aka Curry Row) 2 to 3 times a week, because it was cheap and tasty. Once I got a job and had a little cash to spend, I scoured Queens for the best buffets and samosa stands. I'm a little nuts about Indian.That being said, this is one of the reasons I'm culinarily comfy in Charlotte. Better than 90% of the Indian I've eaten, it's reasonably priced, traditionally spiced, has a fascinatingly diverse menu (Dosa's are amazing, and so are the curries! Their Szchecuan dishes taste like high-end chinese! CRAZY), and a sweet, if tho often harried, waitstaff. Very importantly: they trust you when you ask for "very spicy". If you tell them fry-me spicy, it comes out fry-me, crying, happy spicy. I can't tell you how often this is NOT the case, although my fellow Indian food snobs will understand how frustrating this can be.Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands-down.Woodlands always comes through for vegetarian Indian.  Even for the biggest lover of meat , vegetarian Indian is the best.  It is so good and spicy you don't even miss your favorite meat products.  If you haven't tried Indian food, I like to order a lot and eat family style.  So if it is a first visit bring a couple of people with you, so you can order more food. The menu is daunting at first glance, if you aren't familiar with Indian food, some of my favorites are the okra and tomatoes, chickpeas in tomato sauce, cheese in tomato sauce, eggplant - there are always plenty of lentil dishes.  Once when you get the Indian words down, you find your favorites fast.  Don't forget to order bread.  It is the most important part for dipping!  If you like it spicy- remember to tell them, because it is so much better spicy.  I might suggest ordering everything medium and one dish spicy, so then you can see what your comfort level is.  Woodlands is not much to look at - this restaurant is begging for a makeover, it could be so cute, but it is so broke down.  In fact, I prefer  take away rather than dining in.  If you judge restaurants by their restrooms, don't even go in.  Woodlands has awesome food.I tried out Woodlands on the recommendation of a friend (who happens to be a vegetarian) with a group of girls on President's day as we all had it off of work. I'll be honest - I've not had great experience with Indian food, but this restaurant completely changed my mind. It was literally the best pure vegetarian food I've ever eaten. We decided to get the full experience and share a bunch of dishes around the table. Here's a list of what we ordered: Appetizers Samosa Chaat - chopped samosa topped with wheat crispies, yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney - this was literally the best item I had at lunch. It was the perfect blend of texture and flavor and set the bar high for the rest of our meal. Dahi Batata Puri - cripy dough topped with yogurt, potatoes and chutney - very delicious but also quite rich. Lunch Pesarat Masala Dosa - green lentil crepe - this came out looking like a huge pancake, and it was almost as delicious. The dipping sauces were quite good and gave the crepe a bit more flavor. Chana Batura - large puffy bread (think elephant ear with no cinnamon/sugar) with chana masala (chickpeas in delicious sauce) - great item for someone who has never tried (or says they don't like) Indian food. It had great seasoning but wasn't too spicy. The bread was great with everything we had on the table. Palak Paneer - spinach and home made cottage cheese with tomatoes, onions and spices - my second favorite thing we ordered - I paired it with the puffy bread just to change things up a bit. That puffy bread is good with everything. Gobi Manchurian with gravy - marinated cauliflower sauteed with ginger, garlic, green onions and soy sauce - the sauce was absolutely divine. Gobi Paratha - whole wheat bread stuffed with cauliflower, potatoes and spices - this was my least favorite item we ordered as it was very spicy (even though the menu says "mildy spiced"). It was still good...but something had to be my least favorite, and this was it. Parking was not a problem and it's not too far from uptown. The food has no trans-fat and there is an organic menu available. Tables don't turn over very quickly, so the restaurant seemed full the entire time we were there. I highly recommend this restaurant and will be going back soon to try out some new dishes.Ok ok....So, these guys aren't the easiest to find, get to, track down, locate, etc, but the journey far exceeded my expectations. On the outskirts of Eastland, it's not the prettiest area, but I dig the trudgery it took to experience the flavorful onslaught. It's purely vegetarian/vegan. Not a whisper of meat was found in our food. Started with the pea/potato samosas and garlic naan. Perfectly executed. The sauces served alongside were lovely. Spicy and pungeant. I'd order these again, but would look forward to trying another variety. The garlic naan was legendary. Chewy, charred in places, and kicked so much flavorful ass.For entrees, we went with Chana Masala and the Paper Dosa. Masala was absolutely wonderful -- served with jasmine rice. The Paper Dosa.....just look at my photos or anyone else's. It's like a joke. So massive and hilariously served on a medium sized plate. It's a crepe-like bread with a potato mash on the base of the plate and a few dipping sauces. It's one of the most versatile Indian dishes I've experienced. the sheer size of the dish will stick with you for the rest of your life. However, the flavors are wonderful and earthy. I'd order it again in a heartbeat. Service was efficient, but they did seem to exude the "you're inconveniencing me right now" sort of attitude a few times. Not a huge deal, but it did make use the eatpayleave strategy.Would I go back? Hell yes. Will I get Paper Dosa again? Hell yes. Am I stoked to explore the menu further? Oh....hell yes. Count me in as a part of the Woodlands fanclub.My review was written four years ago, so I thought it was time for an update.  Still solid four stars, bathrooms have been remodeled, many owner changes and currently service is a little slow, but if you know this going in and you are in a good mood you can certainly tolerate it.  We meet at 5p on the dot, order starters and a bottle of wine immediately, but if you don't know this, you might be sitting there a little while.  If you like spicy food be sure to specify because they will tone it down for you.  Especially if you are getting take away tell them HOT or they will write medium down.  Even with crazy service, I don't care, Woodlands remains one of my favorite restaurants in the Queen City.
Anzios Italian Restaurant=Remember that scene in Lady and the Tramp with the spaghetti...don't lie. you remember. Anzios always reminds me of that scene. Small, quaint, the little checkered table cloths. Its adorable.They have great pizza. there is something special about the crust and thick cheese that they use and the mild yet tasty sauce. The salads are always perfectly chilled, perfect lettuce. The hotwings are making my mouth water thinking about them.The service has always been terrific. I have been going for years and have not had one single bad experience. They are prompt and friendly but not clingy to the table. and Its been awhile but 30 cent wing night was always something a little special.I like the comparison to Lady & the Tramp that Nathan S. made in his review. This place totally reminds me of that scene too with the red & white checkered table cloths.The service at Anzio's is usually very good.The salads are very good.The bread is good.The pizza and the other dishes are just ok.The beer selection is lacking, no good micro-brews (get some Sierra Nevada, New Belgium beers or at least some Four Peaks, would ya?)And that's all I've got to say about thatWent to lunch on a Sunday with some girlfriends, and they picked Anzios, found out that the place has been in business for 28 years, I love small local places!  And it looks like fellow Phoenicians love it too!   I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and added chicken to it, the creamy alfredo sauce has some great flavor, couldn't get enough of it, even used the garlic bread to mopped it up, oh soo yummy! The noodles cooked perfectly and the chicken tender and tasty! The garlic bread was perfectly toasted & soaked up sauce beautifully!  The side salad was crisp & fresh, a perfect little salad.Our server Gus made sure that we were taking care of, very friendly and helpful!  I love local places & great service!  I will be back!
Cajun Yard Dog, Arboretum=Finally made it in to Cajun Yard Dog! This place can be a bit tricky with getting a table! Quaint inside, popular for sports fans and great food can pack out the inside in no time flat. My wife and I ventured in for an early-ish dinner on a Saturday night. The menu houses a phantasmagorical array of Cajun choices. Etouffe, jambalaya, seafood....all choices apropos for the bayou-seeking culinaries. First, we ordered a few drinks and an app. Great beer choices. Red Oak from outside of Greeensboro, and Abita root beer. If you haven't had Abita's root beer, you must. It's incredibly flavorful and not overtly laden with sassafras. The house-made chips are wondrously prepared. A little more done than most, served with herb sour cream and a BBQ cream. The BBQ cream is faint and sweet and the herb is much more pungent.My wife ordered a menagerie of side items. Veggies, Mac n' cheese, fried okra and jalapeno cheese grits...oh, those grits. They are incredibly creamy and packed with flavor(s). All were fantastic. I had the chicken jambalaya. A HEAPING plate of jambalaya packed with chicken, smoked summer sausage, rice, spices and a brilliant sauce. Each bite is packed with that roux-y, tomatoe-y, spicy sauce and the chicken/sausage chunks in each bite are subtle and plentiful. The level of spice is manageable for anyone, in my opinion. Not over the top but definitely enough for you to recognize throughout the meal. There was so much of it, I had to take most of it home!  Prices are fair and the service was great. Next time, have to try the desserts!So happy with this quaint, festooned with Mardi Gras accoutrement, Cajun joint! Can't wait to go back!
Diamond China 2=I was looking for a new Chinese place to check out near home and after passing on one because they did not have the dish I was in the mood for, I settled on Diamond China 2.  It was my first visit and I am impressed.  The place does not stand out physically by any means.  Not from the outside anyhow.  When you first walk in it does not seem any better.  The front counter looks like any Chinese take-out place.  Nothing special about it.  But I was quickly greeted and seated in a very friendly manner.  Service with a smile is a truism here.  The dining area is very clean and not in the least bit gimicky like some other Chinese places around town.  This is classy without being gaudy.  The blue floral print on the benches and seats if soothing and comfortable.  It also brightens up the room a bit.I began looking immediately to the noodle section of the menu.  I wanted chow fun noodles, my new favorite.  Before I found the dry style beef chow fun and decided on that, I was brought a pot of hot tea, a glass of ice water and a bowl of crispy fried noodles with sweet and sour.  It was like they read my mind.  Soon, the waitress came back to take my order.  She asked me if I ever had the dish before and told me a bit about it.  "Fun with bean sprouts and beef" and "True Hong Kong style" were how the dish was described to me.  I was also assured this was her favorite dish.  Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.  I sure liked it though.  The noodles were not as dried out and chewy as at some other places I have ordered chow fun from.  They were still tender but with that trademark chew of a rice noodle without being like rubber.  The beef was tender and delicious.  Maybe a bit sparse but honestly, with the bean sprouts and green onions mixed in with the noodles, the amount of beef was hardly disappointing.  I still came away full and floating away after a pot of tea and three glasses of water on top of my meal.  I'll be checking this place out again.  The food is good.  The service is excellent.  And the pricing is about average.I came across Diamond China 2 by accident. There were a couple of hours to use wisely ahead of my doctor's appointment at Advanced Foot &  Ankle Specialists near Mountain View Hospital. After the twenty mile drive from Henderson I was up for a Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. I was driving around the area when I decided to pull into the Lake Mead at Buffalo Smith's-anchored shopping center to see if there is a Chinese Restaurant. I was in luck when I  saw Diamond China 2.   Before stepping inside, I checked out their luncheon special menu hanging on the window. The luncheon special that is served Monday through Saturday from 11:00 am to 3 pm looked worthwhile. This menu separates the luncheon special into three price points ranging from $5.50 to $6.95. Corresponding to this review are pictures of the luncheon special and restaurant menus. The luncheon specials include a choice of white or fried rice, skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce, hot tea, and eggflower soup for dining in. The $5.95 price point includes two cheese puffs, and the $6.95 price point includes one piece of egg roll. In similar style to many of the Chinese restaurants, the highest price point includes the shrimp-based entrees.    Diamond China 2  is a rectangular shaped restaurant. The rectangle is divided into two rooms. Customers walk into the left room where the take out counter, cash register, and view of the kitchen are. Customers that are dining in proceed into the room on the right.   The dining experience was more casual than the take-out atmosphere in a Chinese Restaurant that would include New York Chinese or China Go Go. This is a full service restaurant. And good service at that. The waitress, hostess, and cashier, who's name I believe is Grace was exceedingly polite.    At the time of further reviewing my choices, there was a pot of hot tea with a cup and a bowl of skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce rested on the clean table. I have reviewed several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and never have I seen the waitress offer complimentary hot tea. The hot tea is delicious here. Too bad I have been unsuccessful finding the quality of hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve in a Starbuck's. But that is another review all together. I selected the chow mein soft noodles. They served it on a plate divided by fried rice to the left and the chow mein soft noodles to the right. It was delicious and in my opinion far better than the chow mein noodles served in China Go Go that are more filler than tasty. And those onions that were interspersed with the chow mein noodles added to the deliciousness of the entree. Between the crunchy noodles and the entree, I enjoyed a bowl (not a cup) of eggflower soup.    The best part of this lunch was that before a well-deserved tip, all this came to $5.95. That's a few dollars less than a fast food restaurant. The Diamond China 2 luncheon special was $5.95 well spent.
43rd Express=Are you the type of person who likes to explore new places? A true adventurer by definition?Have I got a hot one for you; 43rd Express, aka; 'Pho 43rd'.Owned by the same Vietnamese family for over twenty years, Pho 43rd, despite its dive-like ambiance both inside and out, is truly a charm.The pho is above average and served with all the accoutrements; bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, and jalapenos. Try the beef, tripe and tendon pho, asking them to conspicuously leave out the tendon and tripe. (I never said I was an adventurer, I only asked if you were) It's delicious.Their sauces are a delight, featuring a traditional siracha, their own chili paste, and a delicious homemade hoisin sauce. Spring rolls were light and wonderfully tasty. A strong recommend.The service is fast and very friendly.Upon leaving, the owner introduced himself and gave us a brief history of the restaurant:-How he and his brother worked in the kitchen since they were small children.-How the family has owned the restaurant for over twenty years, surviving the great recession. -How mom is now retired, passing on the family business to her sons. His story was impressive. One that makes anyone not familiar with the restaurant industry know just how difficult it is to succeed in this type of business, with all the hard work and sacrifice.Pho 43rd ceased to be a dive at that point, embodying the true spirit of capitalism and the American dream. I left, feeling both satiated, and proud of David (owner) and his family for what they've accomplished.If you're disinclined to visit a place like this based on its location and outward appearance, you'll be missing out. IMPORTANT NOTE: THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH.I hardly want to tell anyone, because I want to keep the place all to myself.WOW.Be adventurous. Try the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, or the salty plum soda.The soup bowls are gigantic. The egg rolls come with a platter of greens and dipping sauce. The prices are inexpensive and the service is great.At 2pm all the tables were full. That tells you something.UPDATE:Went the very next day with entire family. We each tried a different rice noodle soup. Everyone liked what they got, but we will note that meat is more of a garnish, so if you want more meat, you should order an extra order of it ont he side, which a lot of people do. But just know that at $6-9 (depending on what kind of soup you order), you are getting a lot of food that will fill you up, if you like a lot of fresh vegetables, noodles and broth. The broth is heavenly.On our way out we were followed out the front door to be given a rare treat: a macaroon ice cream sandwich, gratis. Now they probably don't make a habit of doing this, but we thought it was very generous, and it tasted out of this world!This is probably going to be a go-to lunch spot form now on!What took me so long to try 43rd Express?!  The staff was very attentive and explained to us that we didn't have to stick to the combos, but mix and match items if we wanted to.  I had heard about the macaron ice cream sandwiches so I was very eager to try one.  I ordered the red velvet macaron with chocolate chip ice cream in the middle.   It was so good!!  I recommend eating it right away before the ice cream starts to melt.  The texture is chewy and true to the flavors you choose.  A lot macarons these days are just sweet, but this place does it right!  The owner must have seen how excited I was because he gave my husband and I each regular macaron on the house!  I thoroughly enjoyed their customer service.  Since this was our first visit to 43rd Express, we were shown how to eat the dishes by pouring a special sauce over the meal.  My dish came with a fried egg, which was cooked the way I wish all eggs would be cooked.  You can see what I mean by some of the pictures posted on Yelp.  The fried eggs are crispy underneath and around the edges, and is just so perfect.  The entree I ordered came with a bowl of broth on the side.  The flavor rich and comforting.  43rd Express is now my go-to Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Five stars!!Pho is perfect for many things:as a meal, hangovers, cool weather and evoking feelings of nostalgia (IMO)43rd Express has it down pat. Throw your preconceived judgements and feelings of the exterior and interior appearance out the window. After dining here twice already, it's the kindness of their service and flavor of food that keeps me coming back for more- you already know that a good portion are their macarons as well!With the weather a bit cooler I decided to go with the Beef Ball and Rare Steak Pho and a Sam Bo Luong (sweet palm sugar drink with barley, seaweed, dried fruits and dessert beans). Unfortunately they were out of many drinks that day, so I finally settle with a Thai tea.Yes, yes, yes. Their pho broth is still consistent and lovely as always, aromatic, savory, salty and slightly sweet. Love how they provide a generous helping of basil and bean sprouts. Their rare steak is always tender and the beef balls- I must admit ... my biggest pet peeve is when Pho restaurants have beef balls with the little bits of fat studded throughout. These did not have that at all, yay! Always a large serving portion here that is inexpensive even for a college student like me.The girl helping us was so nice, to discount the meal since so many items were unavailable which was unnecessary but a great thought. She was also so kind and apologetic, but it was all so understandable.Free drink off the menu with a check- in on yelp.If there is a pho place you should try, it's this one!Definitely the best pho I've had in Arizona. Broth is flavorful and everything is very authentic. Pho tai ($6.50) is a good classic dish to order. My sister ordered the pho dac biet ($6.75) which includes steak and tripe (intestinal lining). We agreed that the pho here was really bomb and that we'd gladly return. The restaurant is kind of a hole-in-the-wall in a semi-sketchy area, but the food is well worth it.I also ordered 6 macarons because I was tempted by all the yelp pictures. They are $1.50 and larger than macarons sold at other places. They were delicious and very pretty to look at. I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and prices are very reasonable.TIP: Free drink with yelp check-in!I might have a macaron habit. But please, don't tell my addiction counselor.OMG so much amazing happens in the 43rd express kitchen. The saying "you don't know what you're missing" comes to mind when I think of everyone who's not had one of their a macaron ice cream sandwich.Never had the pleasure of experiencing Phoenix best macaron?, then get here, now. Unless that is, you've been here before, and if you've been here before and not had their macarons, I don't feel bad for you, I feel sorry. Sorry that you didn't order the best macaron you'll experience in Phoenix. With flavors like strawberry ice cream, taro ice cream, and Oreo cookie, the ice cream alone is delish, but they combine their home made ice cream with amazing macarons to form Ultron, defender of the universe. But seriously, it's a friggen macaron ice cream sandwich. It's rare that I head west for anything gastronomically delightful but this is just one of those places. If death must find me west of central phoenix, let it find me at 43rd express with a fistful of macarons and a mouth full of ice cream sandwich!! :-)Happy yelping!

Dragon Court=First, a disclaimer: I grew up chasing the best dim sum in Atlanta with my comfort-food-starved-family, and I've tasted the dim sum delights of countless cities including Hong Kong. I understand that Charlotte, NC probably won't host the dim sum mecca we ABCs of the Carolinas are looking for.That being said, I'd have to say that Dragon Court hits the spot when traveling to Asia isn't on your agenda.Finding Dragon Court can be a little unsettling. As you're walking through the desolate shopping center courtyard, you'll see rows of abandoned shopping carts, an empty water garden, a stack or two of broken wooden pallets, and a coin operated merry-go-round. We almost didn't make it.Upon entering Dragon Court, however, you'll find that it's ambiance is pretty similar to many dim sum restaurants. One thing that's a little weird is that as soon as you sit down, pretty much every available food cart will flock to you. I guess since I've never been on a particularly busy day, the servers seek out customers specifically rather than just circling the restaurant waiting for you to flag them down.I've been to the other Dim Sum restaurant, and dish versus dish, I felt like Dragon Court wins out. My favorite dim sum staples are all pretty much there, too. My trusty dining partner said he'd be a little intimidated to go it alone without me, but that's the beauty of dim sum: there's so little commitment. Because it's just a series of tiny dishes, if you hate it, move on.Ultimately, Dragon Court satisfies my need for the occasional dim sum to break the monotony of Sunday brunches of eggs benedict and sweet and savory crepes (ooo actually those sound tasty at the moment...).11/13/10Don't ever come here!!  Should've known better than to stay and try the food,  after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server (the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal); It took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water.  Service was very slow (the noodles arrived first, and that was half an hour or more after we arrived); our server was surly, almost to the point of rudeness; and my nephew and I even checked out the aquarium there-- it was almost void of live fish (maybe one swimming), w/ dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water.  NASTY!  But (and there's always a "but" in these kinds of reviews, isn't there?) we were starving... Next time, I will insist on going somewhere else, especially when there are many signs telling us to!  (Funnily enough, the restroom here wasn't that bad...  I'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here, so the restrooms aren't used much?  LOL)Total bill was just under $50, w/ minimal tip.  Food included about six dim sum plates, a beef stir-fry, lo mein noodles, tea, and water.  The only item all of us liked here (Mom, sister, my nephew, and me) were the noodles!  The beef stir-fry was the only thing I thought was palatable, w/ some of the meat tougher than the others.  (Don't even get me started on the dim sum fillings!) I'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone!  I wouldn't be surprised to hear this place closing down very soon, if it isn't already. What a horrible experience.  :(
Wing King Cafe=After hearing all of the Wing King hoopla and praise, it was destiny to stumble upon this fantastic joint at some point. We had played a round of disc golf down at Winthrop and were on our way back up I-77 and then *CLICK*. We were close to Wing King. The timing was perfect, the hunger was imminent, and wings were on the menu. On our way, we read a few other reviews and were a little iffy about dining in or taking out. We decided the full experience was necessary. We seated ourselves and grabbed our own menu and began to peruse the mountain of sauces available. Everything from teriyaki to crazy dry rubs. We settled on a large basket of fries with a side of medium sauce for my wife and 10 wings (5 Medium and 5 Honey Hot) for me. The fries are great. Krinkle cut with a subtle dusting of seasoning salt. The medium sauce....Textbook. It really does stick the the doctrine of "medium" and doesn't provide too much spiciness. Pungent flavor and well rounded with a buttery finish. The wings are evenly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and a good mix of flats and drums. I'm a big fan of the mixture as I feel flats tend to have more flavor and are more tender. The sauces work wonders on chicken. Goodness gracious. The medium will make any dyed in the wool wing-lover weak at the knees. The honey hot is something out of a romance novel. A sweet, succulent sauce that is thick like honey and has a slight twinge of heat. We even started dipping our fries in it! Usually 10 wings is too much for me, but I muscled through these bad boys with ease. I would have to say that Wing King lives up to the infamy. Wings that can turn my head and stay in my flavor memory are rare. I look forward to many visits to come!Our usual Tuesday get together usually involves wings and beer. Lately, it's been the Wing King in Fort Mill. This time, we decided to get past the fact that this WK is actually in a gas station plaza and give it a try.I opted for 15 honey hot BBQ boneless wings. A little drippy in the sauce department, but the chicken bits were cooked right, the sauce tasted great and they were piping hot.Good choice. Beer specials, or at least reasonably priced beer. Lots of stuff that's been fried. What's not to love?
Italian American Club Restaurant=If anyone had told me that I, a Jewish girl from Brooklyn and former hippie, would be living in Vegas and watchin a '30s-'40's swing show in the Italian-American Social Club, I'd think they'd just arrived on the first flight from Mars.  There's just no end to the Secrets of Sin City!How'd we get there?  An offering from LV House Seats.  It was definitely not my speed, but the description was intriguing.  And, they serve dinner (optional), so we figured we could kill two birds with one bocce ball.Aside from the fact that the average age of the audience was the wrong side of 75 (the saxophone player is 96 - and I am, to plagiarize Dave Barry, NOT making this up), the show was delightful. The reason for the offer was because the second part of the show was being taped for TV and will be seen on some local cable station - which one escapes me - in a few weeks.Jeanne Brei was the singer and star of the show, which runs the first Thursday of every month.   She's a pro - a woman of a certain age with a great voice and more energy than a 10-year-old.  The band is incredibly talented and date back to the very beginning of Vegas history - the sax player played with Benny Goodman, and all the other "youngsters" probably have a combined 200 years of experience.  She and the band are known as the Speakeasy Swingers.  Though listening to music such as "Pennies from Heaven" is definitely not my cup of Chianti, the show was very enjoyable.  There's also a large dance floor, populated mostly with a few professional dancers, but some regular couples got up to dance, too, though not the 95-year-old woman in the wheelchair who used to do solo flying.  The second part of the show, the one that'll be shown on TV, featured Jeanne, a talented tap dance duo, and solos by a couple of very good singers.But this is Yelp, so now to the food.  It was mostly terrific.  And no surprise - Italian!  I ordered Chicken Marsala.  I couldn't see the chicken, because it was buried under more mushrooms than I've ever seen on this dish - dark, woodsy, mushrooms in an authentic and rich Marsala sauce.  The same sauce, with even more mushrooms, covered the perfectly-cooked linguine served alongside it.  Hubby had Chicken Piccata, and it, too, was different - it was garnished with beautiful THINGS:  were they uncured olives? capers on steroids?  They're not my thing, so I couldn't tell, but my husband sure loved them.  Both entrees came with a small, unremarkable dinner salad in an unfortunate styrofoam bowl, and the bread, which should have been as wonderful as the food, was awful.  I think there's no cover for the show, and the fact that it was offered on LV House Seats was merely to ensure an audience for the taped portion.  Sometime during the evening a gentleman walked around with a basket collecting contributions "for the band."The large room is, no surprise, very dated - probably dates back to the Bugsy era, and there's a full bar in a completely separate room, with a juke box.This is surely worth a trip - for the entertainment, the food, and the nostalgia of a bygone era.  And you can even go for free Salsa lessons on the other Thursdays!!This is an old school restaurant and it's very good.  I came here for a show and had dinner in their restaurant section before moving to the room where they have entertainment and dancing.I was seated promptly and given a menu.  Someone quickly came for drink order and I soon had my iced tea.  After asking my server, Andrea, some questions about portion sizes, I went with a Caesar salad to start and veal marsala for my main course.  I was brought bread that was accompanied by three butters--one regular, one pesto flavored, and one olive flavored. My salad was quite large and it was very good.  Light on the dressing but heavy with the cheese and the cheese is done a different way.  The parmesan slices are baked in a bowl and broken and put in pieces under and throughout the salad.  This baking gives the cheese extra flavor and I really enjoyed the salad.The veal was very good.  The marsala sauce was rich and flavorful.  With the dish came a choice of side--either pasta or potato--and I took the daily pasta of ziti with marinara.  This was a good dish of pasta.I asked Andrea for her recommendation on dessert.  She to;d me her favorite was cannoli, but I have been disappointed by some restaurants in the past with cannoli so I went with her second choice--their house made tiramisu.  It was very good  with mascarpone, lady fingers, espresso and Belgian cocoa.  The espresso was not overpowering and the same for the cocoa.  It was a perfectly balanced, creamy, tasty ending to the meal.Service was excellent!  All the servers and bussers constantly circulated through the two rooms.  No table was just one person's.  Rather, they all looked out for each other and served the customers well.  This is somewhat why I call it old school.  The service and food are two reasons why the place has been around for over 50 years.
Humberto's Mexican Food=Based on my first meal there I can only give 3 starts for now. My 3 star is rating the food, not the complex or the interior. I will explain. The complex has been there for 300 years, it was updated once about 150 years ago. There is a Pep Boys, Country Boys, Ghetto Boys (just kidding) there is a MEGA liquidator, a RC Hobby Store, a lawn mower place, a guitar place, car audio and maybe 3 other places. The complex is in dire need of cleaning, paint and general upkeep. Humbertos is a dive, the interior is sparse and ugly, The decorations are strange and old. The paint is gross, the floor is decent but the entire seating area needs rehab-ed. The KITCHEN is Immaculate, I am talking clean. The cook knows that that is his domain and likes it clean like his 67 Impala. The food was priced reasonably, I had carne asada quesidilla, Ryan had pork and chicken tacos. The food was good. Right on par with other bertos, nothing stood out as bad or as excellent. The service was friendly and the food arrived quickly. If I were in the area getting my car worked on or picking through the junk at the Mega store, I would go back. I doubt I would go out of my way to come here.
Skyland Family Restaurant=There is a difference between "cheap" and "inexpensive." Skyland is the "inexpensive" part with low cost meals that are good quality and good quantity. I love that they are open 24 hours and in this part of town, that's a good thing. Short walk - quarter mile - from the Woodlawn Lynx station as well.My daughter and I both opted for breakfast and were quickly served large portions and as much coffee as we could drink. My cheese and mushroom omelet had plenty of both. The hash browns were plentiful though you might want yours a little more well done.Two full meals for $20 with tip. Hard to go wrong there!
Eribertos Mexican Food=I'm a huge fan of most ***bertos type joints. I occasionally enjoy having lard drip down my chin after biting into a questionable beef taco...       NOT HERE. The oil very obviously hadn't been replaced in who knows how long. It was pure sickness. I am not a picky eater by any stretch. Growing up with little $ has it's perks in that way. Something has to have zero redeeming qualities for me to not just eat it anyway.I usually love fish tacos at places like this but these were fucking awful, not crispy, sauce tasted like straight mayo tacos from Hades.      blech!I won't return. I'm taking a long break from any ***bertos as well after this experience. My heart and cholesterol levels thank you Eribertos.I gotta say I like Eri's brother Fili much better. Or is it a sister. I'm not sure. While I devoured the carnitas tacos in my car at Filibertos, happily, with a smile and even a sense of danger...the goods I've had at Eribertos have left my mouth dry, unfulfilled and on one occasion, injured. Yes. I said injured. Keep reading. Rickie likes the Americana Burrito for breakfast...had it twice...both times too dry for me. No beans? I've eaten the carne asada and carnitas tacos...both just OK...I like my carnitas to be both succulent and crispy. Did I just say succulent? So I'm not always fulfilled...as I am with a carnitas tacos from Fiiberto's. AND then there was the time when I bit into some strange foreign object...and by foreign object I do not mean Aziz Ansari. Though biting into him might be mighty tasty. The drive thru guys are uber friendly. I wonder sometimes though, does anyone ever go inside? Fili. Eri. Whatev. Just glad when I need a fix I don't have to get outta my car! Buenos Nachos My Yelpitas!
Baba's Tsi-bugan Restaurant=We used to send a co-worker here to pick up lunch. We had them (especially Marissa) on speed dial. And I know they dread when I'm the one calling because I'm not Filipino enough for them. LOL. We call and ask what's on the menu since it changes every so often but we always get crispy pata. Their version is different from what you'll normally see in Filipino restaurants - appearance-wise. Theirs is super puffy. Crispy pata is one of my favorite Filipino dishes. Fried, crispy porky goodness...mmmm...  The dipping sauce is great (soy sauce + vinegar+ jalapeno + onions)...I just gave away the recipe! Great! I'm banned from this place now.CASH ONLY turo-turo (translation: turo = point). You point at the food you want and that's what they'll give you which is great if you're not super familiar with Filipino dishes. If you point with your lips, they'll love that! There are items such as crispy pata that's made to order.Other things that are good here are: halo-halo, turon and pork BBQ. They're pretty generous with the stuff they put in their halo-halo (leche flan, ube,  beans, etc). The turon (bananas and jackfruit wrapped in wonton-like wrapper, fried and drizzled with caramelized sugar) is sweet and crispy. Filipino BBQ is totally different from what Americans know as BBQ.  The Filipino BBQ is on a stick and is marinated in soy sauce, calamansi/lemon, sugar and sometimes ketchup. Yum!The first time I actually came here to eat, I was a bit shocked as to how small the place was but whatever. Pack it!Disclaimer Alert...This review is strictly for their service, Shanghai Lumpia, and Halo-Halo.  That being said, I found Baba's to be 4 stars in my book.  First of all, service here is great.  I didn't get the owners names, but they treated us like family. One of the owners reminded me of my mom and couldn't help do what us sons of a Filipino moms do, that's joke with them a little.  She was game and did the same. As for their food, we didn't get to try much because they were out of almost everything.  Baba's on our visit was catering 3 parties at the time.  With only one person cooking in the back, this meant they were out of Chicken BBQ, Turon, and Chicken Adobo to name a few. But they still had their Halo-Halo and Shanghai Lumpia, which are my favorite Flip dishes.  As a Halo-Halo Hunter, I found that Baba's had pretty much everything I look for in Halo-Halo (i.e. Ube ice cream, legit ube, flan, white beans, and nata de coco).  One thing that was missing was red bean.  It was still good and found Baba's Halo-Halo up there with the challengers around town. Note to self...bring some red bean to make it perfect.  As for their Shanghai Lumpia, I thought that they were as good as it gets.  No one makes them better than my Auntie Heidi, but Baba's is pretty damn close.  I'm not saying I'm a Lumpia Hunter, but I am a Lumpia Whisperer.  Whispers..if they make them, I will come.  Come to eat Shanghai Lumpia that is. Overall, I can see myself coming back.  This place is no secret.  Tons of regulars coming in and phoning in is proof that Baba's is some people's go-to Pinoy spot.  You don't have to be a Halo-Halo Hunter or even a Lumpia Whisperer to eat here. You just have to be a fan of Filipino food served by great business owners.TIP:  Call ahead or pick up their menu.  Some items are served on specific days.  Shanghia Lumpia is all the time!!YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (466/500)I ordered some catering dished for a pool party I had recently. Everyone loves some Filipino food, so I was excited to try out this joint. We ordered:SisigLumpiaPancit BihonChicken on stickEverything was super good. The only thing people didn't like as much was the pancit. I make it pretty often and they said that it didn't taste as fresh or as "fishy sauce" as they like it. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Especially because I didn't have to cook it! We didn't even have leftovers for about 15 people. We spent roughly $180 for the 4 dishes. Which is really not too bad. Overall, we'll definitely be going back to this place. I want to try out some more stuff to compare it to my family's cooking. :) Also, I need more sinigang in my life.
Genie G's=That's right, I'm giving this little greasy spoon 5 stars.  The food is everything you would require from a diner - tasty, hot, cheap.  I love the atmosphere!  Think Pulp Fiction - this place makes me feel like Vincent and Jules are in the booth behind me.  It adds a fun little element when you come in hungover/still drunk for breakfast.  The service is like you'd imagine it would be - a woman passes by every 3 minutes and calls you hun while she fills your coffee cup.We stopped in for breakfast before hitting the road back to Vegas.  Located off of Indian School Road, its easy to find with plenty of parking.The building itself is older and the decor on the inside reflected its age.  Upon entering we were greeted immediately.  We were able to choose any place to sit.  Our waitress was amazing.  She was so friendly with us during our visit.  I think she knew just about every customer that walked through the door.  Needless to say there were many regulars visiting for breakfast.  I ordered the Spinach & Feta egg white omelet.  Our waitress informed me there was also mushrooms, onions and tomatoes inside.  Sounds good to me!  I chose the hash browns for my side with sourdough toast.  The cook that morning was quite efficient.  Our breakfast was out in a flash.  The omelet was so tasty with the yummy ingredients.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly.  There was a lot of food sitting in front of me for $7.99.   My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy.  A huge portion for only $3.99.  Everything had low prices for an abundant amount of food. I would have no problems stopping back in for breakfast.
Crazy Jim's=I've been going to Crazy Jim's for at least 12 years and it is one of my favorite spots for anything Feta. I have probably had every item on the menu throughout this 12 year relationship and have never had anything I did not like. Here are my top 5: 1. Gyro Feta Pita (loaded with gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and feta)2. Spring Mix Chicken Feta Salad (Enough to feed two people)3. Calamari Feta Salad (Crunchy and tasty) 4. Penelope Pizza (Chicken and Artichoke)5. Fresh Warm Pita Bread (a must have)The restaurant is cozy, casual, clean, and the staff is very friendly and prompt.  I have tried other Greek restaurants in Phx that have either been way to gimmicky or a total bust and none compare to Crazy Jim's. If anything ever happened to this place I would go "CRAZY"!!!!!!I finally made it back to Crazy Jim's... and just as I remembered, it was crazy delicious!I was taken to Crazy Jim's for the first time when I moved here several years ago... and I remember it being somewhere on the avenues downtown - obviously, I didn't know my way around the Valley yet.  Now I'll never forget where CJ's is located; it's easy - on 15th Ave just south of Indian School!Upon entering, it's easy to tell that CJ's has been around for a long time - it's comfortable, casual, and packed during lunchtime; filled with regulars I would assume.  (I'd be a regular if I lived or worked closer to the location.)I can only write about their salads and pita bread, but that's enough for me... the pita is pitalicious - I could eat the whole basket if I weren't so carb conscious.  It's sweet and savory and served warm and oh... so good!  The feta they use in the salads tastes like it's straight from the dairy farm; it melts in your mouth.  I have to explore the other menu options one day, and I have a feeling they won't disappoint.I definitely will not wait so long to return to Crazy Jim's!Gabi's review got me jonesing for CJs so I headed back over for lunch. Maybe it's a middle age thing, but I always forgot how good they are in between visits.Since I live close by, this is pretty much how CJs and I roll: 1) hit up website, 2) read entire menu 4 to 14 times, 3) pare down top 10 selections to 1 or 2 and call in order, 4) hop in car, and 5) return home 15 minutes later for a private pig out on the coffee table (so I have room to spread out). They do offer delivery, but it takes longer to get my feast on and I don't always need / want $15 of food.Since it's all pretty much been said, let me just tell you the few things that make CJs a stand out:* I have never found one thing on their menu that I wouldn't order again. * There is nothing that CJs feta doesn't make better... bring it!* I could eat my weight in their pitas and never tire of them.* The creamy greek dressing is 'lick your plate clean' to die for.* You will not find a better deal on baklava anywhere in the city (seriously it would be hard to get the ingredients for the price they charge).If you are eating in, grab a cold beer or some wine to wash down your meal (and they are working on upgrading their liquor license, so they will have mixed drinks soon).Don't let the location or the homey diner atmosphere fool you. This place serves up incredible food made from insanely fresh ingredients with flavors to match!Best pita bread IN THE VALLEY! I crave the pita bread enough to make me order a salad (a basket of it comes as a side with a salad) and their Ranch dressing is tasty (Hidden Valley packet tasty). My go-tos are: the goat cheese (with spring greens) or the gyro feta salad. Salads are around $10 but pretty filling.Non-pita lovers can get burgers or pizza :)I can't say I'm in the western avenues a lot, but in the future, whenever I make my way due west, I'll know where to get my Mediterranean fix! Crazy Jim's is hidden on 15th Avenue just south of Indian School. It's unassuming and you could easily drive right past it and never know the difference. But, take my advice and find time to stop in. You won't regret it. While in between meetings today, Gabi M introduced me to Crazy Jim's and I'm sure glad she did! We were seated by the friendly hostess in the narrow restaurant. Our drinks were brought out within minutes. We started with a side of hummus and pita bread and I opted for the Greek salad with chicken. I was told the dressing on the salad is excellent. The hummus came out in a bowl and the pita bread was fresh and warm. The hummus didn't have a ton of kick to it, but it still had the creamy hummus taste so it satisfied my chickpea craving. So here is where I shed some light on the concept of a salad from Crazy Jim's. Holy moly salad size! I think they gave me an entire chicken breast on the top of a salad of greens, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese and onions. The salad dressing came on the side and was creamy, delicious and definitely not low-cal (but I don't care)! The meal was hearty but not overly filling. I liked how the salad was hefty enough that I definitely didn't leave hungry for more. So in summary, there's nothing crazy about Jim's except the fact that they are crazy about their food and getting it right! The next time I find myself on 15th Avenue, I'll know where to go.
Kabob Grill=I've had take out here about 3 times now and it has always been good! I always call in before  I go so I don't have to wait and it's ready in about 10 minutes... The service is friendly especially the gentleman who I assume is either the manager or owner. You order the counter and there is both indoor and patio seating available. The prices are fair as well as the portions.. The dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) are addicting and have a delicious lemon taste to them! HOT TIP: If you like vinaigrette for your salad then request the lemon and oil dressing upon ordering.. If not, they usually give you a creamy sauce.. Also, they can toss the salad for you in the dressing and some special Mediterranean seasoning if you request it!I can never go back and I am bummed about it! MAJOR-LY.Here's the sad, sad tale: My husband and I had been frequenting Kabob Grille. Their lentil soup is homemade perfection, their vegetarian combo a delight, and their pistachio baklava is just amazing.So about a week ago, we were having dinner and a fight broke out between a Middle Eastern husband and wife. More accurately, a husband lost his temper and started yelling at his wife in front of their two young girls. When I say yelling, I mean unbelievably aggressive IN YOUR FACE, I'm-going-to-beat-you-up yelling. This continued for a few minutes inside the restaurant. Then, they took it outside. More yelling - hitting cars - more yelling - pushing. Meanwhile, the two little girls are sitting at the bar, teary-eyed. More yelling. What does the manager/owner do about this? NOTHING. He seemed to know the couple. He just stands outside watching as this man reviles his wife. Now, I don't know what caused the fight in the first place but there is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Can you imagine what happens behind closed doors?What should have been done:1) The owner/manager tells the couple that this is unacceptable in his establishment2) Ensure the two girls are OK3) Call the police when the husband starts hitting parked cars4) Apologize to customers and staff5) Offer a complimentary drink or dessert -  at leastNone of the above happened.
Northside Nathan's Pizza=I've eaten here many times and had the Pizza, which I rate 4 Stars.  However, this most recent visit I decided to try the Thunderbird Sandwich $8.35 (Baked Chicken Breast, Ham, Pepperoni, Cheese) w/Lettuce, Tomato, Fries on the side for an extra $1.00.After a short wait, they brought out the food.  The Sandwich was piping hot....and looked so good!  I had to let it cool off for a minute because I didn't want to burn the hell out of my tongue.  It cooled off and I took a bite....WOW!  The combination of Baked Chicken, Ham, and Pepperoni was amazing!  The sharp flavor of the Pepporoni complimented the slightly salted Ham and perfectly baked Chicken Breast.  The Cheese and the Bread put it over the top!The Fries were pre-fab crinkle Fries and were nothing special....I'll pass on them next time.Overall, I was impressed by their Sandwich.  I already love their Pizza.  I would give them 4.5 Stars if I could.Will I return?  There are a bunch of other Sandwiches I want to try....hell yeah!Since Tenaya Creek Brewery doesn't serve food, we ordered delivery from Northside Nathan's, which is nearby.  After browsing the menu, we decided to get a Large 1/2 Guys & Dolls (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onions) & Veggetarian (Onions, Peppers, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives).....$24.  They told us 45 min to 1 hour.....not bad during the Super Bowl.The food didn't seem to take long to deliver.....we anxiously tore open the box and started to dive into it....it was very very good!  The crust is thick like Sicilian style Pizza and is fluffy and full of flavor.  The Pizza is square-cut and holds the toppings well on the crust.  It hit the spot!Easily one of my favorite Pizza & Sandwich joints in town.Return Factor - 100%
Rincon Criollo=Have been back a couple times since last review.  I am tempted to up my rating to 5 stars.  Food is that good.  Maybe I'm going crazy but it seems like they might have raised their prices a little bit.  I feel like everything used to be $6 or $7 and now it's $8 or $9.Whatever, it's still totally worth it.  Same awesome waitress with awesome grill.  Prices may have gone up but food hasn't changed at all.4.5 starsI definitely would say try this place, but as for 5 stars, guess I'm a bit of a conservative Cubana. I am Cuban, and learned how to cook at the ripe age of 9, I will be 44 this July and it still is a passion. The passion of Cuban cooking comes from so many different aspects, first, the culture, the value of family, tradition, smells, flavors, colors, presentation and appreciation. One thing I have learned from cooking is if your heart is not in it, the flavor and the love in your food will be nonexistent! So....when I try Cuban food that is not mine or my families, I am a bit of a snob. But, this charming little hole in the wall, I felt the passion upon entering the place. The lady "Tati" who answered the phone and aided me with driving directions, was very welcoming, hospitable and anxious for us to sit and grub. I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacates (avocados, onions, vinegar and salt), tostones (crispy fried plantains), and the Boliche (Cuban-style pot roast stuffed with Spanish Chorizo), of course I have to order a Malta (malt beverage-ice cold). The appetizers were right on, perfect, the Boliche however, lacked the Spanish chorizo, the meat was tender tasty and presented well as were the accompanying black beans and white rice. But, honestly, my beans are better as is my black beans. I have often urged my sister to help me start a catering business or better yet, help me open a Cuban cafe, but in San Francisco, CA., I am not sure it would take off, people in California are much more partial to Mexican food. We did return the next day for lunch, my friend ordered the same thing she had the night before "Camarones Enchilados", which is sauteed prawns in tomato sauce, garlic, cumin, wine, onions and peppers served over white rice and black beans. She LOVED it so much and I was thinking the entire time, she would flip if she had mine! I ordered the steak sandwich and I was shocked when the sandwich arrived with lettuce and tomatoes??????????!!!!! Cuban sandwiches are forbidden to have lettuce and tomatoes...LOL! Anyways I removed it and had my sandwich, the meat was a little fatty, which is a No NO for Cuban sandwiches.....again we ordered tostones and avocado salad, this time the tostones must have been made by someone else they just weren't the same. But, it felt good to be around my own environment, my culture, my food and the staff here is excellent! They want to please and they want you to eat it all, which is very Cuban by the way, I give them a 4 stars, and I would go back, especially if I ever come to Vegas again, since I cannot cook while I am away from home, this is a life saver for someone craving some good Qooban food.Located on Las Vegas Blvd near Charleston. In the grungy area so usually do it in the day and it's not good for big parties as the dining room is really small.This is a follow up review and I Love this place. But I'm not over selling it and dont expect a fancy looking decor and designer napkins - it's not gonna happen. The waitress and t.v. are set for spanish...cuban style so be ready.Lunch pollo criollo , black beans, avacado salad and iron beer.  All we're bangin my drums and made it a better day :)Fast service  and like eating at a relatives and all really good.Been eating here for along time.
Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe=I know this phrase is overused on Yelp, but this place is a hidden gem!  If you're looking for a cute little place on the North Side to grab some casual, delicious diner-style breakfast or lunch eats, look no further!  CM and I stopped by yesterday at 12:30pm for lunch on the way to the Mattress Factory, since we didn't have cash, ruling out my first choice (Wilson's BBQ).  Despite being my second choice, this sweet little sandwich shoppe (love the old-timey spelling, BTW!) exceeded our expectations.Based on the recommendation of our waitress, I ordered the blueberry pancake special ($5.09), and a side order of home fries ($1.50).  My order came with three good-sized pancakes packed with delicious, juicy whole blueberries, topped with a ribbon of whipped cream.  The last time I received pancakes with this many blueberries was at Dutch Eating Place in RTM in Philly!  The pancakes themselves were of a nice consistency--not too thick or thin, or too light or heavy--just right.  My only wish was that there was more whipped cream--but then again, my waistline is thanking me for not flagging down the waitress to ask for more.  The home fries were cooked just right, with a hint of crispness on the outside, and were further enhanced by some additional salt/pepper seasoning and hot sauce.  CM ordered the chicken breast sandwich, Cajun style ($6.95), which was topped with lettuce and tomatoes, and came with a side of chips and a mayonnaise-y dipping sauce.  Because he was still feeling under the weather, I didn't sample it, but he was very pleased with it--although he did tell me it wasn't very spicy. (But then again, this is Bland-burgh...)Despite our arrival half an hour before closing, our waitress was convivial, assuring us that we could take our time eating and not rushing us out the door.  Based on their interactions with the employees, many of the other customers appeared to be regulars, which speaks well of this place's loyalty among the locals.  I only wish they were open past 1pm on Saturdays, since it would be nice to be able to feast on breakfast food and sandwiches later into the afternoon.  Our check came to $13.54--extremely reasonable, in light of the quality of the food received. Personally, I think this place is much better than Peppi's. 4.5 stars.
Timpone's=The food wasn't memorable, but the service was.Our waitress had no idea what she was talking about and seemed abrasive and rude!  Unfriendliness aside, she didn't even do her job very well.It's expensive, and just based on service alone, I wouldn't go back.
KJ Kitchen=I just had one of those meals that I'll remember forever here.  Now I have to confess, it might have been much different had we gone alone -- but we went with some serious foodie Chinese friends who are regulars and wow -- we were seriously blown away.  Here's how my Chinese host puts it:  You know a Chinese place is good when it meets 3 criteria:  1)  The line outside the door is all Chinese.   2) The bathroom is dirty   3)  There are flies. We had a ten course tasting menu -- family style.  Started with a pot of pork and winter melon soup -- simple, light -- and as our host said -- free, so don't complain.  Who would?  Next came the "free chicken" -- all tables of 7 or more get the whole chicken -- that's Chinese poached chicken, served cold, hacked, bone in -- with a remarkable cold ginger sauce that I'm still thinking about.Then our server came out with our fish and lobster for our host to inspect -- and the reason he invited us to join him.  He wanted to teach my husband the difference in "fresh fish" and "live fish" -- there really aren't that many places in town -- or anywhere actually, that serve their fish from flipping, to flat in a matter of minutes.   And this was one of those mind-blowingly red rockfish -- that if you swam up to in the ocean, you'd definitely avoid.  The lobster was at least 5 pounds and gorgeous and pissed.   Soon, they would be our dinner -- and honestly I felt guilty and unworthy.Next, they brought out a platter of the most phenomenal looking prawns -- I'm talking 6 inches long, brilliant pink, heads and tails on -- for us to peel and eat, and dip into ponzu.   These were so fresh, I'm blown away -- packed with roe.  Truly a life changing dish for me.Then jellyfish -- with daikon and cucumber -- great acidity, sweetness, crunch -- and the slippery-ness of the jellyfish -- texture, flavor -- and we loved it.  Had thirds.Then there was tofu, that creamy, slippery kind that defy my Anglo chopstick skills.  Imagine, my horror and shame, when they presented me with a fork.   Yep, that bad.Then string beans -- the twice fried kind.  Shivers...they were so good.Oh, we did a quick check of the door -- we arrived at 7 -- and the line was  about 15 deep and super cranky that the two of us slipped past them (all clearly regulars) to our host and his wife and other guests who were already seated... we were the only white folk in the place -- and I don't think it went over well...   Now it wasn't even 8:30 and the line was still as long, and the room packed... I'm talking big parties, too. Back to the food...after that brief respite, they brought sauteed oysters and green onions,  stir fried rice with dried scallops and egg, the magnificent lobster, stirfried.  Then the rockfish -- Hong Kong style -- over more tofu, with more scallions and more ponzu -- nature's true art -- and a tribute to the chef that he served it so simply -- whole in all its beauty.Then, tada...crispy frog with jalapeno, fried garlic and green onions.   Yep -- frog -- apparently not such a rarity on menus in Vegas, as one would think.  Our host explained that frog is a big deal in China -- a very common ingredient -- rice paddies... I had never thought about that before.  His other guest also lauded frog's excellent medicinal benefits...since my husband is Alsatian, and frog is popular there, I guess I'm going to have to rethink things... it was definitely good enough to have again -- just for the batter it was in -- and yes, it tasted like chicken...The chef came out as dessert was served to visit with our host and meet my husband.  He is fascinating, the dessert, not so much...it was a red bean tapioca soupy sort of thing -- ok, it was the only miss for me -- but again, no complaints since it was complimentary... Seriously, for those of you looking for a truly authentic Chinese meal -- I implore you to try this restaurant -- now mind you, this was a simple Tuesday night -- and it was slammed.   This is a completely hidden, local Chinese only secret, which probably explains the reason there is only one mediocre review... and btw, the fish aren't in a tank by the door... But I truly believe that it would be best to begin asking your Chinese friends to come with you -- my guess is they're sworn to secrecy.  And I'll send you this wish, that your meal is as wonderful as ours was.Oh, and this place is open late -- I think 2am.  Try to come with friends in one car, too -- the parking lot is small, and in classic Spring Mt style, shared with a host of other businesses, but all are taken up by KJ Kitchen customers.  So there may be a wait for a parking spot, too.Here is the thing: I live in Austin Texas. You know what the best Chinese restaurant in Austin Texas is called? PF MFing Chang. Yeah... exactly. Therefore, when I leave Austin Texas I'm on a mission for Chinese food. Not beef and broccoli but REAL Chinese food. Therefore, when my buddy asked where I wanted to go my only answer was an authentic Chinese restaurant and KJ Kitchen was PERFECT. We ordered 4 items because...well.. I didn't know the next time I would be able to eat authentic Chinese food and quite frankly, I CAN put away enough food for 2 1/2 people. I'm not skeered. We ordered fried sea bass which was served with a dipping sauce that was not the slightest bit greasy and incredibly tasty. We also ordered sauteed Chinese broccoli which was as good as one would expect. I don't think you can really have spectacular Chinese broccoli. Whatever. Also we had a noodle dish and the steamed chicken both of which were VERY good. The service was very prompt and courteous and I never felt rushed. The owner also came over to say hello which was a nice touch. The atmosphere was as to be expected in an authentic Chinese restaurant: lobster tank, the usual art, nothing spectacular.. overall nice.Alright fellow gamblers, I think i've finally found one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. This hidden gem is about a mile or 2 west of Chinatown in a small shopping center. We started with the Egg Flower soup with crab meat. Yumalicious! I'm not a big vegetable guy, but I loved their garlic spinach. If you like tofu, order the clay pot cooked tofu. It's a great mix with your rice.  Now you gotta get the honey walnut shrimp because it was perfectly glazed and not overly mayo'd out. The walnuts tasted fresh and were well glazed too. For our meat dish, we got the sweet and sour pork which wasn't that great. I would probably order a beef or chicken dish next time. Finally, these last two items are what you MUST get here. The pan fried crab and the pan fried lobster. I loved the seasoning used in both dishes. You'll be sucking the poor critters shells dry. Don't forget about the egg in the crab shell!  Now for the warning. This place gets packed. The servers and waiters get your food out quick, but your wait will still be from 30 minutes to 1hr. The overall service was good, but they do get extremely busy so you'll have to waive them down a few times.  I suggest getting there a little early. They do open till 2am and they start serving hot pot after 10pm.  So after the casinos give you a nice butt pounding, head for KJ Kitchen for some healing.I have dined at KJ many times and have enjoyed their great food and reasonable prices. However, my last (and final) trip there was quite an unpleasant experience. We arrived at 7 PM and were seated pretty quickly within 10 minutes. Our server came by promptly and took our order of about 10 dishes, including appetizer soup and entrees. And then we waited.....I checked with the server on our order at 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, and 50 minutes. We were getting the "it's coming" and "they know" run-around answer. He even dared to say "it's the new computer system we have, you just have to wait." At over one hour since we ordered, I finally asked for the supervisor. She actually went to the kitchen (unlike the server) and had our rushed. At 8:15 PM, we finally received our appetizer. We were never given an explanation or even a simple apology. Unfortunately, the good food and cheap prices does not compensate for the horrible staff at this restaurant. I will never go to this restaurant again.This place is 100% a 5-Star place, however, only if you pass this quiz:Chinese food I eat most is:a. Chow Meinb. Fried Ricec. Lemon Chickend. Broccoli Beefe. All above but with brown ricef. Steamed Rock Cod with scallion, oil and soy sauce.If you picked "F", then read on below.  If you picked a-e, then this place will be a THREE-STAR for you and you are better off going to PF Chang, Pei Wei or Panda.For any of you picking "F", you will know this place is pretty darn good and well worth a 5 star.a.  The place - This place is a just the right size. Perhaps 10 -11 tables and also a separated area with two very large banquet tables. I can see this place would be busy at dinners and for lunch it was just right.b.  The service - I know I was in a real cantonese place because of the service. I would have to classify it as indifferent efficiency.  However, that being said, I wanted to order something not on the menu and worked with them and they had it and they asked me if it was the way I liked it. Also it was not too busy.c.  The FOOD -- You know you are in the right place when at the front door is a large fish tank with dozens of rock cod in the tank and also another tank with huge geoduck in it.  Yeah baby.  Let's get ready to rock it.- Rock Cod steamed - This s essentially a key fish in cantonese cuisine, at least in my book.  The rock cod themselves have rather large bones and is perfect to steam. The meat is just the right texture and when you add the scallion, oil and soy sauce, the smell, the taste, the natural sauce, it is absolutely the best.- Bitter Melon with spare ribs in black bean sauce - Now listen here all, you know you are in a great place if they serve bitter melon. How many people would normally order bitter melon.  If this was served at Panda, it would never be sold. but here, my goodness, it was great. The melon was just right, firm, not crunchy. The black bean sauce was just the right amount ant the ribs were cut to about an inch or so and was perfect!  When I first moved to LV, I could not find this at any Chinese restaurant so I learned how to make it and at KJ, I love it!- Steamed Chicken with Scallion and Ginger - Now I did not see this on their menu, and they had similar items that were fried, but I needed mine the authentic steamed method. I asked the waitress if they had this after I attempted to describe it and she knew exactly what I wanted and they brought it out.  The half chicken order was perfect. Tons of shredded scallion on top of the chicken that had a very thin layer of skin which means, awesome tasting proper chicken baby!  Yep, the best chicken for this is the not so thick and meaty chicken, but the bony rather emaciated chicken that have a wonderful taste. This dish was just perfect and I had to have extra ginger sauce as it was so good. d.  Overall - You know you are in a really authentic Cantonese restaurant when you see the following:- The Shovel Method - Yep, that is right.  You shovel the rice from a bowl into your mouth with chopsticks. You do NOT try to pick the rice up, you are NOT dainty, you are NOT polite.  You SHOVEL the morsels of rice into your mouth.  By the way, no soy sauce on the rice.  When you are eating Cantonese style, you are putting the food in your plate or your rice bowl and the fragrant and tasty juices of the dishes are absorbed by your rice. Much tastier than soy sauce.- The Boney Plates.  Yeah, not "china" plates but BONEY plates. Yep, true Cantonese people love their meats on the bone.  The bonier the better.  You will hear some sucking and some crunching, gnawing and jawing, however, the best visual is a plate piled with bones stripped clean like a piranha attacked it!- Oh yeah, no silverware.  Come on.  How can anyone eat Cantonese with a fork and knife is beyond me.  BTW, isn't it funny to see so many people at other restaurants eating Chinese food on an american style plate trying to use a chopstick?   I use silverware when eating in Chinese restaurants that do not have bowls.  Shovel method.  That is the way to go!GK says, check this place out. If you see someone making a ton of noise and gushing all over the bones on his plate.  Check him out. That could be ME!EXCEPTIONAL SOUTHERN STYLE CHINESE CUISINEThere are plenty of cheap eats in Las Vegas that serves great Chinese comfort  food. However for exceptional culinary excellence at most reasonable prices, there is KJ Kitchen which stands near or at the top. It's been years since my last visit and I had no idea of how popular this restaurant had become with it's LAS Asian residents as well as repeat visitors. The LAS Asian population now exceeds 10% of the two million residents in this valley. A mix of former California residents and overseas Chinese from all over the world.. It was a festive evening with people enjoying their southern style Chinese cuisine in this packed to capacity restaurant.. On this particular evening there was a table of ten red faced joyful diners singing all sorts of songs and ballads in Mandarin.Never had crossed my mind that on a weeknight there would be a wait list for a table for four. Worse for those needing seating of six or more. We were nearly finished with our six course affair when the group of six behind us during our wait finally sat down. The couple with us was essentially new to this level of excellence and style of Chinese cuisine. Perhaps one or two Gringo sweet and sour cornstarch dishes they may have experienced at a Panda Express or entrees served at many of LAS's culturally diverse buffets. Tonight we would introduce them to an epicurean experience and delightfulness that they never would have dreamed. In fact it was so enlightening that they asked for a takeout order of one particular entree to share with their family members waiting at home to hear about this evening's Chinese dinner adventure. I'll point out which entree (photo) they took home to share. I was surprised by the choice and so will you.Yu-go chauffeur's photos of this evening's dinner will more than fill in and complete this review. Oh, one more important item to mention, service was way above average under crazy busy conditions. They more than earned their 20% gratuity.
Seamus McCaffrey's=With the two restaurants closest to the Dodge Theatre not serving alcohol (you know who you are....bastards!),  finding Seamus McCaffrey's before the Margaret Cho show was like finding an EZ Bake Oven under the tree Christmas morning. Complete joy! I really don't know downtown so when we turned the corner and saw a bunch of smokers shwilling pints on the sidewalk, we ran like school girls chasing Zac Efron. Quickly and with our tongues out. We were thirsty and ready to catch a buzz before the show. Inside it was sort of narrow with a long bar on one side and scads of tables throughout. We spied an open table on the "patio" and were told we could nab that and our server would be right out. And she was. Delightful and speedy. We ordered two Stellas and a couple shots. Didn't see any food, but perused a pretty big menu. Usual fare with approachable prices. Thank you, though, Seamus, cuz the group on the "patio" was much more entertaining than Ms. Cho!We stopped here for dinner before catching the performance of HAIR at the Herberger Theater with Amanda B. and her sister. This pub / restaurant has a quaint laid back atmosphere and quite a few brews on tap Guinness, Bass , etc; I chose a pint of Smithwick's to accompany my dinner. The menu has traditional Irish fair like Corned Beef, Sheppard's Pie, as well as burgers, salads and sandwiches. I went the safe route and had a Swiss Cheese Mushroom burger which went well with the pint I ordered. I liked the fact that the burger was 1/3 pound and had a decent flavor. Seamus' has a great downtown location, half a block off the light rail. The majority of the menu is priced under $10 and quite an array of offerings so everyone should find something they like.I stopped in for a pint of cider on Friday night with some friends. This place is much less of a pub-in-a-box than some other Irish Pubs in the area and has some character to it. It wasn't packed, but was semi-filled with an interesting mix of people trying to get out for an after-work drink downtown. The wait staff was very attentive and it was a reasonable $5.50 for a pint of Stongbow cider. Seamus loses a star for having the worst bathrooms EVER! The god-awful stench as you ascend the stairs is enough to make your eyes water and pass out from holding your breath. It smells more like a sewer problem than the bathrooms themselves, but it was enough to make me think twice before bringing out-of-town guests here again.2nd stop off the rail pup crawl.. a little walk, nice place for regulars but they did not seem to like having a large excited group there. The server was good, the drinks were good and the price was good. The restroom stunk like old piss.As I walked into Seamus McCaffrey's, I felt like I was in a serious downtown. If I hadn't known better, I could have said I was in a Chicago or San Francisco. This bar was jumping with locals, live music bounced off the walls and character filled the room. The bar is divey, it's cozy, it's dark and it's awesome. The drinks are cheap, the patrons are awesome and there's plenty of seating. Downtown Phoenix could use about 15 more types of these bars. I visited Seam McCaffrey's after a Diamondbacks game and it was so cool to see Downtown Phoenix alive and bustling on a Friday night. This bar is like a little taste of what the entire Downtown Phoenix area could be like if we took every bar and restaurant filled with character like this and placed them on the same block. Having just got back from Chicago, this bar definitely reminded me of the character the Chicago bars have and it really made my night to see it! So bottoms up Seamus McCaffrey's! You make Phoenix proud!The Food? Only if you have to.The Bathroom?  Only if you have to.  So why the five stars?  Because it does what it's supposed to extremely well.  The second I walk in I hear "hey Dante" from the bartender as he pours me a Guinness.  Can you say that about a bar in town?  I can sit with friends on the patio and people watch.  You'll likely hear Bob Barker or see Cliff.  You'll notice the alley or like to call it "narnia" for the fact that no one who walks down it ever walks out as the same person.  You can sit on the patio of Seamus and judge the people at Ghost Lounge.  You see life walking around and can do it with a cigarette in one hand and beer in the other.Great little bar down town. They get oddly crazy busy just about every night of the week. I love living down town! Their kitchen stays open late, midnight I think, they have great beers and cocktails, its a scotch drinkers dream, I couldn't even count then number of single malts they had up there behind the bar. I dragged the boyfriend in a few months ago and he is in heaven!I love the down town feel for this whole in the wall-ish bar that has been around forever it seems. Might be fun to have a few drinks then wonder over to the San Carlos hotel and get spooked. haha :-)First off didn't stay here very long may be an hour or so, but seems legit. Cute college girls and full bar a plus, but a little run down. Appetizers (wings) were not very good. Drinks were on the soft side. Like the live band, and willing to give place another chance in the future
Shenanigans Bar & Grill=This place has been here for EVERRRR It's behind the Big O Tires in the same parking lot as a bunch of car shops. This was the original "Raider" bar of N. PHX. for over 10 years I guess its under new ownership now and the new owner ousted the Raider Club. Ouch this place used to be packed!! I haven't been here in awhile, well since I had a kegerator and with these bad times I found myself here again last night for a bit while the Fiesta Bowl was on. You would think with sports on that people would be here but the parking lot was pretty empty. It was about 8-ish and the bar was quite bare with only a handful of patrons sitting at the bar possibly just for the barbie bartender behind the counter in a tight corset. It was just my brother and I but we didnt get greeted upon entering or feel welcome so much. They only had Bud, Bud Light and Amber Bock on tap and what looked like a decent selection of bottled beer. The staff wasn't overly friendly or attentive to us with my brother practically having to beg to buy another round.The atmosphere was just pretty blah all around. The projection screen looks to be the same old one and is in dyer need of being replaced. The flat screens above the bar are nice but thats about it. One more good note looks like they put in a smoking patio that seems new and some fresh paint outside to green and white. Used to be Silver & Black I guess this place really wants to set itself apart from those crazy Raider fans. I didnt make it upstairs  to have a look around (they used to have pool tables) but most of the furniture looked to be the same nothing special or new. This used to be such a great place full of energy and happy people. We left feeling neglected and spent the rest of our money on scratcher tickets at the liquor store where they like us. I don't want to believe this bar is THAT bad so I plan on returning on a busier night, to give it another go and hopefully update with more stars??Was here on a slow night; they just began hosting free poker and just like karaoke nights, the purpose is to bring in people when they aren't already coming.The slow business worked well for playing poker, as the single bartender/server was able to handle everyone nicely and with friendliness.  The place itself is super cool.  Two stories tall, done all up in wood walls with old fashioned gas pumps and junk.  It used to be called "The Service Station" at one time, but i heard that no one could find it, nestled in a strip mall full of nothing but actual auto mechanic's shops, tire stores, and car stereo installation places.I can see Shenanigan's hopping on the right nights, and with atmosphere this cool, don't know why any of the local youngster alcoholic crowd would want to congregate at nearby Native New Yorker, Applebee's, Hooter's, or Santisi Bros.Sorry, Shenanigans.You're a classic example of unrealised potential.A lady on a pole can really screw up a brutha's judgement.Such supercools digs, and yet apparent satisfaction with such a generic standard.  The sportsbar goings on in this establishment are not worthy of the amazing architecture.This new disillusionment is based on my recent attempt to actually use the bar for its main purpose, to drink alcohol.  After a sad, quick glance at the beer tap pulls, the pyramid of empties on the back of the bar make it seem like there's a large selection of bottled, at least.But no, my hoppy friends, that is not the case.  I think the most imaginative thing there was Sam Adams Boston Lager.  They had Blue Moon, but I'm not a fan.  Think of every single other generic american beer and its Lite version, and it's there.  Why?!  Why have 6 or 7 different brands of american fermented rice lager, when the current trends in pub style have everyone and their mother drinking microbrew ales, stouts, and hefes? *also* - i understand cost and spillage, etc and how important that kind of thing can be to the owner's bottom line (esp employee theft), but I have never in my life seen a bar install special caps on all the bottles of liquor and an electronic device that fits over the bottle and measures an exact pour.  I get it.  but it's stupid....and... if as the bartender, you're going to make a comment that it's not your fault the owner makes you use such a thing, at least learn how to use the damn thing !!! If i'm only getting that one ounce then you'd better be sure squirting the liquor down onto your overfill of ice cubes doesn't splash my Captain all over the side instead of into the glass!!!  .and then you'd better not splash the soda in so full to the top that it spills over the side.  That's my ounce! I paid for it, and apparently I'm not getting anymore!!if you like generic beer and don't get mixed drinks, then this place can still be pretty cool.if i win a lotto, i'm buying the damn building and tying the owner to a wall for a month so s/he can see how a bar with this much potential _should_ be run.All the food offered sucks balls (except the heaping mound of french fries for like $2 that the cook fries up quite well), and the owner guy is a TOOL, the kind of jerk that thinks it's okay to banter in a talking-shit/put-down kind of manner with a complete stranger as if they were a long time friend.  Fake friendly doesn't cut it in the service industry.This is a tough one for me. I hate to review based off a short visit. Here goes.I messaged the new owners to see if they were serving real "coke" for a mixer yet because the last time I was there it tasted horrible. She said it was RC COLAOK cool. We hear they have Karaoke and decide Saturday 4-18-15 would be a good time to check it out. We arrived around 830pm. There was 3 guys at the bar and the bar tender. We both went right into the restrooms before sitting down. THE MENS ROOM IS FILTHY AND GROSS, NEEDS A CLEANING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND A GOOD COAT OF PAINT. I walk out just in time to see a tall slender black man (I only bring up race to assist in identifying) exit the WOMENS restroom, where my wife is, I was dumbfounded, I look around to see if she was in the bar and look to be sure she was in the right restroom. She came out with the same WTF look on her face. We exchange a few seconds of dialog while walking into the seating side... look at each other, and NOW that we should just leave. We walked out 4 min after being in there... laughing at the train wreck that just happened. I doubt we would go back, not until they get cleaning and get real mixers.
Golden Nugget Chinese Buffet=Goldent Nugget has a name that mashed together the names of two of the raunchiest pornographic magazines in mass publication, so I really expected very little from them. It was a surprising visit, though, with fresh food and a super low cost. It is sad to see the other review judging this place against the other "super buffets" nearby.  It's truly an apples to orange popsicles comparison.  If you want to go to the giant place with crab legs and junk for $12.99, go ahead. If you want the kind of buffet you got in 1981, this is the place to get it, for a 1981 style price, too. Does this menu sound familiar?fried chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, pork fried rice, egg rolls, beef&broccoli, sweet&sour chicken, jello, pineapple, hot tea, get the idea?The thing is, that even early sunday afternoon, this little old school hold-out was hopping with business when the other two giant buffets nearby were full of screaming kids and gluttons piling crab legs six inches high on their plates as if they don't know they're allowed to go back for more.Golden Nugget staying so busy means a lot.  There are many regular customers coming back.  The food rotates quickly and stays fresh.  Sure, the prompt, no-frills service from the host/cashier/server/owner/? guy borders on downright surly.  However you do not bother setting foot in a place that looks like this if you need 5 star service.The food was REALLY GOOD. There was a more authentic seeming dish made with chicken and spinach in a garlic sauce that was more super than anything in the super buffets multiple steam tables of repetitive dishes. I just wish I would have gotten the number of the doctor that advertises making house calls, posted on the wall here at Golden Nugget.  Not really a good sign to see this sign....but hey, I have a few bucks I saved since I didn't go to the super buffet.The people getting take out buffet reallly got their moeny's worth, too, since the lady dishing out the food REALLY piles in as much as she can fit.[cash only]
La'Wan's=When you walk into La'Wan's there is a poster of a martini glass with a chicken leg in it. Now this makes me chuckle.  Our server was so friendly and always a step ahead of us.  He's the kind that if you have a restaurant you want to steal him away.  The food does not rock my soul, but it is served hot and plentiful.  And it's really nice  when we were leaving they all said good bye.  Very refreshing to have such a pleasant experience.  We get used to mediocre service and forget about what it's like to have proper hospitality.The menu is standard meat and two veggies, pintos, lima, collards, mac & cheese, potato salad, mashed potatoes.  Roll or cornbread.  Sweet tea. Ten dollar check average.Sometimes, you just want fried chicken. And you don't want to get it at the fast food joint. When that craving strikes you, give La'Wan's a shot.While the ordering situation was initially confusing... do I seat myself? do I order at the counter? ... it straightened out quickly. Yes, seat yourself. Yes, someone will bring a menu and take your drink order. There's also a buffet table, but I skipped that today.A few minutes later, I had a quarter of white meat chicken set down in front of me. The chicken was really excellent. Lots of meat, not a lot of batter, not too greasy at all. The mac & cheese lived up to the sign out front ("Best in the Queen City") with lots of cheesiness inside and a good topping of toasted cheese. Maybe not as good as *my* mac & cheese, but certainly some of the best that I've had away from my own kitchen. The cole slaw had the right consistency and texture, but I found the pickle relish taste to be overpowering. No worries, to each his own.Service was excellent. My water was refilled as needed, I was checked on as needed and there was a squeezy bottle of Texas Pete on the table for some bite.Really good chicken and great service. Yum!
Angie & Jimmie's Italian Pizza=I have to come to understand and accept that I am probably the reason restaurateurs  hate yelpers.I just have no appreciation for atmosphere. I know this because during my 12-day stay in the Bay area, the word had to be repeatedly hammered into my brain, as the natives could not understand how I could merely judge a restaurant's merit based solely on their cuisine. Eventually they wrote me off as a lost cause, chalking up my dis-appreciation of fine decor and tacky acoustic music as a symptom of being Phoenician. For a while I was confused. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Was I just impossible to please? Had I no taste for aesthetics? Oh shit, I have no aesthetic sensibility. I'm an art major. What does that mean for me?All I have is a clock radio. Who am I Mommy?I was beginning to have some serious doubts about my aptitude for critique. Sweet Zombie Jesus. Maybe I didn't know what I was talking about all this time.After all, Angie and Jimmie's is as far from atmosphere as you could be. Like, as far as John Cage is from actual music, or Miley Cyrus from being talented. Fun Fact: While in San Carlos we saw a guy parked underneath a Miley Cyrus billboard giving himself some of the old "self-service at the pump". True story.There are no polished tables and cushy chairs at A&J's. No, instead they have those all-plastic all-purpose chairs that last you years and years sitting in your backyard until you invite that one plus-sized friend of yours who sits in it and bends it in such a way that is is never usable again. And there is no ambient music. Only the sounds of the arcade machines and the TV, which no matter what time of day is always playing a crime drama. Or a Billy Mays infomercial. "HI BILLY MAYS HERE BUY SOME FUCKING OXI-CLEAN OR I'LL SHOVE SOME MIGHTY PUTTY UP YOUR ASS WHILE I BANG YOUR WIFE!"The staff at A&J care as much about presentation as Fred Phelps does about receiving a box set of "The L Word" for Christmas.Their wings are not soaked in the sauce (BBW calls the process "spinning") like at other joints. No, the wings are cooked, and then, the sauce is poured over them. At first you're like "this is fucking shady, I am not pleased with this", but when you can actually taste the chicken, and dont' have to ask for like fifty extra napkins, you find you might actually walk away from the table with some dignity. Try saying the same thing after paying 9 bucks for half a sandwich while ten pounds of bitch in a five pound bag asks you if you have room for dessert.The subs are meaty and quite sustaining. So I've heard. I have a rule about ordering shit that isn't on the sign. I've never ordered a cheeseburger at Del Taco or chicken nuggets at a Red Lobster, and here I am, still alive and kicking. The system works.The pizza is simply fucking fabulous. It's crispy but never crunchy, hot but never molten, and cheesy but never "hey, how long are you going to be on the toilet? I need to take a shower" cheesy. Honestly, the only pizza I've had in Phoenix that even compares to it is Pizza A Metro...which is another small independently owned pizza shop crammed next to a Circle K......Maybe it isn't me. Maybe it's just Phoenix. Or just the west side of it. Everything's backwards here. It's like Bizarro world.All the best food is located in these hole-in-the-walls, where the decor is haphazard the menus have to be laminated because people are always spilling shit on them. There's still a pretty good chance that I'm a tasteless Philistine, but we're  in Bizarro World and that makes me a learned connoisseur of wealth and taste. I fucking love it here.DING DING DING!!!! We have a winner!Yes, Phoenicians, you heard me right, I am hereby declaring a winner of the best wings in Phoenix even though I haven't been to all the restaurants that other people recommended.  There is no need. The best that another restaurant could do is come close to the yumminess available at Angie & Jimmie's, and I'm pretty sure that's not possible.  I've had plenty of adequate and good wings in P-town, but these wings are EXCELLENT!The wings are huge and meaty, covered in a mouth-watering Frank's RedHot-based sauce, and crispy.  Just the way they should be.  I haven't had wings this good since August, when I went to Duff's while I was visiting Buffalo.I have one teeny-tiny complaint though, A&J's sprinkles some seasoning on top of the hot wings that tastes like meat tenderizer.  I'll make a point of asking them not to put it on the wings next time.  It didn't make the wings bad, but it was a little distracting from everything else they did right.Other things I loved:- 5 pictures of Elvis in the dining room, 2 are on velvet- The counter is a 2x4 frame covered with lattice, the exposed lights from a beam, mismatched garden chairs, inch-thick layer of dirt on the windowsill - Just like in Buffalo!- The squeeze bottle of dressing that they give you with your wings, although I'm not sure if blue cheese is available.  I'll check next time.- The place reeks of yummy-smelling pizza. I didn't have any out of kindness to the gluten-sensitive husband, but I might have to go back and buy myself a small.- The menu is simple and perfect: pizza, wings and subs - Again, just like in Buffalo!Improvements that A&J's could make:- Kick out my neighbors and open up a second restaurant here that is only open to me.- Free food
Blue Ox Tavern=It has been over three years since I last dropped in to Blue Ox Tavern.  And up until just a few seconds ago, I was still completely uninformed about the significance of "Blue Ox", except it has some connection to Minnesota.  So if you are curious about the name, here is a brief Cliff Notes notation about this trivia:Blue Ox is actually named Babe, and is Paul Bunyan's animal companion.Blue Ox was also a professional roller hockey team based in Minneapolis, MN, that used to played in the Roller Hockey International League.But if you are expecting the interior of the tavern/sports bar to be all blue, you will be disappointed.  Hues of light pink is what you will most likely be covered with regardless of where you decided to park your hiney for the duration of your visit. But don't worry, your eyes are very good at filter that out, but it could get problematic when you try to take pictures of your food, menu or other picture worthy subject matters.  Anyway, I was here recently to catch the slightly more than half of the most boring Super Bowl event in recent memory. The place was fairly busy, but there were still a few tables and booth that were unoccupied when I walked in.  The average age of the patron was easily over 35 (and I am lowballing my guestimate), so if you are looking for young wild and crazy sports bar scene, this is probably not your best bet.  Best surprise of the afternoon was the complimentary half time buffet that was sponsored by a local law firm (the hot links and other sausages and sides were a definite hit).Their regular menu is your typical, non-gourmet bar food.  You have your appetizers (mostly fried items and nachos), salads, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast items.  I had a bowl of soup (changes daily), and one of their burgers on both visits.  Food is decent and portion is relatively large (but nothing to rave about in our local weekly magazines), and most items are under $10.  Service is decent. The waitresses checks up on you regularly, so your refills or next order of beer is practically effortless.  If you stop in to this sports bar when there are no games on, you could save $1 with your Yelp Check-in off.Overall, I like this vintage sports bar that has persevered through the years with the occasional event promotions to draw in regulars and snag a few newbies.  Good experience if you are looking for something different from your regular routine.Review #5 of 2014Most dive bars have a stench of stale smoke, barely-passable food, and sucky service. Based on my visits, Blue Ox must not be a dive bar because none of those things can be found here! Space is a bit dated but clean, and staff is downright peppy. Food is low-priced and fresh. COBB SALAD: Generous portions of all ingredients, wish the dressing were served in a cup and made in-house rather than takeout packets.* But having the calorie count handy does make me use less.ALL BEEF JALAPENO CHILI: Ask to add sour cream, onions, and cheese to make this meaty dish into a meal. Good flavor without being spicy. This would be even better if they had some sort of cornbread.FISH & CHIPS: Two smallish pieces of fresh-fried fish, crispy and flavorful. Fries are crinkle-cut but also surprisingly good. House-made tartar sauce is just right, malt vinegar available too (in a packet again).They have a few specials, like walleye on Fridays and ribs on Saturdays. Ask about their Mules Around the World drinks. Back of dining area has a separate meeting space available to reserve. Staff is always cheerful, music is a good mix of 90s alternative and radio hits.*I stand corrected, the ranch dressing here is made in-house. All other options are currently served in packets.
Shiloh Grill=CM and I had dinner at the Shiloh Grill on the 4th of July after we found that another local restaurant (that shall remain unnamed) that took our reservation was closed for the holiday.  Given that I had a City Dining Card for Shiloh, after confirming that they were open, we headed over to grab a table.  Although all of the tables on the porch were occupied, several tables inside were available, so we were able to be seated right away.Despite being seated right away, nobody came to take our drink orders until almost 10 min. later, after I made eye contact with a manager.  The waitress who took our drink orders offered the excuse that our waiter had to cover some tables both upstairs and downstairs, which is why he hadn't stopped by yet.  After 5 more minutes, he finally showed up with drinks redundant with the ones that'd already been delivered by someone else.  At that point, we were ready to order, so he took our food order.  Thankfully, the food came out reasonably quickly after that, but we weren't super pleased with the service, given the initial snafu.Because we visited on the 4th of July, there was a special limited menu, but I was pleased to see that the prices appeared to be unchanged from the norm.  First, CM and I ordered a large mac and cheese to share ($12), which was brought out prior to the entrees per our request.  Despite looking rather dry on the top, the mac and cheese didn't disappoint, and was up to the standards of the mac and cheese we'd received from the Harris Grill in Shadyside.  For my entree, I ordered the Henny Penny spicy chicken sandwich ($9.99), and CM ordered the 4th of July blue plate special ($7.76), which came with two hot dogs, tater tots, and a slice of watermelon, and also got chili sauce on the hot dogs (+ $1).  The sauce on the Henny Penny sandwich was spicier than I expected, but placing the vegetables served on the plate on it helped dampen the heat a bit.  To be honest, the sandwich wasn't my favorite, but I know it's a popular menu item here, so if you enjoy really spicy food, you may like it more than I did.  CM's hot dogs were pretty standard, but the chili was a nice touch, dressing them up a bit.  Our respective sides were mediocre, being of the previously frozen variety, and my fries were disconcertingly limp.  CM also tried to take advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free bowl of chili (worth $3.75), but after ordering it, we found out that we couldn't combine it with the City Dining Card discount (according to the fine print, this is the case--however, at least one other restaurant has let us double dip on discounts, so YMMV, I guess).While I felt that the price: food ratio was decent here (total check: $24 after discount), unlike our last experience at Harris Grill, I also felt that our meal here was pretty forgettable, aside from the lackluster service.  (Our waiter even forget the doggie bag we requested for our leftovers.)  Everything about Shiloh Grill, from the menu to the setting to the service, was almost identical to its sister restaurant, the Harris Grill, so your opinion about Harris will transfer to Shiloh pretty well, and vice versa.  As such, my rating would be a by-the-book 3.5 stars (reflecting the PGH citywide average), but the inept service we received merits a decrease to 3.0.
SteakenBurger / Long Wongs Wings=Unique, fresh and damn good. Unique, they are called Steakenburger, they combine a good burger with a good cheese steak. Nuff said Fresh, The bun...oh the buns. Fresh local bakery, sliced when ordered, light and spongy. I am a bun kinda guy. Damn good, The two slices of cheese, the two thin patties and the cheese steak fixins, all wrapped in "the bun" The beef was fresh, Thin but fresh, not frozen. Served with skin on huge steak frys.... damn good. I too wanted a second burger, but opted for 31 flavor for dessert instead.Open letter to restaurant customers everywhere (especially Yelpers):The inc.com article recently discussed in Yelp Talk makes good points about the serious impact that Yelp can have on a business, positive or negative.http://www.yelp.com/topic/tempe-new-article-on-yelphttp://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fmagazine%2F20100201%2Fyouve-been-yelped.htmlDespite any controversy the article also may have included, I realize the importance of being a responsible reviewer more after reading it, and hope I can share that feeling and understanding with you now.Especially when it comes to independent, unique, one-of-a-kind places -- would you really want your favorite local flavor to disappear because a yelper or two didn't like a particular server's muffintop or tone of voice?With that in mind, I must humbly take on a review Update that 's weighed heavily on my soul for some time.Several months after my initial review of Steakenburger, I received a note from the owner, Tom.  He sent a personal message instead of a public comment, and did NOT at all make the mistake some proprietors do by responding in an angry or condescending tone to my critiques.  Instead I found the response to be brimming with *CLASS*.I received a sincere and heartfelt letter apologizing for my experience and asking a chance for redemption.  If you read below, you can see that they took the review and steps to address its criticisms VERY SERIOUSLY.I would like to invite all Yelpers to remember to give second chances and update their reviews often, even the bad ones, whenever appropriate to do so.  Sometimes things go wrong that are outside of the biz's control.Sometimes a rogue server is having a pissy day and takes it out on you.Sometimes they just make a mistake.We all do.  And we always want another chance, don't we?  Ask us and we'll tell you we DESERVE it, too.   -----------------------------------------------------------------"Ryan C-My name is Tom Philp, owner of SteakenBurger.First, I am bummed about your bad experience.  With that said, I truly appreciate your candid feedback.  I cringe every time I re-read your experience (which is often), but I believe your review has made us a better restaurant.While we are still hiring from the human race, and will make mistakes, I'd like to believe that we listen to our critics and respond with systemic adjustments to prevent future similar occurrences.I have waited some time to respond to insure that I felt comfortable that we had improved our processes and consistency.  I'd like to invite you back for a do-over ....I've read all of your reviews and know that I could get skewered again if we fail you, but also feel that we would get a favorable review IF (and only IF) it is warranted.  At the risk of your wrath, I invite you back. Thank you for your consideration of this invitation.Tom & Judie PhilpSteakenBurger"---------------------------------------------------The folks at Steakenburger are a class act, and I wish them great luck in their tough business endeavors.Steakenburger earned their redemption, and they highly DESERVE it! I went back for the food, becasue it is unique and fresh and tasty.  The Steakenburger was a delicious meat-pile, cooked to ideal doneness, and yet still juicy without feeling greasy.  The homecut fries seem to be double fried now, or something, becasue they had a crisp outside while retaining a potatoey mushiness inside -- perfectly cut thick with the skins on.  Homecut fries are hard to crisp up, and they've done a wonderful job with this recipe.  There are ten different flavors of wings (let's see if I can remember them: mild, med, hot, suicide, zombie (?!?), bbq, honey bbq, honey hot, habanero, damn i fell short!) and there is even a neat challenge to eat a certain number of habanero wings within an hour and get your picture on the wall of fame.  I'm sure Adam Richman has this one on his radar allready for a future MvF.  Steakenburger is way more deserving than some of the junk that's been on DDD, too (Chino Bandido, blech)In summary: GO TO STEAKENBURGER !Good cheese steak + good cheeseburger=SteakenBurger What else could we hope to see? Good sushi + good pancakes=SushiCakes Good Thai food + good omelet=ThOmelet Good Schwarma + good BBQ=SchwarBQGood doughnuts + good custard=DoughTurdI can see we wouldn't want to go too far with this concept but it's working for SteakenBurger.I could have sworn I wrote a review of this place months ago. Are some of my reviews disappearing? The Yelp can't just give my reviews away because I have so many! So SteakenBurger is a pretty solid sandwich place with big portions. Consider sharing a sandwich and fries here, you can always go back for more. If they were closer to home I would go back. Ryan C's review brought me in when I was in the neighborhood. The atmosphere is pretty basic, service was friendly and the food was pretty good and reasonable.Heard about this place on one of my favorite morning talk radio shows and decided to give them a shout out. Been here a few times in the past when in the area and hungry for some grub.This is your basic Burgers, Wings, Cheesesteaks, Pizza, and deep fried vittles joint. They even offer a few items that go coco crazy spicy. One is called the Diego Dave's Habanero Wingz Challenge. If you can finish 10 wingz in under 10 minutes you will get a free T shirt and your photo on the wall.We have tried the Zombie Wingz, the HellzaPOPPIN Double Cheese Burger, a couple of the Steaken Philly Sandwiches and a few of the different deep fried Appetizers. We both thought the food was pretty good but not outstanding. Kinda like a Dairy Q on steroids and then some.Service is friendly and helpful. Give them visit and go SPICY if you dare. I could just buy their Spicy Habanero Hot Sauce and put it on some Ice Cream. Might even rub a little on my sore knee. OH YEAH!3.5 STARS
Lao Thai Kitchen=So there I was on Yelp! Looking for a Thai lunch buffet in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, none of the reviews I read had a lunch buffet. After searching through the 11 or 12 Thai Restaurant reviews in Las Vegas I stumbled on the picture of Lao Thai Kitchen [It reads "Lunch Buffet" under its name].The lunch buffet starts on Monday - Saturday from 11:00AM - 2:00PM.Pro's:1) All of the food was very fresh (even though we arrived at 1:35PM the food was still very good).2) Plenty of Available seating. Of course, this could be because we arrived at 1:35PM...3) Five or six servers means fast service.4) Several Thai dishes to choose from including soups and desert.5) Servers were very friendlyCon's1) I recommend arriving for the lunch buffet anytime before 1:30PM because, by the time we arrived, the servers were basically done serving. However, we still received drinks.2) The distance from the strip or downtown Las Vegas to Lao Thai Kitchen keeps this spot a local secret.So now your probably wondering why I gave Lao Thai Kitchen 5 stars. When I eat a buffet I am basically eating for quantity and not quality, here the quality far surpasses the quantity. Give it a try, I definitely recommend the lunch buffet at Lao Thai Kitchen.
Grandview Saloon=I joined Yelp specifically to say this: The Grandview Saloon was one of the worst culinary experiences of my life.  I would rather lick the grease off the tracks of the Duquesne Incline next door than suffer through another meal here again.The entire Grandview concept appears to be premised on the belief that as long as you've got a phenomenal view, you can charge inflated prices for food you'd be offended to find in a middle school cafeteria. In general, the food I saw was all-American in the worst possible sense - bland, slimy, and whenever possible, smothered with cheese.In our case, the chicken marsala recipe eschewed the traditional topping for some kind of watery combination of ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The shrimp scampi tasted as if it was prepared by a chef without a tongue. Our request for pita chips that were simply warm, not fried, elicited a significant delay from the kitchen, as if they couldn't figure out why any of their customers wouldn't want to slurp up something lathered in butter and oil.Frankly, we should have run out the door the moment we sat down.  My brother-in-law aptly described the decor as a Days Inn ballroom circa 1995.  The walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them.  Of course, you've got an incredible view of the downtown skyline, but that's no excuse for such hideous decorative malfeasance.  After all, Vincent van Gogh didn't frame Starry Night in particle board he pulled from a dumpster.If you've got even one iota of romantic feeling left after surveying what must surely be an accurate replica of Purgatory, the Top 40 hits from five year ago blaring over the soundtrack will surely kill the mood once and for all.  While you enjoy the strains of Pink's "Get the Party Started," you'll be left munching on beer-battered blobs, silently wondering why your life feels so empty and numb.To think that I paid almost $70 here for a two-person dinner that didn't even include alcohol makes me want to gnaw off my own pinkie with rage.  That experience would be tastier, cheaper, and far more pleasant than my time at Grandview.  However, my sacrifice will only achieve some higher meaning if I can serve as a warning to the rest of humanity.  For a great night out, check out the free view from the public observation point a few doors down, and then eat in literally any other restaurant in Pittsburgh.
Lenny's Burger Shop=Whenever I think of Lenny's Burger, I think of that urban myth about ecstasy. You know the one."If you have sex on ecstasy, you'll never be able to enjoy it sober."  Why, because the experience is that intense, or because you're brain has been so fried that you can't realize you've spent the last twenty minutes trying to fondle a rock? And why the fuck are you dropping this on me now? Like I'm not stressed out enough worrying about how a ouija board works and whether or not Mountain Dew depletes your sperm count. Shut up, you.Lenny's Burger is the ecstasy of hamburger joints.You go in there not expecting much. Perhaps even a little condescending because you're so fucking spoiled you don't know any better."Ha! Look at this ironically low-end establishment! Why, they don't even have a value menu! Bush league! Oh, how cute. They expect you to pump your own condiments. What, couldn't afford the little packets? Ha. This shall be a good laugh."And then you order, I don't know, for argument's sake, a double-patty chili burger. And fries. And let's just say that, for shits and giggles, you fill your drink cup up with horchata, because it's my fucking scenario.You bring your order back to your table. Ha. How quaint. Burgers served in a noisy steamy cafeteria setting. How retro. One minute you're biting into a slab of meat in between some bread.And the next you're in fucking Willy Wonka land.Your taste buds suddenly become Charlie and Veruca and Augustus.HOLY SHIT THIS BEEF TASTES LIKE IT CAME FROM A REAL ANIMAL! AND THIS CHILI'S FRESH! THE BUN IS TOASTED! JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST, THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING FRIES EVER! I'VE NEVER HAD BURGER JOINT FRIES THIS GOOD! AND THIS HORCHATA FUCKING ROCKS! IT TASTES JUST LIKE I IMAGINE HORCHATA WOULD TASTE!And believe me, muchachos, if there were snozberries on that burger, they would taste like snozberries.By the time you've finished your burger, you already crave one again.You spend the next few weeks trying to convince your friends to try it with you."Dude, you have to try this burger place. They have the most amazing fuck me burgers ever! Seriously.""Nah, man. I'm good."WHAT!? Bitch, you did not just turn down a suggestion from an Elite!Weeks later, you find that nobody wants to try this place.Because they're all trying to get clean.They're trying to cut back on the fast food. Get on a good diet, go vegan, cut out the refined sugars and carbs or whatever the fuck it is that people with a nutrition book do.It's not you. They're not turning YOU down.They just know. They know because they've seen it happen.One Lenny's Burger and suddenly they're lives will go out of control all over again.One bite of a double-patty country burger with cheese and chili fries and suddenly they'll start double-dipping and eating right before they go to bed, and years from now they'll be wearing those electronic belts that zap the fat off of you while they get their cry on to a very special episode of Maury Povich.It's just you and Lenny's now. You'll do your best to be stoic about it. Eating alone while tables of laughing hipsters and married couples enjoy their hearty meal, stopping to give you the occasional look as they slowly decide in their minds what could possibly be so wrong with you as to force you to eat your meals alone."Just come with me once. I'll pay for it.""No thanks. I'd rather do McDonald's.""WHAT!? Didn't you watch Super Size Me?""Actually, I just did. Now I want a Big Mac.""Fine...just this once."Go on, buddy. Try and enjoy that, what do they call it, a Large N' Delicious? A Royale With Cheese? Yeah, I'm sure you like it going in, let's see how you like it coming back out.Your stomach/intestines aren't fooled. It wants the good shit. It's not going to settle for this "McBullshit" you're trying to feed it.Just deal with it. You've been bought and paid for by Lenny's Burger Shop. You are Bitch Numero Uno.Awww, don't cry. Ronald McLittleKid'sNightmare didn't like you anyway. But Lenny's Burger, Lenny's will always love you. It will always be there for you. It will never judge you, and will even forgive this little "selling out" phase you went through. It's okay. We all make mistakes.Now...would you like cheese with that?Hopefully today you have learned something, and understand the downward spiral that is consumption of actual food.Be good, stay in school, listen to your parents, and remember, what doesn't give you high blood pressure and diabetes will only make you stronger.being from LA.. i didn't know where to get a good burger and chili cheese fries so i yelped chili cheese fries and 2 Wienerschnitzels topped the list.. and i thought.. wow.. it's gonna suck being out in AZ.. then i look further down the list and see 5 star review for lenny's burgers.and the words chili cheese fries. i didn't even read the review at all until i got back from my own experience. but jetta's review is awesome!let me say that in the midst of all the commercial chain burger joints.. we found a diamond in the rough.looks like any random burger stand but when i saw the nacho cheese dispenser.. i just prayed that the cheese they used on the chili cheese fries... i watched as they prepared my food the fries sizzling in the oil and then drenched in the real chili not that runny ground meat crap.. but has kidney beans and a bite like real chili should and then she drizzles the nacho cheese and tops it with jalapenos.. oh and the kicker.. when i grabbed a fry and chomped it down.. i realized.. they even used seasoned salt on the fries before they chili'd it. i was so pleased with the chili cheese fries i nearly missed the burger patties..they are HUGE. and i just got a single on sourdough i believe it's a 1/4 lb of meat. and real meat. i think it would have been better to have the pattie thicker rather than so thin but it was still good.they have different sauces on different burgers and a wide variety of shakes.i couldn't finish my burger which i also added bacon too and they load it up with bacon. i had about 1/3 of the pattie left and it was still bigger than a big mac pattie.. maybe even both patties put together.the establishment itself is sort of weird. it's quite narrow and there is counter space but they also have tables around the corner but it's setup in a very weird preschool like environment and it's super quiet.. almost freakishly quiet.. and i believe the restrooms are through the back door.oh and there's a HUGE sign that says they don't accept checks.. just to warn everyone but who pays for a burger with a check?It's lunch time here in the LBC, and I want a big juicy burger like the ones I used to have at Lenny's!! The only *other* thing I miss about Phx.. What a gem of a find!! Hands down, the best little burger shack I've ever been to.. ever. And we stopped there completely on accident. The smell lured us in maybe lolDon't come here looking for decor (there really is none..).. just stand in line, place your order, and wait for the good stuff to grace you with it's presence :) I remember people comparing Lenny's to In n Out and Sonic. How embarrassing! I love InO but you just can't compare the 2.. or 3. Sonic isn't even in the same league, sorry Sonic lovers of the valley. ANYWAY, if you're in the 'hood, this is a MUST. BIGGER and better than In N Out and all that other stuff for sure. Drip down your hand, cheesy, beefy mouthfuls of bliss. And the fries..mmm... geez I'm hungry now!I think your either a fan of Lenny's or not a fan.  I can't seem to understand what the "fans" are tasting when they eat at this place.  I went to this Lenny's again last week for lunch and and had there single cheese burger with a side of fries and drink.  The burger was overcooked and tasted like something you would get a burger stand on a street corner. The toppings were ok but my bun was smooshed since it was on the bottom of the bag.  The fries were plain, possibly pre-frozen.  I tried their Mexican burger on my prior visit based on some Yelp reviews and it wasn't much better than last week's burger.  Bottom line, I'm not a fan yet but it's beats going to the chain fast food places since there is not many places to go in this area.BTW ~ I find it very hard to believe the burger in the cover photo was taken at Lenny's... there's no way.
Carl's Jr.=Originally I used to like this location because it was convenient for lunch purposes.  Today I've had the worst experience out of all the restaurants I've eaten at.  A few weeks ago I was eating at this location and I took a photo of an employee texting on her phone and posted it to Yelp which you possibly can still view.  Harmless photo....Well today after I ate my lunch I was getting  ready to leave and I was approached by an employee that works here.  As he approached me he had a phone in his hand and he had my yelp profile pulled up and asked if that was me. I stated yes but I thought it was a little weird that he'd have my profile on his phone.  This employee states that his management wanted me to take a photo down that I posted a few weeks ago and that it was against the law for me to post a picture of an employee without their consent to yelp.  This same employee then stated that the mother of the employee I snapped a photo of worked there and that the employee was UNDER AGE.  I then asked him if she was under age what is she doing working there?  He really didn't have a reply for that.  I asked this employee to show me where it's against  the law to take photos and post them to yelp.  He then got a little irate.  It just amazed me that instead of serving the customers he's going through his phone and pulling up yelp reviews and confronting customers with them.  One minute he is stating that management wants me to take the photo off and then the next minute he's telling me I'm breaking the law and that Carl's Jr has lawyers and they could sue me.  At this point I was tired of listening to his nonsense and asked him to get out of my face.  Then this employee had the nerve to tell me to get out of HIS store.  All this over a photo!  At this point this employee starts yelling for his manager across the store with other customers in the store.  This same employee has horrible customer service.  Several weeks before this incident today I ordered a simple low carb burger and went to sit down.  I watched 3 other customers come in and order and receive their food before me.  So I went to ask for a refund.  At first he say he couldn't do a refund and that I would have to come back for a refund because a manager was there. I demanded a refund because I waited around 15 minutes and watched other get their food.  So then  he's telling me I have to sign a receipt saying I got a refund. I declined to sign the receipt.  I didn't sign anything when I paid for the food.  I was a little upset because my food was sitting under the warmer the whole time and he just either refused to bring it out or was just overlooked it.  Ever since then he  has had a chip on his shoulder.  One thing I do not like about situations like this is that when you say your going to make a complaint to corporate or their district manager....he responds with his first and last name like he's bullet proof or untouchable. This employee thinks it's okay to confront customers in the store and demand them to alter their reviews or photos.....then states it's managers request and then wrongly quotes the law.  I  think managers are smart enough to realize not to mention anything positive or negative involving reviews especially since it's a fast food chain.   I feel this is a case of an employee just thinking he can say or do whatever he wants involving customers.
New York Deli & Restaurant=It's rather difficult to find, hidden in the back of an otherwise boring office plaza. They clearly do not get much walk-by traffic here. It's also a little out of place in a city like Charlotte, where barbecue and Bojangles fried chicken usually rule the roost.Katz is a standard New York-style Jewish deli (though not kosher), decorated with assorted New York memorabilia including the front page of the Post celebrating the Mets/Yankees World Series and pictures of the World Trade Center. If they're trying to show their New York creds, they've succeeded.Depending on the server's mood, they'll put a bowl of cole slaw and some pickles on the table when you're seated. Katz serves the usual stuff you'd expect for such a restaurant - corned beef, pastrami, etc. What's not to be beat are the "Smokey Joe" - whitefish and nova on a bagel (get an everything bagel, of course!) and the classic Reuben sandwich. Doctor Brown's sodas available too. The chicken soup is just as good as what mom makes.If they have any left, take some rugelach to go! (They do not accept AmEx.)All the New York memorabilia this place has around the store is really easy on my eyes. (read: Yankee transplant) What is not easy on my eyes is the faux paint job that covers the walls.I think I've been more impressed by all the articles with rave reviews  they have lingering in the store front window then the sandwiches I have ordered form here.The Reuben (pastrami) was good !  but for the price ($10.50)  I would have expected great. ( the title reads "Charlotte's best Reuben"on the menu.)The portion was nice and they serve it opened face unless you ask otherwise. For the price it does not even come with fries. They do give you complimentary pickles and cole slaw. The cole slaw has no flavor at all IMO.I have sampled a few others sandwiches from the menu but this place is know for the pastrami and Reuben's? Oh and the knish,which I have also had the round potato one. If you like cheesecake order it here! It is $6.00 ($5.95) per slice but  I can easily get two slices from it and I'm a pig.Their black and whites are shipped in from NY and not bad if these are your thing .I think even the best black and white in the whole wide world might not impress me. So, if you like B/W cookies try em here for yourself.The people here have always been cool unlike the  time Peter L visited the store.Go back,Try em out Peter L , Let us know!I've been wanting to review Katz for a while, I mean I've eaten here for years and years.  I've gotten to know Lee and his fun crew.  They know about our shop, they were the first restaurant to see our new son a week fresh--back when he'd sleep in his stroller heh.So Katz, why are you wanting to go here?  I'll tell you.  They open early, for a breakfast that is hearty.  Want an omelet? Expect a full platter.  Our favorite is the 2-2-2, eggs, pancakes, bacon--inexpensive and hearty. They have some of the areas best hash browns which are more the potato chunky crunchy seasoned style.After morning you're always served some pickles and slaw.  A nice primer for a meal.  I don't know the history but I enjoy it.For lunch I have 2 go-to's.  The Philly with a side of mayo, or a half-reuben (whole if I'm ridiculously ravenous else it's waay too much.), add a basket of fries and we're good to go.  The reuben is open faced style with your choice of corned beef or pastrami styles--you can go 1/2 and 1/2 too.  Piled high with kraut, sauce and cheese. The philly on the other hand is on a crispy toasted roll loaded with brisket, mushrooms, onions and cheese.  Really tasty and hearty.My wife Robin many times will get a 1 potato 2 potato which is like  plate of meat and mash with applesauce.  She loves it, and I don't argue.Their bagel/knish platters are par for the course and I believe they now source fully from Poppy's Bagels which gets a lot of local kudos from me.Now for the finisher.. If that wasn't enough get their blintz as a dessert.. You'll get stapled to the couch for a while.  Luckily a secret is you can order a 1/2 order of them (1 blintz) and it's the perfect side.  Sided with sour cream and blueberries.The only thing I as a hearty foodie of natural product origin would like to see is-- when fruits are in season, I wish Lee would buy them.  Fresh blueberries, strawberries or peaches  with the blintz would be killer.  The other thing is we bring our own maple syrup (grade B baby!) because they have those old school corn-syrup-flavored-maple things and for the style of their breakfast it just doesn't do their product justice.  It's all probably a cost but it's points that could take it higher.They are like family and will get to know you over time so say hi for me when you're in! :DSo, since my last review in August, I have returned twice and definitely owe them a better rating. After today, I felt they deserved a four. I arrived and was seated immediately and received the complimentary pickle and cole slaw, chilled to perfection this time, I ate it all. I ordered the Turkey BLT, with Swiss on a Kaiser Roll. The sandwich was huge! And delicious! The turkey was sliced to my liking, the bacon crisp and the added touch of mayo on a fresh Kaiser Roll, OMG! I could only eat half so I took the other half to my Mom, who is from New York, and she loved it. The wait staff is great, but definitely favors the regulars, so maybe I will be one soon. I look forward to returning and definitely checking out their breakfast options & bagels sandwiches, because from what I saw they looked awesome.Finally getting around to updating one of my first dozen reviews that I wrote six years ago, it's time to repeat everything I said. Dropping the "Katz" from the name to disassociate themselves from the original Katz Deli in New York, this is now just "New York Deli". Yes, they have every right to the name as the previous owner was Katz, but this just eliminates any confusion.This is a proper New York deli with sandwiches that are more meat than bread which includes pastrami and corned beef, knishes, potato pancakes, smoked salmon and whitefish, the usual black & white cookies and of course, rugaleh pastries. There's nothing else like this in the Queen City.Depending on mood, I might have their smoked fish platter or their Reuben. The Reuben is a ton of food and has won "Best of Charlotte" a couple of times. But today, it was the "Smokey Joe" which is a toasted everything bagel, cream cheese onions, tomato and whitefish salad with a solid portion of hand-sliced Nova salmon. A great portion of very fresh food.The New York Deli isn't easy to find and it looks closed when you drive up to it. But they're open, buried in the very back of the plaza at the southeast corner of Providence and Pineville-Matthews.
Burger Mania=This is the exact same food from the exact same people who brought us the fine 7foot tall, tube sock and sneaker wearing, weiner squirting ketchup onto himself at Mr Gyros  http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-gyros-glendale#hrid:vNtdB1l_gwBMZ4slKfrGBQThey're both solid 3.5 stars, serving Chicago style dogs, falafel and gyros, italian beef, and other assorted fast food.   Mr Gyros gets 3 and so BurgerMania gets a 4, maybe for nostalgia at eating at this building in its previous incarnation as a Wendy's all through high school.I've only had the gyros and fries, both really good, with HUGE portions.I trust DarenC though, who has tried it all, and liked it all but the burgers -- but with the Pastrami-Burger getting a special mention, I had to put it on my list for next time.   (Ironic, with the name, but these guys aren't really specializing in burgers, making the alternate name "GyroMania" suggested by the previous yelper a great idea)Friendly owner or his son will chat you up if you like;  I found the matriarch of the family who served me at Mr Gyros a bit more reserved, but still cordial.  They also run the Mr Gyros II up in Anthem.So nevermind the Bell Rd car-dealerships, Motel6, Waffle House, and other nearby neighbors (the lady with the short skirt doesn't really want to 'date' you) and pop into BurgerMania for a little of everything.Disappointed I hear only good thing about Burger Mania and thought it's about time I try this place.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the food on this visit wasn't  good.The burgers at Burger Mania are exceptionally bland.  To be honest initially, when I unwrapped my burger and took the first bite I thought there wasn't a patty on the bun. When I pulled the top of the bun off I saw a very small thin patty covered in condimemts.  The burger had so many condiments it made the bun soggy and it fell apart.  The fries at Burger Mania were crispy and hot however, the fries had an odd tasting seasoning and just weren't very good.On a positive note the service at Burger Mania is fast and the prices are on the low end.  However, if you are looking for a tasty traditional  burger or would like to enjoy a burger  with a twist, I would forgo Burger Mania.
Big Wong Restaurant=Big Wong just gave me a food-gasm!Being Wong virgins, Hubby and I decided to get the Family Style Dinner so we could try a wide variety of menu items. The waitress/owner warned us it was a lot of food, and she did not lie. We started with a bowl of delicious egg drop soup which was quite eggy and also chock full of sliced veggies. Next came the po-po platter with flavorful and perfectly cooked tempura shrimp, beef stick (cooked to medium, very tender and tasty), pork ribs so tasty my "I don't eat things with bones" Hubby sucked it clean, yummy veggie egg rolls, and the best crab rangoons I have had in a long time. Already getting full, the entrees came next and they were so good we had to have some of each. We ordered the stir-fried scallops which came with plenty of fresh and crunchy veggies in a light garlic sauce, and the house lo-mein which was full of shrimp and pork and chicken. The noodles were perfectly cooked and flavorful. It all came with a heaping side of fried rice which seemed to have as much pork pieces, egg, shrimp, and veggies as rice. It was a ridiculous amount of food and we have more than enough left over for dinner tomorrow. It really struck me that the meat was of a higher quality than at almost any other Chinese restaurant I have been to in the Valley, and they also know how to prepare and cook seafood properly- a Phoenix rarity. Having read online that they make their own ice cream, Hubby and I simply had to try it. They have two flavors: coconut with chopped peanuts on top and a bright green one that gets some flavor from coconut, but the rest of the flavor and its color from a Chinese leaf that the owner says they use a lot in making desserts. Both were absolutely delicious. A little more icy than the super-premium double-churned ice creams most of us are used to, but I thought it was really light and refreshing.But- the owner gave us some potentially bad news. They are having some lease renewal disagreements, and may close by the end of the year, and may or may not open at another location. Go, go, go to Big Wong and experience this culinary treasure before it's too late. Hours are 11:00-2:30 M-F and 5:00-10:00 every night for dinner.
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen=Poor customer service in Spanish AND English. You just can't legislate or regulate against stupidity. It is hard to manage a franchise operation, I know. But with unemployment hovering at ten percent, I think this Popeye's can do better.The chicken I'm not interested in fueling a brand loyalty debate. It is what it is. Spitefully overpriced, but each to his own as I prefer the flavor of the spicy. But bad customer service in today's economy is UNFORGIVABLE. I'm not talking about someone who can't speak in a language I understand (because they didn't realize it ... but I speak all languages spoken at this particular Popeye's) and I'm not talking about someone having a bad day at the register. I'm talking about shameful, rude, arrogance beyond comparison.No...I will never go back to this ghetto excuse for a Popeye's.  This chain restaurant franchise has earned my "Restaurant Most Deserving of Implosion" award for this year. There is no excuse for the racism displayed by these people, and no excuse for the clowning around behind the counter in view of the customers whom you attach nicknames to. Evil, evil people.Grr.
Boudreaux's Louisiana Kitchen=Wow, how is it possible for a Cajun place to have so little flavor? Everything here was completely bland, uninspired, and barely resembled the amazing food that comes out of New Orleans. I've seriously had better Lean Cuisines than what we ordered. It probably didn't help that we came a few days before Christmas, originally planning to eat at Revolution Pizza across the street, but having to settle on Boudreaux's because Revolution was closed for the holidays. As soon as we walked in you could feel the nasty cigarette smoke in the air (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385694117/in/set-72157623503537096/), I definitely do not miss that about North Carolina restaurants.After waiting well over 10 minutes, someone finally came by our table to bring us some water, but they didn't take our order. We waited another 10 minutes to at least see a waiter, and I finally got impatient, went over the bar, and asked who the hell we could give our order to because we had stuff to do besides sit around in an empty restaurant. Apparently there was some confusion over who was supposed to take our table, and instead of figuring out which of them should do it they though the best course of action was to ignore us completely, not smart.Since we were already delayed a good bit due to the slow service, I decided to only get one appetizer for the table, the gator bites. I really love the flavor and texture of gator when cooked properly, and my mom or Nicole had never had it before, so I wanted them to try it as well. The pieces we got were pretty miniscule (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385694465/in/set-72157623503537096/), and the plate as a whole wasn't much in size or appearance. They basically charge you for novelty, and then make it as generic as possible. In fact, the pieces were so small, some bites wound up being more breading than meat, really sad. The cajun "mayeaux" was also far too creamy, and too much mayo and not enough cajun.I ordered the shrimp and crawfish etouffe as my main lunch item, as I generally love anything cooked in a good roux. This was another tragic failure. The shrimp were not cooked properly, and the crawfish was virtually missing. The roux was a sloppy mess (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386459240/in/set-72157623503537096/), and even the cornbread was doughy instead of crumbly. Worst of all, there was NO flavor, it tasted so horribly bland. Etouffee is supposed to be one of the crown jewels of Creole cuisine and they butchered it.My mom ordered the blackened chicken salad, which sadly was probably the best thing at the table, but unfortunately it too was still lacking any solid flavors. How you manage to cook something "blackened" and leave it devoid of any charred or spicy flavors is beyond me, but it looked like they just rubbed some red pepper on and prepared it normally. I didn't even bother trying Nicole's oyster po'boy, because the baguette was completely ruined (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385695997/in/set-72157623503537096/). The bread was practically crunching off like charcoal with each bite she took, and the oysters themselves were tiny and fried for entirely too long. The fries were edible, but overcooked as well, and probably sitting for a while because they weren't very warm.How much of this horrible meal was due to it being Christmas week and them probably understaffed and under-enthused about having to work I'm not really sure, and I honestly don't care. If you're going to be open you should treat every day the same, and give customers the same quality of service you normally would, otherwise give everyone a 50% discount for your 50% effort.Date night with Mrs. K., we headed to NoDa of course!On a Saturday night, there was a solid wait for a table - 45 minutes. We spent it wandering the nearby neighborhood and were only accosted by one "upper class" beggar who wanted "a dollar toward a vegetarian burrito, man". Love NoDa!We started with the "Gator Bites" - a small plate of battered and fried alligator tail. Despite living in South Florida for a decade, I've somehow managed to miss out on this delicacy. Tender and rather buttery, you should give it a try.For our mains, I chose the day's special - a half-rack of St. Louis Ribs which came with an ear of corn and cole slaw and fries. I cleaned the plate. I love ribs and these were particularly fall-off-the-bone. My date chose the blackened steak, which she said was cooked perfectly and the side greens were excellent.I would have thought that after a meal like this we would have been stuffed solid, but our lovely waitress managed to convince us to share a bread pudding and cappuccino.Great meal, great service, great date. We will absolutely be back!Okay - confession #1) the waitress from Davidson Street Public House said if you're going there next, order the Red Beans and Rice with Andouille Sausage. Confession #2) we peeked in and there was no one in Boudreaux's at the time - it was bright, empty and I didn't want to feel like I was on display in a fishbowl, so we ordered and had the food delivered to Sanctuary. Holy Yapple Dapple Yabba Freakin' Doo! Tasted like they have been stewing/cooking those beans all day long - jam packed with flavor and spices. Nice consistency to the rice (not overcooked). Let's not forget the sausage - nice portion with just a little heat. Great choice of eats for a pub crawl or foodie crawl. If I remember correctly too, it was under ten bucks. Will definitely be back to try the Jambalaya that Kelly C raved about!Boudreaux's Louisiana Kitchen was the first place my coworker and I went to in Charlotte.  Mostly because I was craving Shrimp and Grits!  It's been a while since I had some Southern food.  Overall, based on the dish, pretty good.
Roma Deli & Restaurant=I could have sworn I had a review for this place! Since I have no idea where it went, I guess write a new one.I really love this place. Welcoming, great service and lots of good food make this place one of my favorite Italian eateries. They have lots of lunch specials and reasonable prices, as well as a dinner menu that won't break the bank. Their desserts, deli counter and breads are always fresh and plentiful, so it's a good place to pick up food to go.I'm not a big pasta eater, but they cook their pasta well and all the dishes I have had here have been delicious. Some of my favorites are the linguini with clams, eggplant parm sandwich and many of their lunch and dinner specials are outstanding as well.I prefer the other location but can't put my finger on why. Service is quick, product is good, the sandwiches and salads are what I prefer to get. Space also includes a small deli, bakery, and grocery area, with cannoli, San Marzano tomatoes, and various meats and cheeses. They do offer takeout and delivery, and dine-in does include table service for dinner.Their chicken or eggplant parm sandwiches are heavenly, with fresh bread, tons of gooey cheese, and a large portion. The calamari salad is a bit plain, but fresh, so I tend to go for the greek- add chicken if this is intended as a meal.Downside to this location is the parking situation- I often come by to a full lot and have to pull out on the busy street, turn into another adjacent lot, repark, and walk over. If you want a great sandwich though, it's worth the (admittedly minimal) hassle.
El Norteño=The ultimate panacea for a hangover:-THC-H2O-Burritos from El Norteno. Sunday I awoke with a headache that could reduce a lesser man to renouncing alcohol. Rather than do something so drastic and foolish, I opted to meander wearily down 7th ave to El Norteno. Riding my bike there in the already intolerable morning sunshine I fantasized about what I would order; savoury green chile pork, creamy pollo fundido, succulent machaca beef, mountains of delicious beans, gooey melted cheese, gallons of horchata. My goal was to be the fat and happy mexican version of Augustus Gloop, drowning myself in beans rice and horchata, while small guatemalan oompa loompas admonished me in song. Thick in the midst of daydream I nearly rode my bike into oncoming traffic on 7th ave. A wandering homeless man gave me a look that suggested "what the hell is this guys problem?", I shrugged my shoulders and waited at the cross walk. Staring expectantly at my destination, mouth agape, drooling, raving and mumbling, unaware of my surroundings, tortillas and tacos and tostadas danced around my head like little hallucinatory mariachis. The homeless guy I saw earlier managed to catch up to me at the cross walk, and again he stared dumbfounded, with the same look. I paid him no heed, I was so close to my goal, if only the light would turn!! Finally the punishment light turned and I rode across, once there, I realized there was no where I could safely lock my bike up, and in this area, I'd either lock it up, or end up walking home. I walked it a little up the street and found sound rod iron gates I could hook the u-lock around. I start walking back and I see the same homeless dude go inside ahead of me, I cursed my luck and followed him into the cramped little closet of an area inside where you place your order. The homeless guy,....lets call him Thurston, was third in line behind two portly Hispanic guys, assumedly father and son. I sat and sat cramped behind the three ahead of me. Thurston finally got his chance to place an order and opted for two! mexican pizza's. Again I cursed my luck, knowing how long it would take to actually get my food. After Thurston placed his order he stepped outside into the glaring sunshine. I got up, rubbed my hands together rapidly, and stepped up to the counter. I chose the pollo fundido plate and a carne asada cheese crisp with horchata, and after waiting eagerly my number was finally called. I grabbed my order, headed to the little eating area, and promplty blacked out, apparently over dosing on mexican food.
Esmeralda's Cafe=I still remember going to Esmeralda's as a little girl. My mothers boyfriend at the time was Salvadorian so we would frequent it a lot back in the late nineties, early two thousands. Not a lot has changed since then. I still come from time to time, sometimes I call in an order and pick it up for lunch. I don't work too far so it's a cheap, convenient meal. The pupusas are really good and a steal at $1.50 each, although I do prefer the revueltas versus the other filling options they offer, they come with a red salsa and curtido (chopped cabbage in vinegar). The platanos fritos con crema y frijol are also really good, I love dipping the plantains in the beans, it's mix of sweetness and saltiness that I can tolerate without being grossed out. To wash your meal down, I recommend an ensalada. It's a homemade fruit drink with little chunks of apple. I've never had a problem with service, there is normally a sweet older lady that hands me my order, other times, a younger woman replaces her, let's just say she's not the friendliest, she's very cold in comparison, doesn't smile, and just seems miserable, but she is never rude.
L'Etoile=***L'Etoile is a very good contemporary fine dining restaurant, but it is also a great showcase of Midwestern farms, Wisconsin cheese and grass fed beef***More than any restaurant I have tried in the Midwest, L'Etoile is truly committed to local, seasonal cuisine.  The back of the menu lists the many local farms that L'Etoile uses to produce its contemporary fine dining cuisine and the freshness and quality really come across.  A lot of their produce burst with flavor and freshness that is easy to find in California but difficult to find elsewhere.In addition to the fresh ingredients, L'Etoile utilizes a lot of premium ingredients like chanterelles, high quality prosciutto, buttery and velvety foie gras, and grass fed, dry aged beef. The kitchen also shows great versatility whether it is a fresh and vibrant salad like their tomato, cantaloupe, arugula, and prosciutto salad, an intense and refined fine dining dish like their foie gras with sweet corn, chanterelles and blueberry gastrique or a hearty Midwestern dish like their New York Strip with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and bearnaise.I enjoyed all the savory courses I had.  Their cantaloupe in their starter salad had a great sweetness and the aftertaste of that fruit was mellowed out.  In addition, the dish was one of the menu items utilizing Asian ingredients (the head chef Tory Miller has an Asian heritage).  The cantaloupe was marinated like kimchi to provided a nice spiciness.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#1Dm_XzeFUsGbh-7ea6UYpwThe seared foie gras was very good--buttery and creamy on the inside and a slightly crispy exterior.  All of the garnishes stood out--earthy chanterelles, very sweet summer corn and a sweet and tart blueberry gastrique.  I think the dish could have benefitted from brioche, a crumble or a streusel because of the creaminess of the dish.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#kZci-HIMA6X0QDqBEI8hxwThey do beef very well here.  They source from a farm that dry ages their beef. L'Etoile then performs additional dry aging.  With dry aging, you can make the meat more flavorful but which can sacrifice juiciness.  That was not the case here.  Despite being a New York Strip and being dry aged, the meat was very tender and juicy.The meat also had a really strong beef flavor, which you do not always get (even with good beef).  The outside crust was also good--slightly crisp and very flavorful.  The side of mashed potatoes was also very good--rich and very thick (like good French pomme purée).  The other sides (like overcooked shiitake mushrooms) were very ordinary--the kind of food you would get at a run of the mill steakhouse.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#X9QeW2cMEXDG8iUldS1h1QFor cheeses, they feature 30 varieties of cheese from Wisconsin.  I did not love the cow's milk cheese I had, but it was more because it was not my kind of cheese.  I like softer and creamier cheeses.  The cheese did have a complex flavor--nutty like gouda but also with salty Parmesan notes.  The garnishes were great--really flavorful and crisp walnut toast, spicy hazelnuts and a really good fruit paste of cherries and berries.For dessert, I had their warm polenta cake with blueberry compote.  The cake was good as was the blueberry topping.  The garnishes did not work though.  I liked the caramel corn but the regular corn (not treated in any way to produce a different texture) just did not work as a dessert. The sour cream and blueberry sorbet was icy and tart.  And given that the polenta cake was not incredibly sweet or rich, I think a good ice cream would have been the better way to go.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#VYKnzdgfn2KDV7hMZcgsgQService was excellent.  My server Jessica was very personable, polite and polished.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu, which made me very confident on what I was ordering.  Despite the many courses, the food came out at a very even pace.Prices are high at L'Etoile, but the quality is very good and portions on several items are very generous.L'Etoile occupies a very nice space. The room is elegant but also contemporary and the huge windows allow a lot of great natural light to fill the room as well as allow patrons to view Madison's picturesque and lively capital square.I have not dined at many restaurants in Wisconsin, but I would imagine that L'Etoile has to be one of the very best.  It is one of the best Midwestern restaurants I have been to outside of Chicago.  With its focus on local farms, Wisconsin cheese, high quality beef, and contemporary cooking techniques/styles, L'Etoile is a great restaurant to experience cuisine that reflects both the chef's formal training at great restaurants as well as the high quality food that the midwest has to offer.Parking via pay lots/structures is available.Earlier this month, I celebrated my birthday in L'Etoile. As a foodie and local food supporter, I have heard so many good words about this place. I have been wanting to try it out during my 5 years in Madison. We finally made the move this year. I came out the restaurant being somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong. Everything was fancy. The staff was very professional. The ambiance was really classy. Food was delicate.  I come in with full preparation of the steep price (otherwise I would not wait for 5 years). However, I can hardly justify the experience with the $90 per person bill. It is pretty clear to me that L'Etoile is overpriced. In terms of food, 4 of us got Charcuterie, Pork Belly, and another beets dish for appetizers. They are all good, but without any true highlight. The portion is smallish. After I ate the pork belly, I somewhat really missed the pork belly I had in the A Pig in the Fur Coat...I had Branzino for entree. The fish itself was pretty delicious, but standard. The vegetables on the side has a slight hint of brunt smell that I found pretty odd. My brother and his girlfriend had lamb rack and scallop. Very average dish that you can get in an upscale restaurant. The biggest trouble of the night came with the steak for my wife. Since she is pregnant, she could not take raw meat. Therefore she asked the steak to be medium-well, but the steak came on the table being medium-rare. She had to ask the kitchen to re-do her plate. I guess such thing always happens but I was not expecting in L'Etoile. For dessert, we shared a Creme Boulee. It was, again, very average and with too much cream on the top. I could not find a memorable dish from the dinner. The food was delicious, but it failed to surprise me. When I pay close to a hundred dollar per person for a dinner, I really hope to see something more exciting. Nor do I understand the numerous 5-star reviews for this restaurant. Maybe this is something not meant to be enjoyed by poor students. Overall, classy, delicate, but somehow empty and overpriced. Thus a 3 stars.I ate at L'Etoile several weeks back for my best friend's 30th birthday and had a really, really mixed experience.  It was so mixed that the only way I can really review it is to list the pros and cons out side by side:+ Wait staff was really friendly, and prompt.  + The menu was customized for her birthday+ The knife cuts and cooking of every protein and vegetable was pretty much perfect every time.+ The beef dish with anchovy beurre blanc was probably one of the best things I'll ever eat in my life.+ The foie gras square with port reduction is definitely the best foie gras I will probably ever have.+ The caramelle pork pasta was stunning.  Flavorful, tender, and simply magical.  I could eat a bowl of it everyday and die happy.+ The after-dinner treat of the dark chocolate strawberry rhubarb truffle and yuzu pâte de fruit was stunning.  Should've been on the main menu it was so heavenly.- They kept on bringing us bread and asking if we wanted more, almost as if to fill us up on it - this seems a little bit degrading for a restaurant of this supposed caliber.- Several pairings just do not work.  Do not serve scallops with sweet potato and delicata squash - it is gross.  Do not serve foie gras pate inside a gougere with cranberry relish - it is dreadful and sour, and most definitely not in a good way.- The poached lobster in the lobster dish was rubbery and severely overcooked.  Squeaky and hard to get down.- The pastry chef doesn't know what they're doing.  The pumpkin mousse didn't taste of pumpkin, and the cranberry apple gastrique had far too much vinegar in it.  Sadly, there was far too much of it on the plate, making the whole dish become a vinegar and sugar bomb all at the same time.  The balance was nonexistent.In general, I guess it seems like they're really good with meats, but really terrible with fish and more importantly, balancing flavors with fish.  I probably would be back, but I would be extremely cautious about what I ordered.  They pick a lot of interesting and fun flavor combinations, but in our night out, a good half of them really fell flat.Had the 7-course tasting menu with wine pairing.  Totaled $205 per person.  Why do I mention price?  Because I don't really think it was worth it.  Sure, the food is good and the pairing worked well.  But the ingredients and flavors were hit-or-miss.  The scallop stole the show.  The lamb was great.  Octopus was a shame. But overall the food looked pretty but lacked the intense, complex, creative flavors I expect from a meal like this.  The service was acceptable but still felt very Madison (service in Madison is below par on average...sorry). In other words, it was a little too intrusive and 'peppy' for my taste.  A bit more professionalism and better grooming would help.  I still have trouble with the smooth jazz that they play in a space that still doesn't feel good.  Just feels a little cold and sterile overall.  Anyway, yeah, L'Etoile is good but the faux-pomp and sky-high prices just don't get me there.
Sacks Art of Sandwicherie=I was so disappointed by my lunch at Sacks today. It reminded me of a place in Albuquerque called Baggins... but they fell way short on customer service and quality. While the patio was pretty full, there was no line and I was able to walk right up to the counter to order. No greeting. She took my order, no explanation. Although, I prompted by saying, "This is my first time here." Counterworker just stared blankly until I asked, "So do I wait here or do you call my name?" The sandwich was fine: egg salad, cream cheese and bacon on multigrain bread. Not the best I've ever had. I ate half then turned to the bite sized cookie as my reward. It was hard as a rock! I didn't even finish the shard that I bit off. I don't see any real reason to go back.
Samurai Sam's=I went here for lunch last week. When I walked in the place was empty except for a lady behind the counter and a little boy about twelve. The little boy went behind the counter while I was ordering, and the lady proceeded to ask him to grab my egg role. He then proceeded to help her get the rest of my food. Needless to say I was a little grossed out. Apparently someone has never heard of food handler cards and that children are not to be in the kitchen much less handling the food. The food is decent but too often I go into these places and find workers sitting on the counter, talking on their phones while handling food etc. It's pretty gross. I'm told they don't have a c corporate number but someone definitely needs some retraining on handling food.There are three reasons I like Samurai Sam's: 1. Their teriyaki sauce 2. The low-cal options and the fact that I can chow down on an entire bowl of chicken, rice and veggies for four grams of fat3. The low-cal option for my fatty favorite, an egg roll -- four grams of fat.Yes this is a chain, but healthy chains get a star in my book so I'm giving to to Samurai Sam's. If there was only one closer to my home I would probably eat here way too much, but now I know that whenever I'm in the area, I will stop by and fill up on food that fills me without adding to the waistline. **** They also sell the teriyaki sauce.
Panera Bread=So sue me...I like a chain once in a while.  I mean c'mon, decent coffee, comfy seating, free wifi and more than passable lunches.Would you hate me if I told you I knew where pretty much every Panera was from Connecticut to Maine?Seriously.  Can I write one generic review and just post it for all of them?  I mean chains go for consistent theme and product, shouldn't consistent reviews with a certain sameness be bestowed upon them if they succeed?Is the Panera just off the Maine turnpike in Augusta where I ate dinner and worked late one evening that different than the Panera in between the Connecticut turnpike and the Merritt Parkway or the Panera just off of Fort Eddy Road in Concord, New Hampshire?  Frankly, no it's not.As previously mentioned, my office is within a stone's throw of this place, so it's safe to say that I've been here 30-40 times since the last review. I usually grab an iced tea during the day; if I'm pressed for time at lunch, I'll grab a salad or something light.+ Don't let the lines deter you; they'll get you in-and-out quickly+ Cashiers are always friendly and helpful+ Menu changes frequently, especially the special salads+ Current favorite: Chicken Hummus Power Salad - it's quite tasty & very healthy+ Solid chicken noodle soup; consistently good- Items are a bit pricey (the aforementioned salad with a large iced tea is $10+)+ I dig the new buzzer system that alerts you when your meal is ready+ Great to-go containers- Needs a little more waiting room/space; tends to back-up during rushes+ Decent coffee+ Good rewards program for frequent diners/patrons+ Generally kept very cleanI'm originally from St Louis, so I understand why I couldn't find St. Louis Bread Co...I love the pecan rolls and coffee oh and wifi to read news. Place is very clean, I think the girl taking order was stressed that day. But no biggie I got my food fast and coffee was hot so no complaints.
Pho An Hoa=Forget Pho Real (because it's not good and worth it) this restaurant is the best pho restaurant near my house. This is the restaurant I would go to if I had a craving for pho, and because I basically live right next to a string of pho restaurants I get to have a picking. Ben Thanh is right next door and I have tried both, so you can say I have experience of which one is better.Coming in here, the dining area is basically an extended hallway. Tables line right next to the windows and in the back, there are bathrooms. I remember back back in the day when I was a youngling, there used to be an arcade and my brother and I would go and play Galatica. Darn Aliens! Anyways, since the years have passed there have been several owners and now it's nicer and cleaner.I usually order either Goi Cuon (Fresh spring rolls) or Cha Gio (Fried spring rolls) along with my Dac Biet (Pho with basically everything in it). The reason why I say this place is better than most Pho restaurants is because:1. It's cheap. Pho, shouldn't be expensive.2. The amount you get is well worth the money. The amount of noodles compared to other places is a huge difference. If you get the largest size, I guarantee you'll be full. In comparison to other places where the portions are so ridiculous, even if you order their largest size you're still hungry after.3.  The broth and quality of the soup. Yes, maybe some other places have a better broth, but lets face it... We're here for the noodles and everything else that comes with it, not the soup. However, the soup does flavor the noodles and gives the overall dish its umph. But, if there's more soup than noodles that's where the problem lies.So you must be wondering what Dac Biet is. Dac Biet is basically Pho (thin rice noodles) and inside the broth comes the meats. Of course there's different types of meats you can order, but Dac Biet is basically a combination of all the meats. So Tripe, Meatballs, Tendon, Beef Flank, etc. There's a good amount of meat in this, which is why I crave it so.Overall, this place is delicious. An Hoa is a hole in the wall type of place, but you know what that means. They have best stuff, well at least around this area. (For the South Side, look for my review of Saigon Palace) But overall, if you're in the area and craving for Pho come here and you won't be disappointed.
Pino's Pizza Al Centro=Great neighborhood dining.  Pino really makes the place worth the visit.  His Southern Italian charm and care really shine in the way the food is prepared and guests are served.I recommend that you always review the daily specials before making a decision.  If there is nothing that meets your tastes then the following two dishes receive my personal guarantee.- Spaghetti Bolognese: Don't eat it all because it is better the next day.- Calzone: I defy you to find a better one in Phoenix.Having a class at Phoenix College from 1 to 2 works out pretty well for the fat girl trapped inside of my skinny body. I'm on a mission to try new places everyday after class since it's near central Phoenix. Anywayyyy, I have passed by this place a bunch of times and I finally decided to look it up on yelp...it had such good reviews on yelp! I was so excited to try it! After class, I drive my happy ass down there and I walk in and thought it was closed...I was going to get my order to go but I had time to kill so I decided to have it there. I went with the margherita pizza. So there were cons with my experience but the one that took the cake was this: a lady (I presume it was the owners wife) and some guy were sitting there having some sort of meeting about getting new wines...this lady looked like she had done meth for too long and botched plastic surgery; what a bitch she was. She was talking down to the girl in front, she was discussing the fact that she wanted to fly to Texas and beat her kids ass (how pleasant. At that moment I wanted to beat her ass). Then she starts talking about how DUMB college graduates are these days...umm...hello! College graduate here! Then she makes eye contact with me and asks me what I ordered. So weird. The guy sitting there was nice though. I felt bad for having to deal with her. The owner was there...he didn't say hi to me. He didn't ask how the pizza was, he didn't do anything. Maybe I'm spoiled but owners usually love me...especially Italian ones. Onto the pizza. It was good. It wasn't anything spectacular. I've had better. I wouldn't ever go out of my way to go there. Actually I wouldn't even go there if I ran into the place. So disappointing!
Habib's Persian Cuisine=I called to inquire about their menu and was meet with some resistance. the person who answered the phone would only tell me to come in and see the decor and and menu. i thought it was a joke and asked again but to no avail didn't get anywhere. this place put a bad taste in my mouth...ssh.This was the worst Persian food I have ever had. The service was even worse than the food. I will never go there again, I have been in many persian restaurants in LA and the Bay Area, this one stands at the bottom of the list. I recommend anything else but Habib.NO STAR! Went to Habib's with my elder parents/family, Habib the owner also server snapped impatiently right when we walked-in to get seated.  He seemed to be having a bad day and took it out on my parents and I.  He took my moms order and when my mom mentioned she does not want her food overly cooked he was impatient and rude.  My dad wanted to get seated over by the window and he was denied.  When he asked for an explanation, Habib said to him I'm diabetic and can not carry the food from the kitchen to the widow seat near the entry where my dad preferred to get seated.  Habib said to my dad I'm the owner also management here and I won't allow you to sit there if you don't like it then leave.  By then Habib had taken five of our orders, when it was my turn to order, I was the only one at the table who's order was not taken by Habib, taken-back by Habib's rude behavior I set down the menu and didn't want to order food, therefore, he asked me to leave on front of my family and raced to my seat as well as personal space as if he's going to hit me.  I got up, words were exchanged and he ran to the front grabbing a phone and threatening to call the police.  We were certainly not treated with any respect.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE.  Habib is a rude jerk and don't know what else to say. That was 30 minutes into our arrival to Las Vegas and starting our family vacation.I took a party of 6 friends and co-workers there last week when attending a tradeshow in Vegas ... I will never do that again!Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as "tax" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip?  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  3. Why is listed as "tax"?  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge?  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.  I will not recommend this place:  not for food, not for service and not for being overcharged!It was 4:00 pm when we got there. It is a very nice place . But Nobody was in the front desk like 5 minutes. A young boy who doesn't know anything about being a waiter showed up. Led us to a table . then we waited like 15 min to be taken an order. Finally , after 35 min we received our lunch while it was not fresh.we asked for the owner after 10 min he showed up. The owner couldn't stand to even listen our opinion.Any way , i don't recommend expecting good service over there.Amazing quality and freshness hidden in an unassuming location. The exterior really doesn't reflect the prices and service you'll find here- I can see some people walking in, taking one look at the menu and hightailing it out. I was almost one of them! But BF insisted we stick around, because years ago he was blown away by the food.I am happy to agree that the food, years later, is still legitimately amazing. The bread basket has three different kinds of pita and other carby deliciousness, which all go perfectly with the HERBS & FETA appetizer ($7), plated with fresh mint, tarragon, basil, and vegetables. The KOOBIDEH and CHICKEN KABOB plates ($15/ea) both had heaps of heavenly rice and roasted tomatoes, plus tender and well-seasoned skewers. The chicken was some of the best I've had, juicy and flavorful throughout.They have a variety of kabob plates and more traditional dishes like stews, but the prices are going to be steeper than you expect- average entrée is $20-30 but again, the quality is top notch. The service also deserves a shout out, as the staff are exceedingly professional. Interior is much classier than the location and exterior might suggest. Heavy carved wood chairs, white linen table clothes, fresh flowers on each table. Your date may even get a long-stemmed rose with the check!Don't forget to check out the attached grocery market on your way out.
McDonald's=I currently view McDonald's as more of a restaurant serving inexpensive snacks than meals. In my opinion, McDonald's is a level or few below the fast food powerhouses starring In N Out, Raising Cane's, and Panda Express. When dinner is far in the horizon and I want to calm my appetite, I order off the McDonald's $1 menu as I look forward to a better meal. The $1 menu features large fountain Coke beverages, a sausage buritto, a hot & spicy chicken sandwich, a double cheeseburger,  small coffee, and other foods.   Both my check-ins here were when I hiked on the Angel Park Trail system. This McDonald's is convenient to the Angel Park Trail system; which includes the Bonanza Trail, Kellogg Sport's Complex, and Lone Mountain Trail. The restaurant is a convenient respite from outdoor activities. To reach this McDonald's from the Angel Park Trail system; from Bonanza Trail which is really the east spur of Angel Park Trail to you'd walk past the Kellogg Sport's Complex, walk under the Buffalo Drive tunnel and after the K-Mart turn left on Lone Mountain Trail. After Crossing Washington Avenue with a pedestrian signal, you'd turn left and McDonald's is on the right.  As far as location,  I am curious why McDonald's passed over building the restaurant at the corner of Buffalo at Washington. The existing restaurant a few thousand feet east of Buffalo Drive on Washington Avenue is out of sight lines for motorists driving on Buffalo Drive one traffic signal north of Summerlin Parkway. Then again being McDonald's there is another location a couple of traffic lights north at Buffalo and Lake Mead Boulevard.    This is an older McDonald's. This is not surprising considering it is near Kmart. There is no theme. Just a basic McDonald's with a dining and indoor playground area.  The two check-ins in this basic McDonald's were for a snack. On my first check-in,  I quaffed down the limited time Chocolate strawberry Frape. It was a yummy caffeine boost at a cost of $4 and 600-plus calories. Fortunately this was the halfway point of my hike and I'd burn some of it off. On my follow-up check-in,  I snacked on a Hot & Spicy Chicken with a large Coke. The Coke was flat. That is a no no! If the service wasn't decent and there wasn't a manager presence, this review would fall flat of 3 stars and sink to 2 stars.   I try to review places when I am a regular. Now that I am a Duke that will probably see that status fade at this location, it is time to emphasize that this is a decent restaurant for a snack or light meal off the Angel Park Trail system and in the vicinity of Washington at Buffalo.This has got to be one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever had the pleasure of waiting in line for! I only ordered medium sized french fries and a hot chocolate, and it took at least 20 minutes to finally get my order!  And to top that off, when it was finally my turn at the window, it took them 5 minutes to open the window to tell me that my order will be ready shortly! You may think I am exaggerating, but I am not! Hopefully my next time there will not be as horrendous!This McDonald's is connected to the Terrible's convenience store/gas station and not particularly one of my favorites.It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby.The last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen.  Apparently she was on break (and eating) and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues, so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they, in turn, hollered back.  Very professional group here.I'm sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well.ahhhhh just got home after getting drive thru at this location. i really considered turning around and going back but gave up on the thought. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of BBQ sauce. heres what i gota spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere. a medium fry that was literally half full, honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating, it was about a third full. and guess what no BBQ sauce BUT an open ketchup packet that got everywhere. BRAVO... BRAVO. and this is why i rarely eat fast food.After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango.  I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack.  Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy.  Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88.A shiny, bronzed group of Chicken McNuggets with formed pretend-tatoes in a 4-color box served by a high-school student or college intern and a toy to boot?? From the drive-thru even? Where can I  pay money?? I  want to pay real money for this! And afterward, I  want to gas up my car, yup! Then I  want to play bad vintage top 40 music blasting on my factory car radio system "I  wanna be a cowboy. And you can be my cowgirl."I  showed up at 430am looking for a quarter pounder and they were only serving breakfast, even though the sign says differently. Another time I  showed up at 1030am and tried to order breakfast and they stopped serving breakfast.I  really think this Mickey D's is cray cray adorbs. 4 r e al z.
Smoky's Club=The last time I was in Smoky's was back in 1989.  I was in high school, rockin' a perm, sportin' my Z Cavarrici pants, a mock turtleneck, and kickin' some Air Jordans (no, seriously).  All I remember from that experience were the relish tray and the sizzling hot plates that the steaks arrived on.Fast forward 23 years.I was invited to a dinner with two very good friends and they suggested we hit Smoky's.  The three of us arrived to Smoky's at around 7pm on Saturday, found a parking spot, and wandered in to the fabled establishment (sans my Z Cav's - I left them at home).We took a seat at the horseshoe-shaped bar, where Madison's infamous mixologist, "Martini Bob," greeted us as if we were long-lost friends.  What an outstanding guy - friendly, personable, and more than capable of creating a mind-bending beverage.  My pals went with martinis; I chose a brew.The tap selection was modest but decent; I opted for a Samuel Adams Lager.  I wasn't old enough to drink during my previous visit, but I imagine the bar hasn't changed much since the 80s.  And that's A-OK by me.  The place was cozy, comfortable, and truly enjoyable.  After a few sips of our beverages, we ordered some breaded mushrooms with the house-made ranch sauce.  Both arrived in short order and boy-howdy, were they excellent.  I'd highly recommend giving them a shot.A host dropped by to ask if we'd like to grab a table; we did, and were led into one of the smaller dining room areas.  A four-top table awaited, complete with a relish bowl that consisted of carrots, celery, scallions, and radishes.  I'd swear I could hear the theme song from "Saved By The Bell" ringing in my ears.An incredibly friendly server dropped by with menus and to check on the status of our drinks.  We ordered a glass of Cabernet and browsed the menu.After a very short wait, we placed our orders - three fillets (medium rare), hashbrowns, and mushrooms.  When given the option between a glass of tomato juice or a basil tomato soup, we went for the soup.Bob dropped by to see how we were doing, and inquired about our wine choice.  He suggested a Malbec rather than the Cab, and went to get us a sample.  Upon his return, we took a sip and agreed the Malbec was the better bet.  Bob is awesome.  Totally awesome.Cups of soup, along with a bread basket arrived in short order.  The soup was fantastic - hints of basil complimented the tomato flavor; I sopped-up the remainder of my soup with some bread... manners-be-damned... Salads arrived and consisted of fresh greens, homemade croutons, a little onion, and a few cherry tomatoes.  And before you could say Murphy Brown, our steaks were presented - sizzling hot plates and all!  I giggled with delight, and then drooled with anticipation as I spied the hashbrowns - the plate of crispy goodness looked awesome.We cut into our uber-thick steaks and they were perfectly cooked - a stunning medium rare.  Content with our bounty, the waiter left us to our meals.  The steaks were superb.  Super tender, full of flavor and just divine.  The hashbrowns were as stellar as they looked - crispy yet tender and surprisingly flavorful.  A side of mushrooms rounded out the flavor profiles - I'd recommend you get these as well.All in all, this was an other-worldly experience, and I can't wait to go back.  The price was more than fair; service was top-notch; the food was as good as I've ever had.  It looks like they've also refreshed the dining rooms a bit.Smoky's = WINFood = 4.75 starsService = 4.75 starsValue = 4.75 starsMISC = 5 starsI really didn't know what to expect. I drive by Smoky's Club every week and it easily goes unnoticed. Coming here was like meeting the quiet kid in the back and realizing this was the most interesting person in the room. I almost ordered the veggie lasagna, but then my red wine came so I went for steak. The steak comes sizzling on a metal platter. You can salt and pepper it if you like, but what more do you need than well-sizzled meat. A relish bucket filled with ice, crunchy radishes, carrots, celery, and curling scallions will sit at your table for dipping into between bites of steak. Is this what eating is supposed to be like? I have not yet lived.  They have a house Roquefort dressing, which is like french dressing with chunks of blue cheese. Another house specialty, their hashbrowns, come round, crispety and buttery. The tables are uncluttered, no caddies hovering with crusty A1 bottles, as this place keeps it classy. And the napkins were so soft. Is it paper? Is it cloth? I haven't gotten to the best part -- the attention to service. No small talk, just an announcement of the soup and featured vegetable of the day. When soup arrived, the bowl was carefully turned so the spoon was facing my dominant hand. We were asked minimal questions like, "do you have everything you need?" at which point we did request ketchup and it came promptly and with purpose. Our waters were filled in comfortable silence. No desserts or drinks were pushed on us. No lecture on how hot the plate would be. It's hard to describe the absence of something, but we were treated like people with sense and autonomy, and it was glamorous. As we left, I wondered if this place could be the Ritz-Carlton of steakhouses. Or...just a regular supper club. Had I been living under a rock?The best martini list I have ever seen--the menu is thicker than the Monday New York Times. Martinis range from sweet to tart and spicy with a lot of great variation. The portions are extremely generous. After 1 I was in probably one of the best moods I've ever been in. A friend described the martinis as "betch bomb good". I'm not sure what that means but I agree. Atmosphere is relatively quiet and laid back. There is enough room for a party or a small group of friends. And on the plus side, it's easy to reach and on a bunch of bus lines (safe driving!). I love this place
Joey's Pizza=I was in the area for work and stopped in for a salad- the space is literally a walkup counter with a couple of benches, definitely a takeout-only kind of space. There aren't any pics posted of the menu, and there wasn't one available for me to take, so for a basic overview, they have pizza, calzones, burgers, sandwiches, gyros, chicken fingers/wings, and a ton of apps (fries, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, etc). Oh, and salads- three kinds. I opted for the grilled chicken, and there was ample protein and the portion was large. Priced at $9, the produce was super fresh, and there was a choice of three dressings. The house blue cheese tasted like a low-priced bulk-jar generic, but it was certainly one of the larger, fresher salads I've had at a run-down pizza joint.Service was friendly and fast. Space doesn't have much ambiance. They have a 75-cent credit card charge. Prices are fairly low and portions across the board seem to be large, based on other orders I saw being picked up.
Full Belly Deli=I was on my way to Port of Subs but it was crazy packed and I hate crowds so I kept driving and found this place thought I'd give it a try. Oops My bad!! The kid was nice behind the counter when I asked what was good. I ordered what he suggested a 6 inch Italian type club for my meat eating brother and a what seemed harmless enough a stuffed tomato w egg salad for myself along w drinks, chips, and a cookie for the kid to go. It was $17. He even gave me a box to carry the drinks safely! I get to my bro's and we sit down to eat. I open my box and it was ahem a layer of lettuce on the bottom with a totally unripe light pink tomato cut into wedges w the egg salad poured on top. Ummmm it was bad folks I couldn't even bare to take a picture. There was nothing good about this or worth the $6 it cost. My bro is like Mikey he will eat anything well he ate the sandwich but it was drenched with ranch WTF I dont remember asking for ranch. It also had the same pink tomato's in it. Honestly not sure how this place stays open when even Subway would be better. This place gets 2 thumbs down. Maybe breakfast would be better!?!?
Claim Jumper=So, I moved back to the Bay Area 6 years ago this week. Last week, I was in Phoenix and met with some friends from high school who I haven't seen in 9 and 11 years respectively. Our 20 year HS reunion is next month and since I am not going, decided we should have our own mini type reunion and this was a place easy enough for all of us to meet up. Yes this is a chain, and yes when in Phoenix I play the chain game. When this restaurant was built, it was all the rage. I used to work for a company close by and this was the place we would go to for recognition type lunches, etc. The portions were huge, there was a salad bar (yep this seems eons ago) and service was great. There was always a line and if you showed up at dinner time, you had to be prepared for a 1+ hour wait. We all met at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. No line outside, no one waiting inside and we were seated immediately. This told me right away that either the economy has taken a real toll or that the Claim Jumper isn't jumping anymore. We were seated and all just started gabbing away. We all had non alcoholic beverages and warned the waitress we would be there for the long haul with gabbing, etc. so if she needed us to leave so she could get more tables to let us know. Heads up folks visiting AZ from CA-any wait staff in AZ DOES NOT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE. They make around $4.25 an hour now (used to be $2.12) and have to depend on tips. This is why I find service in AZ to typically be stellar compared to service here. They have a smaller menu than they used to and also offer smaller plates. We all had something different-me a spinach salad and a big ass baked potato. My friends had a chicken sandwich of sorts and the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. We were all satisfied and my friends each took part of their meal home. We also all shared a coffee ice cream mud pie. It didn't taste as good as I remembered it, but it was a nice end to the meal. The desserts are still larger than life and even with 3 women gabbing and noshing, we left about a third of it. The waitress was great-the restaurant still never got busy and we ended up closing the place down (that would be 10pm)! The three of us then ended up sitting outside in front of the restaurant and gabbed and gabbed until well after midnight. It was a great evening and a nice place to have played catch up with old friends (none of us are 40 yet so they wouldn't like me calling them "old"). I drove back to my mom's and parked the car, took off my shoes and walked through the house on my tip toes. Kind of like how I used to come home in high school but I wasn't drunk or stoned...I normally hold off on writing reviews for chain places but I met up with some girlfriends for lunch on a Sunday that wanted to hear about my trip and they said let's do lunch at Claim Jumpers, so off I went.We were seated right away by the manager, who was very friendly & nice and our server for the meal was Vanessa, and let me tell you Vanessa loves her job she was superb job, she is what inspired me to write this review. From the start of the meal to the end of the meal she was present thoughtful and helpful even offered us some tea to go when we left. I was in the mood for a salad so I went with bbq chicken salad it was perfectly prepared but it visually it looked amazing, the greens, the red of the tomato so vivid in color, and the best part it tasted great too!I can honestly say that I haven't been to a Claim Jumpers in a few years and I am happy that I did that Sunday afternoon! Great company, great food, excellent service.
Garcia's Mexican Restaurants=Okay, so hard to believe I am the FTR of this Garcia's location since it has been here for eon's (and looks like it) and is still one of the staple restaurants around the Metro Center area that hasn't closed down or changed. The food is the same as it has been for the last 15+ years. Decent, not great and sadly, the shredded beef in the taco I had tasted like it was boiled without any flavors or seasoning. For those of you reading this review who have never been to Phoenix (Arizona at all in fact) you may not be aware of the greasy deliciousness called a cheese crisp. This is seriously where it is at pretty much all over the Valley. Garcia's does make a fine cheese crisp and for that, I am still grateful and willing to go. The one good thing I can say is the restaurant still seems to have a hopping bar area with live music a few nights a week. Good for the happy hour crowd, but since I was there with my mom and a cousin for lunch, it didn't do anything for me knowing this. Word of warning to ladies who need to potty while in the restaurant area...The bathroom is as old as the rest of the place. One toilet so if you drink a lot, be prepared to wait your turn.
Golden Flower Chinese Cuisine=This was a surprisingly very pleasant find for fine and stalwart, dead-ahead Cantonese cuisine!  Complimentary fried sticks presented in a small bowl were tasty dipped in the fragrant Sweet and Sour Sauce provided.  Egg Drop Soup was among the best I have ever tried.  And, Wor Won Ton Soup was very fine, with chicken, shrimp, pork, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, carrots, bok choy, napa cabbage, and excellent pork-filled wontons.  Pan-fried Potstickers were simple but very good, and I was cheerfully supplied with all of my favorite dipping sauces.  Springy Vegetarian Egg Rolls were greasy but good, and as another appetizer very breaded Fried Shrimp were shaped in fat circles, but juicy shrimp lay inside those massive rings.Orange Chicken was succulent.  Chicken Chow Mein was very good.  Walnut Shrimp was a little mayonnaisey but also quite tasty.  And the beef and snow peas in Beef with Pea Pods were tender and very good, as well.    Portions were huge!  In fact, our table for four diners was so laden with food that a man from an adjoining table came over to remark at what a fine feast we had laid out before us, and to tell us how much he enjoyed this restaurant.  When he learned that I would be reviewing the restaurant on Yelp.com he winced, saying that he hoped the secret of his neighborhood eatery would not leak out too far.  But it already has!  Golden Flower was the 2012 Staff Pick for Best Chinese Restaurant in Best of Las Vegas.  For good reason, as I learned!Service was friendly and impeccable.  The restaurant is small but seating was comfortable.  Prices are very reasonable.  In fact, the only negative thing that I can report is that the tea was not hot enough on the first run.  But this was quickly and cheerfully remedied with a new, steaming pot.When you crave Cantonese cuisine, this is a place that will most assuredly assuage that craving!BEST OF LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL 2012Okay, officially it's not quite in Hendertucky but it's darn close.  Just happens to be a couple miles northwest from my doctor's office off of Whitney Ranch and Sunset Roads. And we arrived within minutes of the curtailment of their luncheon specials of $5.95 & $6.95. We ordered their lunch specials Curry Chicken with wonton soup plus Spicy Shrimp Braised with hot & sour soup. Both of us agree it was most authentic and enjoyable. The wonton is made with a thick skin which is not our preference. Fried noodles accompanied by a dish of sweet & sour sauce plus mustard is a tell tale sign of their primary customer base.Now tell me where can you go for an entree accompanied with a heaping portion of bbq pork fried rice, bowl of soup, egg roll and crab puff for these prices?  If your first concern is about the quality and authenticity... the answer is nowhere else. If you're worried about quantity... you need not fret.We also ordered for takeout Beef Chow Fun and Singapore Rice Noodles. Their Beef Chow Fun is the best I've had had in Las Vegas in a long long time. Haven't gotten to the Singapore noodle entree. It's still in the refrigerator. I'll update this review when I get to the Singapore noodle.Wow after sitting bookmarked in my Yelp log I finally got my booty over to check out what all the fuss is about!We were not disappointed and found out first hand what all of the rave reviews were about!We started with a hot pot of Oolong tea which is a nice option and treat when dining out for Chinese and that is not always an option elsewhere.We ordered an appetizer of fried shrimp and it was yummy, the shrimp and the fried coating was delicious.We also decided on an order of sweet and sour shrimp which was very good as well! It was more of the same yummy fried shrimps mixed with carrots, onions, and bell pepper in a delicious sweet and sour sauce which comes with white rice.We also ordered almond chicken which was full of white meat chicken, generous fresh slithered almonds in an Amazing light brown sauce that had a hint of sweetness.This is a true Cantonese style Chinese restaurant which has always been my favorite.Golden Flower reminds me of the exceptional Cantonese restaurants we would eat at back in the 80's in the Pacific NW.The service is great and the prices are Outstanding especially considering their generous portions! Our bill for an appetizer and two full entrees was $24 which was ridiculous good considering all of the food we were served, we even had to take some home as we could not finish it all. The Quality, Service, Flavor, Portions and fair pricing is alive at the Golden Flower."After being on a cross country flight from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas to meet up with my brother and a week on vacationing on the Strip, I was anxious to see a real locals restaurant. My brother drove me to a nice Chinese restaurant in a happening Von's shopping center called Golden Flower. " In reality if Yelp was in existence ten years ago in the summer of 2014 this is how I would of started the review. Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant holds a place in my heart because it is one of if not the first locals Chinese restaurant that I visited in Las Vegas when I was living in Fort Lauderdale ten years ago. For at least ten years Golden Flower has been blooming in the very injured shopping center at the corner of Pecos and Russell Roads. Where this shopping centers Von's, Denny's, New York Bagel shop, Starbuck's, and so on rest in peace, the spirit of Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant is alive.   It was yesterday before I attended the Alcohol Awareness Training class that I wanted to take advantage of a nearby Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. After a near decade hiatus, I was returning to Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant.   Golden Flower is still the same cozy Chinese restaurant as I remember back when the Outcasts "Hey ya" was topping the charts. It brings back further memories of the cozy Chinese restaurants in Long Island, New York. The oldies from the 1980s and 1990s added to the relaxing environment. Listening to the acoustic version of "Hotel California" made each bite of the shrimp chow mein that much more enjoyable.   More than the cozy environment and music, the service left me with a better taste of the Golden Flower. From the time I stepped inside to when I paid, Christie was very welcoming. She invited me to sit at any table in the relatively small dining room that was sparsely populated by diners. She was on top of refills and would always say, "Thank you." Ultimately she never rushed me. I'd overhear a couple of customers thank Christie for the great service.   The luncheon specials are a good deal. They are in affect Monday to Saturday from 11 am to 3 pm. In similar style to the luncheon specials throughout the Las Vegas Valley the price is between $5.95 and $6.95. the reality is that when you add a glass of Coke, tip, and tax it comes out to the figure of $11. But the Coke could be unnecessary because I vividly recall the delicious hot tea here. Let me talk more about the lunch specials. They include either egg drop or hot and sour soup. But, if you love wonton soup like I do, it is $2.25 per person. There is more. The lunch special also includes an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce and spicy mustard and either BBQ pork fried rice or steamed rice. The lunch special features an entree. The choices include numerous styles of chow mein, pepper steak, curry chicken, and sweet and sour chicken (I posted a picture of the menu in this business listing).    I ordered the shrimp chow mein luncheon special. The crunchy noodles were decent. I am a fan of the wide noodles and not the skinny ones they serve here. Regardless they went good with the spicy mustard. Before I could get more acquainted with the noodles, Christie placed the hot and sour soup on the white tablecloth. The soup tasted hot and sour. The next visit I intend to pay the $2.25 for the wonton soup. The egg roll which reminded me of a spring roll was Panda Express allright. Now the portion of the shrimp chow mein with fried rice was enormous. The quality was magnificent. In a couple of my previous reviews on Las Vegas Chinese Restaurants I voice my opinion that the chow mein noodles are filler food. Golden Flower serves flavorful chow mein that hint of lo mein sprinkled with generous amounts of chunky juicy appetizing shrimp and sprinklers of onions. This is an example of both quantity and quality. The Best of Las Vegas has bestowed Golden Flower with The Best of Vegas awards in 2002, 2008, and 2012.  In hindsight, I am cognizant of the fact that somethings stay the same. In the period of a decade Golden Flower is still the same local Chinese Restaurant serving remarkable Chinese food luncheon specials in a cozy environment. In the period of a decade I remain a fan of Golden Flower.Mmmmmm I make a visit here for my Chinese cravings when I am in need of a mouth orgasm. They give it to me fresh, clean, and generous in which I always leave filled up just how I like.I tried the general so chicken on this last visit and boy I was in a sea of bliss with this delicious dish!I have been craving it since, I dream of it, I need it, I want it more and more.I have 12 check ins at Golden Flower and every single dish I try is just as Amazing. The staff is Fantastic, the food is top quality and the prices are low for the giant portions.Their war wonton soup is a delicious meal in itself as well for those cold nights! It is full to the brim with shrimp, bbq pork, chicken, veggies and wontons! A must try!
Luisa's Brick Oven=I wanted to enjoy this restaurant...I really did, considering that's it's locally owned and in the hot Montford area. However; my recent visit was a little disappointing. Decided to sit outside because there was a shady spot on the small patio area (3 tables). Was offered the buffet by the hostess and the waitress, but wanted to see the menu as well. While they were getting the menus I decided to check out the buffet. My initial reaction was a short giggle, as the buffet is just a few pizza choices (4-5) I believe, and a big stainless bowl that had salad it in and it looked like it was doused in dressing. Um, no thanks. Started with an order of the mozzarella sticks, which were good...nothing fancy. When asking the waitress what pizza she recommended she said I'm not sure, I don't eat it (hmmm?). I was a little taken back by that and asked the wife if I heard her correctly after she left and she said I did. Anyway, that comment aside, decided to get the eggplant special pizza with sun-dried tomatoes on the side. Special pizza is suppose to come with eggplant, provolone, garlic and parmesean. Then we added half of sun dried tomatoes. Even pointed to the menu to make sure the waitress got it right...size was 15". Well after the mozza sticks the pizza came out and at first glace I knew it was wrong because half the pizza had eggplant and the other half had sun dried tomatoes. The pizza also had so much oil/grease on it, I had to go back inside and get extra napkins to pat it down. Decided to let the obvious misorder go and try the pizza...sure enough, just a cheese pizza with a topping on each half. This was reaffirmed when the check came and it said 1/2 sun dried, 1/2 eggplant. Not what I ordered. A small item that no red pepper flakes were brought out or on the table so I had to go back inside and get them from a table. We were also charged for an extra drink we did not get. When I asked the waitress what the extra charge was she said it was for our 2 drinks. I reminded her politely that we only had 1 drink and a water. Without apologizing for the honest mistake, she just looked at the person I was paying and said remove a drink and walked away. All and all, a "eh" experience. Recommendations...spruce up the buffet and leave the dressing off the side and make sure the pizza is labeled and fresh. Also, better knowledge of the menu by the waitstaff so answering questions and looking for recommendations aren't returned with awkward responses. Bummer...potential is there...Ehhhh it breaks my heart to write less than stellar things about a pizza joint, even more so about a local pizza joint. I've been on the prowl for delicious pizza - of any kind (NY or Chicago) for more than three years now. Thus I was really, REALLY hoping that Luisa's dished out a delicious pie. The overall experience really left me with "meh."Hubs and I walked into Luisa's to enjoy a relaxed Friday afternoon meal and wanted to sit outside to enjoy the great weather. Our initial greeting from the gentleman (owner? manager?) was so sweet - he genuinely seemed happy to help us. I had high hopes at that point...and then our waitress took over and it went down hill...fast.We decided to forgo the buffet and order an appetizer of mozzarella sticks and a 'za - intending to take some home. The mozza sticks were good...however I've never had a bad piece of fried cheese. Then we waited for our 'za - not too long, though! In 15 - 20 minutes or so our pie came out...wrong. The waitress must have misinterpreted our order, but no worries...we decided to eat it anyway. That's all on us...not complaining about that. The problems were 1) the waitress never brought us silverware, red pepper flakes, extra napkins, etc., so hubs kept going inside to grab these necessary items. Tres annoying. 2) the pizza was full of grease. I'm normally a "pizza blotter" anyway, but this was an obscene amount of grease. Ack. After I blotted away, the pizza was just ok - not very inspired. Very little flavor and super bland. I expected a tasty, crispy crust too, considering the "brick oven"...but alas it was sub par. We brought the majority of the pizza home...and I don't think we ever ate it. That tells you something because I will typically eat pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As Todd W. said - we both really wanted to like Luisa's but it just fell short. Maybe the waitress and the brick ovens were having an off day? Sad 'za, sad face.Stopped by Luisa's for their lunch pizza deal and was pleased. While it's not great pizza, it is absolutely very good pizza. Brick oven baked, rather than the usual gas oven stuff, it is a bit more charred around the edges and this adds a different flavor - a good one - to the pie.The buffet has a salad which is nice and tasty, but don't decieve yourself into thinking that's a healthier choice than the pizza. It's got a good amaount of dressing on it. And really, you're at a pizza place. Have the pizza!And for the pizza choices, it was a nice variety though not spectacular. The focus here is on the tasty crust and not the creative toppings. What are you expecting for $9? Pepperoni and sausage and peppers and mushrooms and the like. The pesto-topped pizza was tasty.A very nice lunch option at a great lunch price for very tasty brick-oven pizza. I can see why Luisa's is so popular!
Fuddruckers=Back in the day, and I'm talking 1991/92, Fuddruckers was rad. They would receive whole sides of beef to grind for burgers, they baked everything in-house, made their own ice creams, had amazing table service, and had a relatively great soda jerk atmosphere. It was awesome. Now? It's kind of like the burger joint that time forgot. Sad people sitting multiple tables apart from one another whilst eating over-cooked meat on poorly-executed buns. Though the buns are baked fresh daily, they lack any sort of "pop" to showcase any deftness within the bakers' hands. Just sad and flavorless. The atmosphere seems to be more arcade-centric than food/service-centric. There are so many games on either side of the restaurant. It's pretty funny. I ordered the 1/2lb burger and asked for medium rare. What I received was a pretty fantastically well done patty of sadness. Even dressed with a few pickles and barbecue sauce, there was no seeing through the unfortunate event that happened in that kitchen. Bummer. Will I return? HA! No way. Fuddruckers used to be something wonderful. Now, it may just need to be put out to pasture. All puns intended.Pros... Quick, good, cooked right, self serve condiments, friendly staff. Good choice of size and type of meat. fresh buns, self serve drinks. Good Good Good.Cons... The place is a little run down, they sometimes no self serve trash bins.
Fatburger=I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.FOOD - 4 StarsI was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.After a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.I attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.Overall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  See the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.Will I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels.There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and this place is one of them. The food is made fresh to order. If you order inside or the drive-thru you should be prepared to wait. Since they are making it fresh it can take a while.First, get familiar with the size of the burgers here because they can get B-I-G! They have combo meals or you can easily just get a burger to satisfy your hunger.  Here are burger sizes:Small - 2.5ozMedium - 5.3ozLarge - 8ozXXL - 16ozXXXL - 24ozAs you can see they have a size for any stomach. There are also a nice variety of toppings you can add to your burger.They have a variety of crispy and grilled sandwich options. If you prefer turkey or veggie burgers they have them too!You can also choose from chicken strips, hot dogs, and salads.They have "fat" and "skinny" fries.Grilled onions, jalapenos, and peppers are available upon request.The shakes are ALL very good! Try one *if* you have room after your meal :)If you like breakfast check them out for that sometime they have a pretty good bacon and egg sandwich.now this is the "best" hamburger around. huge, thick & juicy really flavorful. the relish & pickles just kill. the onion rings were super-fresh hot & crispythis place is great-it doesn't matter where it's located in a food court or a stand-alone shop. they are always consistent. every thing is made to order. and the burgers always leave you wanting more. I lived across the street from in & out burger for 3 years-they are good but-fatburger is #1. always good service, fast & friendly staff, place is always clean & the decor is traditional burger stand. we love it!!!Get yourself a baby fat meal with fat fries & a shake you won't regret it. Voted Best Fast-Food Burger!
Joni's Capitol Cafe=This falls into the something to do before you die category. It's no longer called Joni's as Joni took off to run some other place. But the new owner's are awesome. So, there's a short order cook there named Mary. Imagine if the Soup Nazi was a shorter, slightly older woman and secretly the sweetest person on Earth once you put in your six years as a state employee and got to know her.  And imagine she makes a breakfast burrito so good you spend $3700 and hours standing in the line to order it over the course of your six years there. The breakfast burrito Mary makes is simply the best breakfast option in the state. No joke. I defy anyone to show me something better. Go there some morning. Order the burrito. Friday's there's chorizo. Change your life. Don't be afraid. There's a whole unexplored world out there. Tell her Dallas sent you and she may not yell at you for your shitty ordering technique.
Diner 50=When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in the get-toe, take yo' phat ass to Diner 50.Cool retro joint, nice staff, adequate diner food.You'll find it on 19th Ave somewhere between Van Buren and Buckeye. Someone told me it was there and I saw it with my own eyes. It's amazing inside! (Notice how I avoided speaking of the outside.)Not seeing a veggie burger option on the menu, I put in a special request for one of the burgers sans the meat patty. My preference for vegetarian eats was accommodated quite well with good customer service. They fixed me up with a sand-which actually turned out to be a veggie sloppy joe of mushrooms, zucchini, onions, and peppers on bun with lettuce and tomato. Juicy! A side of medium hand cut fries with skin on (yum!) came with. And for my sweet tooth - uh, I mean for the owners - just to let them know that the sign out front with 'apple pie' written in big letters was useful, I also ordered a slice of dessert. Dessert FirstDessert FirstDessert First(That's going to be the next movement I join. You should join too, it's very proactive.)By the way, other restaurants in the area are fast food and Mexican food.
Great Wall Buffet=What makes this americhino boofay different from all the rest? Nothing.It's just got decent quality consistency in the food.  Most of the service is also of a decent quality.  The variety is quite good for the price.  With mongollian grill included, your choices are just as much as at the super buffets, but a few bucks less out of pocket.  They've got a great coupon where weekday lunch between 2-3pm is only $3.99 drink included!
Come Back In=I never liked or disliked the Come Back In - it's a typical bar and has good beer choices.  They always offered me a chance for my band and I to play there, and exposure is always good.  However, I never liked the manager, since all he does every time is yell at his staff and glare at everyone.  He really creeps me out, the way he's always staring and crap.  Anyway, last time we were there, it was below zero outside.  We noticed a dick patron had left his yellow lab in his car with the windows all up and no blanket just to go inside and drink (people like that should never own anything that relies on them, btw) and he had been in the bar for a long time, because the windows were all nearly frosted over.  I mentioned this to the manager since he checked my ID at the door, and he said, "Who the fuck cares, it's a damned dog," and shooed me inside.  1. that is freaking RUDE to say to a CUSTOMER.  2. yes it is a dog, but that is animal cruelty.  I got a seat with my friends and kept an eye on the guy.  Sure enough, just like all other times, he yelled at his staff and glared at the customers, doing nothing else.  The cops showed up then and talked to him and he was pissed as all hell that someone (no, it wasn't me lol) called the cops to his establishment.  And yes, it was about the dog in the car in negative degree weather.  I was close enough to the situation to over hear it, and the guy was a dick to the cops too, saying things like "I don't f*cking care," and "who called you?!  Tell me!"  This guy is a real piece of work.  After the cops left, I decided I 1. never want to come here again unless it is managed by a more decent person and 2. never will accept their offer for my band to play in a place that is managed by this guy, who obviously hates his job, customers, staff and, well, life.  Until he is gone, I will never set foot in that place again.  And, as I was leaving (he was yelling at staff at that time), I told him just that.  He told me to f*ck off.  Now keep in mind I was always polite in what I was saying to him.  No customers should be treated this way.  I don't care if you don't care about the dog in the car, this review is based on how rude the guy is and how he should be told off and hopefully never comes back to work again.I've always thought that the 'Come Back In' should  be called the 'Come Back Inn'...it was a missed pun opportunity in my opinion.Anyway, I've been to the Come Back In approximately 20 times in the four or so years since I discovered it. Lots of times, I came to drink. It's a fun bar, especially when you're looking to go out in an "off" time, like a Sunday night. The place usually always has people inside, which lends a fun vibe!The food at the Come Back In is solid. I've had a few things that I haven't loved, and it's not fancy, different, or creative. However, most of the food that I've tried has been in the 3 or 4 star range...especially their breakfast! If you go for breakfast/brunch, try the Crabcakes and Asparagus Eggs Benedict. It's so rich, that I've never been able to finish them, despite their high taste coefficient. The Huevos Rancheros are really just a breakfast burrito, but they're also fab. The prices are really affordable at the Come Back In, and I think the quality of the food that you get is much better than you would expect. It's a good value, and I don't think that's true for every restaurant. Take their late night special of $3 for a burger and fries. It's a small burger, yes, but you can choose from a variety of toppings for the burger, and several different kinds of fries (Parmesan, cajun, regular). It's a fantastic deal, and nothing tastes quite as good as a burger when drunk, IMO. Even if you're not drinking, it's a good deal for a late dinner, and I think the special starts at 10:00pm. Cheaper than McDonald's, and far better. Unlike some other nearby restaurants (ahem...I'm looking at you, Great Dane), the Come Back In is a great place to go with a group. They are accommodating, respectful, more than willing to split checks, and big enough that usually there is little to no wait. Real life story: One Sunday last summer we had a group of ~10 people for brunch and El Dorado Grill next door wanted us to wait for an hour. After an hour had passed, El Dorado wanted us to wait for 30 minutes more. Instead, we walked down the road to the Come Back In and were seated immediately. We sat outside and had cheap and delicious Bloody Mary's, Mimosas, and excellent food.Perhaps my favorite thing about the Come Back Inn though, is the service. Now, the service itself isn't necessarily perfect. Sometimes the waiters can be a little rough around the edges...most are college kids, after all. They might forget to bring your drink until you remind them, or they might not know the answer to a question you have about the menu.  However the *attitude* of the majority of the staff at the Come Back In is what makes it different. Even though they screw up occasionally, they always try to make it better. One time we stopped in right before they stopped serving dinner, which was kind of a dick move on our part, but they sat us and said, "no problem! we can totally still serve you" and were cheerful and great about the whole thing. Another time, I went for dinner/drinks with a big group and the food was taking awhile to come out. The waiter arrived with several baskets of complimentary popcorn and peanuts without being asked, because he anticipated we might be getting hungry. It's refreshing not to have waiters who roll their eyes when you ask for a refill of your drink or an additional side or condiment for your meal. It happens to me in Madison more often than you'd expect, but this sort of thing has never happened to me at the Come Back In. The Come Back In is not fancy, and it's not perfect, but I really like it, and I'd pick it over many other "nicer" and more popular restaurants on the near East side any day!
The Range Steakhouse=Well, I would call this a 5 star restaurant, but I can only give it 4 stars, read on to see why...I came here with my lovely girlfriend, 2 customers and their wives. We made a reservation early and got a great table over looking the strip, right next to the windows. We had drinks (average 10$/drink) and started with the Sea Tower appetizer, which had muscles, shrimps, lobster tail and crab legs (56$).  My customers had surf and turf (46$), fish of the day (42$), lobster bisque (8$), filet mignon (42$) and NY Strip (45$). I had jumbo fried shrimp (36$) and my girlfriend had the blacked salmon (36$). A few house salads also (8$ each)... Finally, for desert, I found out it was one of my customers 24th wedding anniversary, so I had them make a special desert and write on the plate, it was very lovely (complimentary). The reason I can only give 4 stars is service. I ordered a rum and coke before we ordered the appetizer, and didn't get it till the salads came out, about 20 minutes later. Also, it took our waiter about 10 minutes to figure out who the desert was for, even though my girlfriend not only told him, but the manager to be sure. Finally, after the meal was over,  I showed the waiter my credit card under the table and got his attention, in an effort to say "Hey, I am buying". He proceeded to take the bill over to the wrong couple, showing them the 515$ tab, NOT GOOD! The dinner was on me, from my customer, and yes maybe I am 25 and they were about 45 years old average, but you DO NOT put the bill in plain view showing the total if you don't know who it goes to. I was very insulted...Needless to say, the tab, with tip, came to almost 600$, and that was definitively the most expensive meal I had ever paid for...Either way, The food was all delicious (the lobster was a bit overcooked and the muscles were on the salty side), the service was generally good (minus a few mistakes), and all the flavors were delicious. I would bring customers back here, but I would make damn sure they knew who the bill was to come to.
Common Plea Restaurant=so hubby and i have never been so inspired to start up a yelp account until this very day, right after coming home from lunch at the common plea. oh and note that there is supposedly a "business casual" dress code.we were very excited to try out common plea. we had a $30 gift certificate to spend there, and we figured lunch would be a good time to try out the food fare. and if it was any good, we might go back for dinner some time. when we arrived at 12pm, it didn't look too busy, but it filled up more by the time we'd finished lunch. however, even though it wasn't terribly busy, we were led to the back of the restaurant to be seated on the back "wall" we shared with their kitchen staff. we didn't mind the noise until our fake wall started shaking from time to time. they offer bread rolls and a flatbread cracker and seasoned olive oil dip while you wait for your food. the sweet wheat roll was soft and delicious, as was the large cracker. however the other two sourdough-looking rolls were hard as rocks, thus rendering them inedible. i don't know how they taste because the crust was simply too hard to bite through.  hubby ordered the espresso crusted salmon with honey basil yogurt and mushroom rice, while i had the piattini - a set of 3 appetizers, and i picked the prosciutto wrapped shrimp, short rib sliders, and crab boursin cornet (a cone-shaped pastry stuffed with crab mixed in with boursin cheese). the espresso crusted salmon was pretty good and standard for salmon. however the espresso crust was very light. it was barely noticeable, unless you ate pieces of the salmon directly on top. it flaked well, but wasn't as tender or moist as salmon we've had elsewhere. or even the chimichurri salmon we get from trader joe's and bake at home. the rice lacked flavoring and was a bit hard when chewing through it. i expected more of a risotto-like consistency. at least it looked the part. they are quite good at plating their food. in terms of my set of 3 appetizers, i definitely enjoyed the prosciutto wrapped shrimp. basically it's lean italian bacon wrapped around large prawns. i got 2 of them along with about 2 teaspoons of a mango/red bell pepper/red onion/cilantro salsa. the salsa was good, but as long as you use fresh ingredients, it's pretty hard to screw up. my crab boursin cornet i was very excited about when i saw it on my plate. it was a little (2.5 in. long) pastry horn/cone stuffed with a ball of mixed crab with boursin cheese. the flavor was good, however i was disappointed when i discovered my pastry crust was soggy and cold. usually pastry crusts are supposed to be flaky, crispy, and hot in my experience. when i mentioned this to the waiter, and asked "is my pastry crust supposed to be soggy and cold?" he said "yes, that is how it's supposed to be". so sad. it could have been sooo much better. there was potential there. i'll give them that. then my short rib slider. was small as expected. a toasted bun with carmelized onions, mushrooms, and "short ribs". i took one bite and had to put what was in my mouth back on the plate. it was incredibly chewy, in a bad way. upon opening up my slider and examining my "short ribs", i discovered i was chewing on a piece of fat. when i attempted to dissect apart the paltry bit of meat from the fat, that proved to be impossible with a fork and knife because the actual meat on that thing was too tough to either bite or cut through sadly. hubby's attempt at my slider wasn't any better. he said it was 90% fat. and he had to agree what miniscule pieces of meat in there were extremely tough to chew on and bland. we thought about giving them one last chance with dessert. so we picked the creme brulee option. we've actually made our own creme brulee quite a bit... it's a real favorite treat for us! the crust seemed freshly torched, it was crisp and wasn't too burnt. however upon cracking the crust, hubby noticed lumps inside the creme brulee. and texture-wise, it tasted like really thick whipping cream with lumps of course, it's usually a bit more pudding-like and smoother.  it came with an almond-covered cookie thing. i was confused when i bit into it, because it tasted like a stale cookie. then hubby pointed out that it was a thin slice of white bread, with almonds and stuff baked on top. not too appetizing. it would have been so much better if they attempted almond tuilles.sadly, our meal did not go as well as planned. the presentation of the food is pleasant and appealing to the eye.  taste was just alright for hubby and 1 out of 3 appetizers for me. oh and they don't refill water for you at all throughout the meal. and be prepared to wait at least half an hour for your food and the same time for your dessert to come out even if it doesn't look busy. not planning to come back to this one any time soon.OH AND BTW...

Panda Express=There are some places that I order the same thing 99% of the time...and this is one of them.  I always get the 3 item combo with:Fried Rice/Chow MeinOrange ChickenSweet & Sour ChickenBeef & BroccoliThis location is solid....fresh ingredients and quick service.Will I return?  When I need a quick Chinese fix...sure.This Panda Express is located inside Vons near the produce department. I like that I can grab something to eat while getting a few items at the store. It just is convenient without having to then make another stop for food. I have to say the employees here are awesome. Well, the manager this last time was having lunch and talking with someone (maybe having a meeting?) while this girl was hustling to take care of the orders. I questioned how long something has been sitting out and she offered to make it fresh if I didn't mind waiting. Of course not! I can't believe how this girl was working so hard to take care of the customers and offering to make me fresh food while the manager laughed away in her conversation only a couple feet from me. She should have excused herself and pitched in for a moment. I took the time to tell the girl helping me that she was a hard worker and that I appreciated her service. I only wish I caught her name to give her a shout-out in this review. I like to get the 2 or 3 item combo. I always choose fried rice because I find their chow mein to have too many veggies vs. noodles and the noodles are kind of dry. The Firecracker Chicken had good flavor. It isn't very spicy but has a nice baby kick. I tried Beijing Beef and it was sweet and spicy and my favorite of all I ate.  For my 3rd item I got Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was sweet, crispy, and good. The Cream Cheese Rangoons are a nice snack on the way home and aren't greasy. If you don't want your food to go, they have tables.I don't even know how to start this review...  I ordered panda express through a delivery service called postmates. This is what showed up on my doorstep. Fried rice : So over cooked the rice was not able to be chewed because it was so hard.  The eggs in the fried rice were completely black.Spring Rolls: still frozen inside. I called panda express and the lady who answered the phone didn't speak English. I should have known never to eat panda express in the first place, but this was ridiculous.Timing is what it's all about people!!  The wife and I rarely get to eat out together and decided to go to Canton Dragon via 75th ave. The entire street, from Thomas to Indian School Rd. was closed due to a head on collision that killed 2 people we found out later. Turned around and went to Panda Express armed with 2 coupons for 2 extra free entrees. We were starving by 8pm so we opted to dine in. We got lucky and hit a lull and were able to order immediately. We ordered a little of everything from chow mein and honey shrimp ($1.25 extra) to beef and broccoli to walnut chicken. We didn't expect much flavor wise and being hungry we didn't care! The a/c thermostat must have been set on 68 degrees and after waiting to pay, finding a clean table and dodging numerous unsupervised children our food was cold. Total price for this experience was just this side of $20.00 even with coupons and no drink order. This dining experience is true testament that timing is everything! Could have been much worse! Just glad to be safely home with no suspicious abdominal gurgling!
Persian Garden Cafe=I'm actually a pretty big fan of PGC. I was first treated to Mahmoud's culinary talent way back in the day (late 90's), when he owned the Green Leaf Cafe up on 19th Ave (where Fattoush is today). His current location is much nicer, but the food is still center stage. One critique that I've heard over the years is that people were expecting something different due to the name. PGC is not a Persian restaurant. It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine.The menu is quite large, with slight variances between lunch and dinner (dinner has more seafood and meat options - but honestly they let me order anything at anytime). There are always daily specials which are generally based on whatever Mahmoud finds at the daily market and items are clearly marked as Vegetarian, Vegan, or Carnivorous.My biggest challenge at PGC is narrowing down the choices to a reasonable amount of food (which isn't easy because the portions can be quite large).Some things that shine as stars on the menu:* the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan* barley soup (when it is one of the daily soups) - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley* angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx, then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient*purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant, topped with sautéed onions, garlic, scallion, tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon juice and feta cheese*herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one, but it truly rocks!Most of the meals are served with brown and white basmati rice topped with a toasted almond-raisin-saffron mix, a homemade cugurt sauce and fresh nan. I could probably make a meal on this stuff alone.PGC has a small selection of wines, but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them. The peach tea is like none other that I have ever tried!The only thing that I'm not a big fan of are the deserts - with the exception of the ginger and rose petal ice cream. If I'm going to splurge calories on desert, it's not going to be on a Vegan Cheesecake. But that ice cream... my mom and I split one and the first bite I took was weird and wonderful all at the same time - by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl we were having a spoon fight that required black-belt finger moves.This is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles. It's not cheap, but they definitely make up for it in quality and large portions. Call ahead to check the schedule if you are interested in going on a night when they have belly dancing (usually the only time you need a reservation).I have been driving by this place for over 5+ years and never bothered to try it; Except yesterday. I came to find out that I would have went on with my life by never going there and not missing much.I came here for lunch with my co-workers so they could try Persian food. When we arrived, it was pretty dead. We were seated and handed the menus...as I was looking, I was expecting Cholo Kabab, Ghormeh Sabzi, Gheimeh, etc...instead I found TOFU, GRILLED CHEESE, and everything else that was not Iranian!  I am pretty certain tofu doesnt even exist in Iran. They did have doogh (Iranian yogurt drink), so that was good. I was so disappointed. We got the hummus and it was lacking flavor and was super runny. The bread, which the waitress called NAAN (it's called noon) but it wasn't naan or noon or pita bread..I don't know what it was. I do know it wasn't good. One of my coworkers go the chicken kabob plate, I got the shish kabob plate with half rice and half shirazi salad, and my other co worker got the BZ (or DZ) stew. My kabobs were chewy, my salad was overly sour and had too much dried mint, and the rice tasted old. My coworker didn't really like his stew either. The service was extreeeeeemely slow. One of the girls brought the wrong food to our table...mind you, there was only 2 tables. And the prices are pretty up there for bad food. I won't be going back.
Dish=Allow me to go ahead and dish on Dish. Dish is indeed A-OK in my book. With kitschy decor, down home grub and solid service, Dish is a solid choice for an affordable and tasty fare in Plaza Midwood. Hubs and I rolled into Dish after three failed attempts at other local restaurants on a Saturday evening. I was not in the mindset to wait an HOUR for a table, so Dish is where we landed!We grabbed an affordable drink at the bar and waited about 10 minutes for our table - that's a score at 8 pm on a Saturday night. The menu is filled with a variety of options ranging from Fried Green Tomatoes, to Pot Roast, to Shrimp and Grits. While it's definitely not a low cal location, Dish has a variety of dishes that will please just about any palate. Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions for both appetizer and main course. We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes. Overall, not a bad dish. Small fried greenies with a tangy dill dipping sauce. I was hoping for more flavor in the breading - from what I could tell it was just flour and egg...no pepper, no additional spices, etc. About 15 minutes later I dug into my Chicken & Dumplings - a moderate and well priced portion of the milky soup stuffed with long bits of shredded chicken and hearty dumplings. It was well made and hearty - but again, it was lacking flavor. Boatloads of pepper were added. For my side, I chose the sweet potato mash which was indeed sweet - almost too sweet for my liking! And that's saying quite a bit. The gratis honey biscuit and deviled egg really were stars of the meal, though! The biscuit came out warm with a honey glaze...I promptly devoured my biscuit in 30 seconds flat. YUM. The deviled egg was super fresh and perfectly crafted. So, while Dish wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had it was comforting, solid and very affordable. If I find myself in a pinch next time I'm in PM, Dish is on my short list.** Pimento Cheese on Pita Bread Points Appetizer. 5/5.Requested Cold. Housemade with diced pimento and pickled jalapenos. SUPERB! The best thing that I ate all night. They should market this stuff. It is what "I" would make IF "I" went to the effort of grinding sharp cheddar cheese through a meat grinder. Their pimento cheese was so good when we had our company Christmas lunch at Dish, that we almost fought over the stuff. It was equally as good tonight. Good Job! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=zC0ICeQYyG--Ls2EXaWjCwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=l6RMXmTzpIS9pZSj15ZVAQ** Pot Roast: 3/5.Okay, tasty, a little fatty. I was expecting a larger portion for $13.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=Orr6SwW8k09q8D2UehE2Fw** Mashed Potatoes w/Gravy. 3.5/5.They left the skin on, which I like. This paired well the meat, but I would like to be able to choose my own sides, thank you. ** Collard Greens. 4/5.Good, sweet, rustic. Well done. The pot likker was delicious, but I didn't stumble across any pieces of ham hocks. (Can one be a collard green snob? Maybe, I am. LOL)** Biscuit. 3/5. Who puts honey on the "outside" of a biscuit? It just makes the darned thing sticky and messy. Everyone knows, well not the people at Dish - but everyone else, knows that butter and honey go on the INSIDE of a biscuit. You're welcome.** Deviled Egg. 1/5.A pitiful example of one of my favorite egg dishes. Cold and lacking in any taste whatsoever. No love or attention was put into this food item. Lowe's Supermarket has MUCH better deviled eggs in their deli. My mother made better deviled eggs.....and so do I, there's no comparison. ** Bloody Mary. 3/5.Tasty and spicy, but the glass was about 80% ice to monetize the drink. Those Bastids. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=UAq8RfqQUtrvA_1AH-KPRA** Service? 1/5. (see below)The maitre'd gave me lip about wanting to sit at a booth, in a basically empty (5 p.m.) restaurant - not a good start. If I'm paying $30+ dollars for a meal, I sit where I like, thank you. I had a passive/aggressive waitress that I damn near wanted to strangle by evening's end. She didn't tell me the specials, because she probably didn't know what they were. Another blue haired hipster waitress at an adjacent table didn't know what they were either, when a foursome of diners asked - and THAT waitress was far better than the one that I endured. My waitress actually gave me grief about not ordering dessert, when I had already had an appetizer, a mixed drink, and an entree. She gave me grief about bringing a to go box for the remains of my pimento cheese app. What REALLY ticked me off was when I was ready to leave. Said waitress took my credit card......and then she didn't return for what seemed an eternity. When I looked around, she was taking other people's orders, wrapping silverware, busing tables, delivering to go boxes, etc., with no apparent hurry to bring back my ticket to sign....so I could get the heck out of Dodge. She seemed to be trying to do everything at once, which resulted in her doing everything haphazardly. After a good fifteen to twenty minutes of waiting, I was ready to YELL from frustration. No, seriously, I almost lost it. A nice meal was basically ruined by a disorganized waitress. In summary: The food is good. Some food items are priced a little too high. The pot roast was $13, which was effing ridiculous considering the portion was not "that" large. (I think that they charged me for the entire cut of roast.) The service pretty much sucks. The acoustics are terribly LOUD when the restaurant if full. All of the waitstaff are wannabe hipsters. Parking is difficult. I have no intention of going back again anytime soon, unless someone else wants to go there. I should have went to Baoding or Bistro La Bon or Midwood Smokehouse or Good Food on Montford. {sigh} Maybe, next time.
The Penguin Drive-In=I'm a fan of superheroes: comics, movies, you name it. Typically, you'lll find me in a big debate on superhero powers: invisibility vs. flying. Tonight, I longed for bionic arteries that could withstand daily dosages of Penguin's delectable greasy food. Penguins is an "establishment." Landmark restaurant, arguably in a historic location, complete with the tiniest, antiquated porcelain drinking fountain , fit only for pygmies, out front. It feels more like a bar than a restaurant inside. Lots of wood on the walls and bar, a jukebox blaring David Bowie, Foo Fighters and some hairbands. The burgers are straightforward and delicious. Soft, moist bun, lettuce, tomato and a hand-shaped burger patty, that tastes like the heralded In-N-Out burger on crack. The Ribeye Sandwich is surprisingly delicious. Horseradish mayo compliments the tender beef, a messy mass of perfection. The stars of the show are their generously portioned, translucent tissue paper inducing, greasy sides. We ordered sweet potato fries and thin onion strings. The sweet potato fries, when dipped into honey mustard sauce are addictive. Although not super crisp or battered, the sweet potato flavor rings through. The onion strings were lightly battered, sweet and tasty. They are the kind that are just oniony enough to satisfy, but not too oniony where you'd run for some mouthwash right after.  I seriously could imagine me pounding both down after a night of drinking. Speaking of which, beers: $2 domestics, $3.50 imports. Not bad. Rarely will I take leftover fried food to go, but I took a box home tonight. Hoping somehow the oven will revive the amazing cravability factor of my onion rings and sweet potato fries. 3 beers, 2 entrees, 2 sides (lots leftover) $24.The wait was over an hour, and the staff was rude! The food was bland, everything needed salt. The fries were cold, and the burgers were small. I went with a family of 5 and tried a bit of everyone's food and was not impressed. I asked for the waiter to put my grilled cheese on texas toast rather than the pita, and he said no. BUT both grilled cheese and texas toast is on the menu! Rude. Do NOT go here. It is not worth it. There are only 10 tables, this place is not good for large groups of people OR children. It is loud and the kids will not enjoy the environment.In P/M this diner was born and raisedThe Penguin was where we spent most of our daysThe Burgers, Pickles, Dogs all coolAll drinkin' some pitchers up on a barstoolWhen a family of peepsWho were up to no goodStarted makin' trouble in our neighborhoodThey got greedy for cash and in a scandalous moveStole the place from the owners, don't no one approve.We pulled up to the place - it's in such a weird stateAll emptied and closed, gettin' coats of new paintWe looked to the sign, It was still up thereYet another sad victim of corporate warfare.I don't plan to go back to the schmucky new Penguin. My business will follow the delightful original owners to their new location, the Diamond.so apparently this isn't the one it was anymore.  sad.  The place I went to has now since closed, and is now run by other people and the food is so different now. BOO!Also - don't fake like you were the ones on Triple D.  That's just sad.Since my previous review about the new corporate version of this once loved establishment was flagged and removed i'll try again. It was removed  "because it does not contain a new firsthand experience with the business." Now why they think it wasn't based off of an experience is beyond me. (mind readers maybe??) Anyways, this is not the "Original Penguin" that gained all the acclaim. Notice the "TM" after the name now. It is a lame, shell of a version of the restaurant that once lived. Wait staff was inattentive, food was greasy, I don't expect it to last long. If you are looking for food inspired by the original Penguin, try Pinkys Westside, or The Diamond. Corporate entity's have no business swallowing up a local legend, and demanding the same respect of the community, please support local business.I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted a one hour trip! I didn't know this place had new ownership, as soon as we looked at the menu we knew something wasn't right cause it was all different but the worse thing is they don't carry the Best Ever Banana Pudding! Their onion rings for an appetizer was the size of a side order & it was just onion rings with no "onion"! We sat at the bar & kept seeing waitresses bring food back cause it was cold. Like a lot of places the prices went up & less food!  I will never waste my time coming here again!I love how the new ownership is trying to flag bad reviews for removal. What's the point of a review site if people can't share their honest opinion?The Penguin is NOT what it used to be. It completely lacks the original atmosphere, and the food quality has slipped as well. This place used to serve the best burger in Charlotte and we would take friends there just for the burgers- but the one I had on my first (and last!) visit since it reopened was a complete let-down: dry and overcooked. We ordered fries to split, but the portion was smaller than before and came out cold. Worse yet, no hush puppies! I'm one of those people that identifies an establishment by the one thing they do best, be it breakfast, pasta, chicken, whatever- thinking about the Penguin always made me hungry for a Block Burger with hush puppies. We will not be going back. Time to find a new "best burger." :(I'll admit at the outset that I was a regular fan of the Penguin's previous incarnation.  For the long and short of it - the new one feels like Applebees does the Penguin.  The food is still generally good, but the menu is much more limited in scope.  Gone are the interesting sandwiches like the grilled peanut butter and banana or the tuna melt.  There are still burgers and dogs, and they remain good.  There are still a significant number of veggie options, including versions of the dog and burger.  There are salads for those seeking healthy food at the Penguin.My partner got a veggie dog with pimiento cheese and fried pickles on top.  He liked it quite a bit.  I got a small burger and dog--both southern style (chili, slaw, mustard, 86 the onions) and both good.  I also got fries, and they were crisp and hot.What has changed is that it no longer feels a part of the neighborhood.  The waitresses are all perky and friendly, but there isn't a tattoo to be found anywhere.  The music throughout our visit was soft hits of the 80s.  There are lots of t-shirts and merchandise that tout the long history of the Penguin, but also feel alien to it.  They look more like they would be sold on the boardwalk in Carolina Beach.  I don't know whether there will eventually be more of a sense of community in the new Penguin.  Perhaps with time the staff will get to know regulars and it will feel more authentic.  Until then, the food is OK, and it is clean and safe.  It is also MUCH easier to get a table now, but you can take that to mean what you like.I was in Charlotte yesterday and was awfully excited at the prospect of stopping by my old fav, "The Penguin" for lunch. This was the coolest, most iconic restaurant/diner in Charlotte--the place where I would tell people visiting from out-of-town that they "had to visit!" Now, not so much.The atmosphere was gone, the people (regular patrons/employees) were gone; the fried pickles were so-so, the cheese fries were not the legendary ones I remember, the hushpuppies were gone, and the black-bean veggie burger was some dried out piece-o-crap vs. the delicious runny mess that I longed for. What the hell happened? I came home and did some research on the Internet and apparently the former owners got the boot last October and the current owners are trying to franchise this once legendary establishment. Shame on you for turning the best diner experience EVER into some "Applebee-esque" nightmare.Folks, this isn't the same restaurant you've seen on Food Network and Travel Channel. In a nutshell, The Penguin was opened in 1954 by a man I'll call "Mr B". Around 10 years ago, two guys - Brian and Jimmy - took over the restaurant from Mr B, who has since died. Brian and Jimmy hired Greg to be head chef, and the "new" Penguin was a smash hit. However, when Brian and Jimmy's lease was up for renewal, Mr B's family decided to kick them out and hire Martin Sprock to turn it into a franchise.But how's the food? Sadly, a shadow of its former self. The fried pickles, once the star of the show, are greasy and soggy, and not nearly as good as before. I ordered the "Freak Flag Fly", a burger with queso, bacon and slaw, and was bitterly disappointed. The meat was dry and overdone, and flavor was... lacking. My fries were way too cool (almost cold) and lacked salt. My GF's onion rings were entirely too "bready", not like the delicious ones I remember from before. For the record, the new menu is actually larger than the previous menu. But one wonders why they should have a bigger menu if they can't even get basics like fries and rings right. And I also wonder why it took so long to get our food when there were only three other occupied tables at 7PM on a Thursday night.What's worse is that the ambiance is totally gone. It's still the same building, but the servers lack tattoos. The jukebox, once one of the most eclectic in Charlotte, is now Top 40. They even sell souvenirs now! It's like a Disney-fied version of the restaurant I once knew and loved! If you want to have the same food that made the Penguin such a success in the first place, try The Diamond next door (Brian and Jimmy's new place) or Pinky's Westside (Greg's new place). Both are delicious and authentic. The "new" Penguin is neither.I could just put a sad face here, and leave it at that, but then you wouldn't know the excruciating time we had at this place. Wow. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and I don't give one star reviews lightly!! After hearing how great this place was over and over and over, and that it was on Diners, drive Ins and dives I HAD to go. I'm a sucker for that sorta thing, and man did this place miss the mark. I can honestly say unless they make some serious changes I may never go back or give it a second glance. Parking was an adventure at this place.. the only spots open were close to a curb, so I decided to take my SUV and pretend it was a Jeep Wrangler. I got so frustrated trying to find a place to park on an empty stomach that I seriously just baja'd over the curb and bounced into the small spot that was waiting. When we came in, I was excited about this place. It had that old divey dinerish feel that I love and I figured there was NO way this place could be a miss. We got the menu and I thought everything sounded amazing! I ended up opting to make my own burger. Egg, mozzarella cheese & mayo. Pretty simple right? Well not for our server, she was apparently still drunk from her binge the night before. I know this because she told us, in her half arsed attempt of an apology. Sigh. I'll get there, don't you worry. I got my burger with fries. I'd asked for onion rings.... That wasn't that big of a deal, but it was only the beginning to the train wreck that was coming. The burger looked fantastic, and I couldn't wait to try it! Well I took that first bite and there was a taste I wasn't expecting... ONIONS. Really? So you forget the onion rings but you apparently added them to my burger, and went sans mayo. Good thing I like onions I guess. I just ate the burger and didn't say anything at first. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ sandwich with the sauce on the side and no coleslaw. She brings him the BBQ with no sauce, and coleslaw slathered on the top of it. He has to remind her that he asked for no coleslaw and the sauce on the side. She brings him two types of sauce to try and the sweeter of the two is a mustard based. How do I know this? Because she mixed the mustard in and a fat layer of yellow was on top the the smokey red. She didn't even mix it up or anything. Normally I'm not this picky of a person, but with every single thing that happened, I had enough. We asked her for a box twice, and took home the leftovers. She did apologize about her screw ups, and said, "I'm so sorry, I think I'm still half drunk. I'll give you a free dessert." I almost didn't get the dessert because by this point I had better things to do than spend any more of my time at the penguin. But she said banana pudding and I thought maybe that would bring them back up a star. She brought it over, I took a few bites and I just wasn't impressed. When we got home my stomach was all torn up, and I ended up throwing away the left overs. I didn't want to feel that way two days in a row. UGH. Sorry for the long winded review, but I warned you. My take on this place: :( Save your money, and keep the experience of what you saw on TV in your heart. This place is sure to disappoint.
Florida Cafe Cuban Bar & Grill=I had a Groupon for the Florida Cafe that was going to expire in a few days so I went here last night to use it and I'm glad I did.  My server was a delightful young woman but we had a bit of a language problem as you'll see during my review.I looked over the menu and I also asked her suggestion.  She pointed to an oxtail stew that's not on their online menu.  I opted to take her advice.  I started with their papas rellenas--mashed potatoes stuffed with picadillo beef and deep fried.  Presentation was very nice with two very thin plantain pieces deep freid and stuck in the papas.  There was also a small salad.The menu said all dinners come with red or black beans and rice.  I specified black beans.  That was the first language mixup.  Not only did I get black beans with my meal but my server brought me an extra bowl of black beans because she thought I ordered an extra dish.  It was good so I ate both!The oxtail stew was very flavorful.  I think some people might have thought the broth was salty, but it was just great for me.Dessert order time.  I asked about the size of the tres leches cake tower with flan and coconut.  She assured me it wasn't that large and then she brought me the normal flan and not the tres leches cake.  Language problem number 2.She asked if I wanted more Coke and I said, "No, iced tea."  She then brought me a Coke.  I didn't notice, but I soon had a table side science experiment.  You have no idea how Coke foams when you put artificial sweetener in it.  I managed to keep little Vesuvius from flooding the table, but I didn't drink the Coke.  Last language error.I'm going to go back because I really like Cuban food.  I'll also make sure that what I want is a bit more explicit!I've been here years ago, but for some reason haven't been back. A few friends suggested coming here as they haven't been in a long time as well and a few in our party never been. We shared appetizers of - Jamon Croquettas - so think of if ham were fish sticks, then that would be this. Interesting, but I wouldn't get it again. Chicarones - these were served warm and were nicely crunchy. Solid chicaron. And they serve you white bread rolls slathered in butter. The BF and I shared - Cuban Sandwich with fries - This was a decent sandwich, but not the best I've had. Get it with the plaintain chips if you're into them as someone in our party got those and I thought that was better as the fries are standard. Pernil de Cerdo Asado - the pork was pretty tender and the red beans were pretty good. I feel it was missing something like a sauce though. I order something similar in LA and it's in a mojo sauce and I could have sworn eons ago when I was here last my meat was more citrusy. Service was just OK. Sometimes it seemed like they didn't really care and seemed to mishear us a lot. "Okay, french fries" "No, chicarones." "Oh okay". "Chuletas de Cerdo" "No, Pernil de Cerdo" "Oh'. Someone got black beans instead of what they actually ordered. It's a unique place with some charm. I feel it was slightly better years ago when we used to go. I remember really loving the pork back then, but I didn't feel the love as much now. I would probably eat here again when there is a hankering, but it sits right in the middle of the road for me.
Piper's Pub=They've really got their shiz together!  I can't complain about a single thing!  The service was A+.  Completely attentive and extremely friendly.  Food was excellent!  I hadn't been to Pipers in a while so I felt like I needed another visit to properly review the place.  I got super excited about going there when I tried their Guinness Stew at an event last week so I was set on ordering that because it was so delicious, even in a buffet style!  But then at the last minute changed my mind, being tempted by the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie.  It was so savory!  The Scottish Ale gravy was so thick and tasty and those crispy potatoes on top?  It was like icing on top of a delicious cake!  I am NOT one to forget about the sweet things in life, but this was such a hearty meal that there was no way I could have eaten dessert after such a hearty meal.  Now I can't wait to go back and sample some more delicious meals and have a nice English ale to boot!I can see why 50 other folks love this place! Quite the find. Wholesome, hearty, beefy, Brit-inspired fare. This is rib-stickin' food, my friends. Fries on salads, scotch eggs, proper English AND Irish brekkies served anytime, Guinness stew, shepherd's and their pies, chicken & mushroom pastry...and, a VEGAN BLACK BURGER. Yes, the geniuses behind Piper's Pub though of just about everyone, even the vegans. Well done, well done. Also, a whole mess of sandwiches, etc. Yes, the food is excellent enough to stand on its own, but what truly makes this place shine is the service. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly, equipped with a wifi password (he saw me checking my phone, checking in of course!) without even asking, plus a story to boot (ask the owner about "Yo Pipes!"). Waters and hot teas arrived swiftly as did menus. Our lunching partners joined us, we all ordered and from start to finish the service was utterly flawless. We had no less than 3 gentlemen taking orders, delivering food, refilling waters, checking on our happiness, etc. All just seemed to totally have their shit together and like being alive. This is rarity in the biz, these guys got it. This place has roots, and one of them seems to be treating guests like proper guestsAnd making them wish they'd worn stretchy pants. On a last second whim, I went with the full English Breakfast. Baked beans, bangers (sausages), 2 eggs over easy and thick cut toast all heaped onto a plate. It arrived in all of its glory, HOT, delicious and exactly what I wanted. It kept me full for approximately 9 hours (the entire drive to NYC) and I consumed about 1/4 of it. This stuff is for REAL. I'd say you might want to think about sharing plates due to the huge portions, but the food is so darned good I just recommend ordering your own and taking home leftovers. It's worth it. The lunch hour was a comfortable busy and I left with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Yes, I was full...but really, Piper's is the bomb. Yo Pipes! Indeed. HUGE lunch for 4, no booze + tip: $60.Have you ever read the book (or seen the film) "Alive"? You know, where the rugby team crashes in the Andes, and while freezing to death, they are forced to eat their dead in order to survive?Well, I think that rugby team should probably have just brought along Piper's Pub's Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie. Because it is the absolute perfect winter meal, and then they could've avoided that whole cannibalism thing. For only about $10 at Piper's, you'll get a huge, hearty serving of the most rich, flavorful, lamb stew you've ever had, topped with crispy potatoes, and filled with even more. This one delicious, piping-hot bowl will sustain you for days. If you eat the whole thing, I promise you won't even have any room left for the guy who was sitting in 7C.This place is always packed on a Friday or Saturday night (I've been given 2+ hour wait times on multiple occasions), but it's not very hard to see why.  The business which makes it difficult for a group is caused by the things that make it so attractive to a group.First, it's simply a nice place to hang out.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable (if a bit slow sometimes); the decor is nice and on-theme; and the crowd is a far cry more mature and diverse than what comes to mind when you mention "South Side Bar" to your average Pittsburgher.Second, the food isn't just your usual bar food.  That fare is available, but they also have a lot of options from across the pond--Scottish and British specialties, many with a North American accent.  Not every item on their extensive menu is a winner, but once you figure out what you like, you'll get far more hits than misses.Third, if you're a fan of single malt Scotch whiskies, this is easily one of the best bars in the county to explore the category.  The entire whisky list is great, but the offerings from Scotland are without equal (at least among all the bars I've been to or heard about in and near Pittsburgh--the selection is also bigger than that of any single liquor store I've been to in the state).So check out Piper's, but please, not all at once and preferably not when I'm going there.  It's too crowded already.  Don't make me regret this review.Piper's has been on my to-visit list forever, and I finally received the chance to check it out this past Sat. for dinner at 6:30pm.  I came for a double date with CM and some friends of mine who've been to Scotland, so I was very interested in their thoughts on the authenticity of the offerings.  Given the great things I'd heard about Piper's, it didn't disappoint--a good time was had by all, and all of us left well satiated!For our appetizer, CM and I ordered the Ploughman's platter, which consisted of an apple-cherry chutney, two types of cheese, apple slices, gherkin pickles, and baguettes ($13).  This platter contained more than enough food for all four of us to share, and was a nice accompaniment to our entrees and drinks.  I say entrees because, due to an oversight on my part, we ordered the platter slightly after our entrees, so it came out at the same time as everything else, rather than beforehand.  I can't fault the waitstaff or kitchen for this, however, since the ordering error was mine!  Our friends ordered a whisky flight of the single malt basics ($12), which they enjoyed sampling, even if they didn't enjoy every whisky comprising it.  (One of them commented that the smokiest whisky, the Laphroaig, tasted like drinking a campfire!)  Interestingly, they mentioned that the lighter whiskys tasted different after having sampled the smokier ones, adding interest to the sampling.For our entrees, we all ordered from the "across the pond" section of the menu.  Three of us ordered variations on the shepherd's pie (chicken shepherd's pie, $12; chicken mushroom cottage pie, $12; lamb and smoked chestnut, $12), and the other one ordered the bangers and mash ($12).  All of us enjoyed our entrees very much.  Because we didn't share entrees, I can only describe my own--the chicken shepherd's pie--firsthand.  Despite a somewhat visually unappealing presentation, the flavors were savory, comforting, and filling--exactly what I'd hoped for in a shepherd's pie.  According to our waitress, the filling of the cottage pie was exactly the same as mine; the only thing that differed was the topping (potatoes for the shepherd's pie vs. puff pastry for the cottage pie).  If I ordered this item again, I think I'd go with the puff pastry due to the greater visual appeal and added textural interest.  One minor criticism was that we felt that less meat than we expected was included.  As for CM, he enjoyed the bangers and mash, commenting that both the sausages and potatoes were delicious and filling--though I found the presentation of this dish a bit strange.In line with my expectations, service from our waitress was responsive when needed, but unobtrusive when unnecessary.  The ambiance was appropriate for a UK pub, though I found the table configuration a bit awkward.  (We were seated at the high top closest to the host stand, which wouldn't have been my first choice, but it was busy, and that's what opened up when we came up on the list.)  Also, it was a bit on the loud side--though we didn't have any trouble hearing one another at the table.  The wait was about 20 min.--not too bad, considering we came during prime dinner hour on a Sat.  Then again, this is a pub, so I imagine it becomes increasingly crowded as the night wears on.Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience at Pipers's Pub, and would definitely be willing to return in the future.  CM's and my total check came to $27 with a $10 City Dining card discount, and we felt the prices were fair for the quality and amount of food received.  If you need a break from the normal Carson St. bar scene and would like to experience a UK-style pub with quality eats, check Piper's out!
Saigon Palace=Lately, we've been doing a good amount of takeout from Saigon Palace. It's very close to home, they never screw up the order and the Pho is flipping fantastic. I get the Pho Ga which is simply chicken soup and my wife has been enjoying the Pho Chay (a vegetarian soup).The takeout is well organized with separate containers for the broth and for the noodles. And another separate container for the bean sprouts, limes, hot peppers and fresh basil leaves.I don't know about the other foods they offer. The last time I had the Chinese, it was just meh. But the pho? It's PHO-bulous.
Takara Japanese Restaurant=Takara is the best Japanese/Sushi restaurant in Madison easily! If your looking for great sushi at a reasonable price go for the Takara Lunch Special. For two rolls and either soup/salad it is only $9.50 and for three rolls and either soup/salad it is only $12.25, you can not get a whole lot better than that. The spicy California roll is by far the best roll available. I have tried getting spicy California rolls at other restaurants since trying theirs and I have never found something that comes even close to Takaras. Takara is also a great place to go for Hibachi. I love sitting around the table while the food is cooked in front of us. It is great for special occasions whether you are on a date or with a group of friends for a birthday.
Alzohour Market=There ( almost ) is no need to hop the Marrakech Express since we have Alzohour Market right here in Phoenix. Islamic clothing , groceries and other items are sold here but there also is a very modest small Moroccan Restaurant and Bakery here. The food we tried was delicious. Service was VERY pleasant but terribly slow. I think it took them a half hour to bring our beverages. Only one  other small table was in the restaurant and our meal was a two hour stay so that should be noted. I also noticed that table of four people had each plate delivered to them one by one and NOT TOGETHER! I think it might be very hectic for them to serve more than two tables at a time.We shared the B'Stilla. It's a Moroccan Appetizer. It's a very large House Made Phyllo Pastry stuffed with shredded chicken, almonds, and cinnamon. It very delicious and certainly unique. It really feeds four or more people but we wanted to try it.Then we shared another Moroccan dish the Fish Tangine. It was Cod on a sizzling skillet in a Tomato based sauce with onions ,  bell peppers , preserved lemons and exotic spices. It was very fragrant and spicy! They gave us side salads and a big plate of fluffy long grain rice to share.You can get Moroccan without the hassle of going to Marrakech. This building is Halal that means no pork is in the building and a big wall of A Grade Maricopa inspection reports are posted on the window.
Thai Basil=Came here on a date (which sucked BTW)  but onto the food. Great atmosphere and friendly fast workers. The food is yummo however if you're into spicy spicy this isn't the place. Overall I'm giving it a 5. I recommend itI will never spend another dollar at this establishment after how I was treated today. I located Thai Basil's menu online to order dinner. I called the number on their website and a man answered. I told him I wanted to place an order for delivery. He asked me my address, which is about two miles from the restaurant. I placed my order and he told me it would arrive in 15 minutes to one hour. I waited an hour and when my food still hadn't arrived, I called the restaurant. The man I spoke to earlier said the delivery person was out sick and it would be an additional 30-40 minutes; their delivery was very slow. I asked why he hadn't told me about that earlier--I would have ordered carrypit otherwise--and he proceeded to yell at me and hang up. I called back again and he hung up on me again after proclaiming that the store was too busy and he had no time to talk to me. I then drove to the restaurant; the owner claimed it was extremely busy (it wasn't) and said that the delivery person hadn't even showed up to work until 5:30pm. I reminded him that he told me the delivery person was out sick and he denied it, claiming I called before the delivery person arrived. I showed him on my cell phone where I called to place my order at 6:31pm. The owner screamed at me, put his hand in my face, and refused to give me my food. I demanded my order and he eventually gave me my food, prepared the wrong way and stone cold. I will not tolerated being disrespected and lied to, especially by an establishment I *choose* to patronize. I'd give this place zero stars if I could.
Calabria Italian Kitchen=Calabria is exactly what you are looking for if you are looking for an Italian deli like you would find on the East Coast. You can get sliced meats, sandwiches, salads, fresh pastas and various random grocery items. It's the kind of deli that makes you feel warm and cozy inside. You can eat inside, out back, or take it to go. They even offer breakfast now! No, its not a grocery store or a convenience store, it's a deli. And for me it's the best one in town. The Caprese sandwich is top notch, so are the Italian, Sicilian, and Panino. The Panino and Italian might be the best sandwiches in all of Phoenix (depending on how much meat you want that day...) I don't think you can find anything quite like theirs anywhere else. (Including that place up the road...) I like it because of the diverse menu with options. I like it for the wonderful mozzarella they have. I like it because they carry Snapple. I won't lie...I also like it because the owners are from Boston and we always chat about the Sox when I stop in. It's a great place to stop for lunch or if you don't feel like making dinner.
Fuel & Fuddle=The current 3.5 star rating of Fuel & Fiddle is really fair.  I think it is three star if you go during normal hours and four stars if you go for the late night food specials.There are so many different beers and whiskeys to choose from here, and I was impressed.  I didn't order anything this trip, but I would definitely consider coming here for late night pizza and whiskey.Let me start by saying that the menu is massive.  Anyone can find something to eat here.  My friend and I split the Bada Bing ($10) and On the Lamb pizza ($10).  The Bada Bing was a grilled Italian sausage sandwich with sweet peppers, onions, marinara & provolone.  The sandwich was OK, but it was a bit dry.  The pizza had gyro-style lamb and provolone cheese, and was topped with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber dill sauce.  It was super unique, but I enjoyed it.  The food was pretty standard and nothing to write home about.I would come back for the late night $5 pizza special and to drink, but I don't think I would stop back in just for dinner.  The atmosphere is fairly loud, if that deters you.
Manuel's Mexican Restaurant=Good food, great service. Lunchtime deal is a bargain, and you still get all the yummy, crispy homemade chips and salsa you can eat.GGGGOOOOAAAAALLLLLL
Food Express Chinese Restaurant=During my recent trip to Vegas I figure I'll steer off the usual path and see what the locals truly enjoy here... Looked up online and found Food Express and decided to give it a go...Despite the fact that I've already had an early dinner, I was craving some salt and pepper pork chops so that was my target all along!  Well... gotta say that their S&P pork chop was pretty good... but since I'm from LA, I guess I've had similar quality?  But nevertheless it was made pretty tasty.I wanted to try other dishes so there will most likely be a future review from my next trip...  Thus hopefully increasing the star rating at least one star higher...If the food is good, you may ask why I gave it a 3 stars?  To me... if a customer gives you a bill to break for your bill even though it's not much of a change, you should always give back the change and let the customer decide what to do with the rest of the money... well, the guy hands me my food and said thank you....  I was going to give him the tip anyway but I didn't understand why he didn't place it in the tray and let me make that decision.... why does he have to make that decision for me?  Yes... I'm Asian, but I definitely would never do that because the change is still "not my money until given"  So that irked me quite a bit even if it's a little bit of chump change...Hopefully my next visit all the food will be fanstastic and that they will actually give me my change back.... if not, I'm gonna once again raise hell on yelp about it for sure!Don't mind my rant.... enjoy your hot and crispy pork chops!My experience here wasn't as great as I thought it would be based on the number of average stars Food Express has for the number of reviews.  We had a language problem a couple of times last night.I ordered the moo shu pork for an appetizer for the two of us and chicken with green beans for a main course, also to be shared.  The moo shu was brought out in a relatively quick time.  There were four plump pancakes filled with goodness.  It appears that Food Express used the tortilla like wrappers instead of the thinner, traditional pancakes.  The rolls were flavorful but before we even had one eaten, the server was back with our main course.  I hate that so much.When the chicken arrived, it was not chicken with green beans but chicken with broccoli.  That was a language problem or simply an error on the server's part.  We took the meal.  I wouldn't waste that food for one vegetable.When we were finished, I asked if there was a dessert menu.  The server mumbled something, pointed to the kitchen, and then left the table.  A few minutes later, he came back with two small bowls of warmed, sweetened red bean soup which was our dessert I guess but he never said anything more.My wife didn't care for her dessert so I finished two.  I'm glad it was small.There are many things on the menu I'd love to try but I'm a little gun shy.  I'm not sure I'll be back.  Spring Mountain Road, I think I'll go your direction next time.
Tyber Creek Pub=Walking in expecting to see a hostess or something, we kind of just meandered in and found a table. The backless stools looked brand new yet still fit with the old world pub feel. We were greeted by the barkeep who came out to take our orders. We had one menu to look at to make our selections. Small but sufficient bar food menu and a decent jumbled listing of beers. They were all written in one run on sentence like paragraph using commas to separate them so i really couldn't say how many drafts they had. i know i had Big Boss Blanco Diablo and a $3 Guinness. Thursday is $3 pint night for all drafts i believe, but everyday is $3 Guinness day.i went with the buffalo chicken sandwich which apparently comes with a super sized  extra large amount of fries. Plain old fries that could use some love from a seasoning salt of some sort. The buffalo was decent and the chicken was a hearty portion.Overall, i liked our service and meal. Can't say i'd recommend coming solely for the meal, unless you come armed with the Entertainment coupon then it is definitely worth trying (bogo entree) or if you are longing for an authentic pub feel and are going to have some drinks. (i've never been to a real pub, but it seems authentic), i imagine we'll venture back if for nothing else to use the 2011 Entertainment Book coupon.
Marcia's Long Wong's=It's nitty, it's gritty, the food is AWESOME and the clientile & staff is straight hood! It's in the middle of the REAL south side of Phoenix right off of Central & Baseline. It's crazy awesome. At first glance ifs pretty colorful and kind of cool, if it were wiped down with rags dampened with clorox! LOL! This is TOTALLY my kind of place!! Its straight hood! It's in a strip mall and is between a Chinese food place and a day labor place. It's kind of crazy there. If you're dining after dark I FULLY recommend ordering things to go because there's been shootings there before. Two that I know of, but YO she shouldn't have looked at her like that! GAH! JK! There are a few retro video games there and a couple of pool tables and there's also a bar in the back! (yay!!) but the bar scene isn't that great. But the booze is cheap! (double yay!)Like all Long Wongs, this place is known for their hot wings which are made fast, cheap & delicious! their suicide wings are the owner's pride and joy and trust me... they're HOTT!! I once downed an entire pitcher of Margaritas while scarfing on a dozen trying to win a bet. And at the end of the night, I prevailed while holding my head up HIGH before I crashed down to the floor cuz I was trashed! They have the usual greasy spoon food and it's all at fair prices. They also have bbq and solid dinners. Like speghetti or steak dinners. I'm a huge fan of their fried zucchini. This place is very rough around the edges but it's still the small neighboor place that it was intended to be. Where those in know which side of the menu to order from. Where drunks get trashed in the back room bar. Where hustlers get gullable rez girls (like me) to bet them $20 a ball at some 8ball. where sometimes fights break out - but it's not a terrible thing. I don't know how to explain it... Its home. It's rough, it's the hood but the people are real. There is NO pretention in this place. It's straight up good food at straight up good prices. You can have a great time here - I have had many... just keep an eye on your purse.
Yoko Hama Sushi=I give this place 3.5 stars.  I live very close by, and opt to go here or even order out.  Good sushi -- haven't had a bad experience here yet.  The staff is very friendly.My favorite dishes here are:The Volcano Roll, which is a baked california roll topped with scallops and mayo and rolled up in salmon,The Tuna Karai Sashimi, which is an awesome Japanese version of Hawaiian poke,and the Johnny Roll, a deliciously light shrimp tempura wrapped in cucumber.Besides the all you can eat they also have bento boxes available.  Overall a great place to eat sushi on the northwest side. :)
The Seafood Center=Madison may as well be located in the high desert when it comes to QUALITY seafood... well, actually, that's not true - I've had some of the most amazing sashimi of my entire life while in Joshua Tree, California.  So much for that analogy.But you get my point - Madison consumers don't have many options for fresh, quality fish, nor do we have a ton of knowledgable fish mongers to work with.We do, however, have The Seafood Center!  And, holy catfish (sorry Angie from FTS), are these guys awesome!  I felt like making fish tacos last night, so we fired-up Yelp and found a few recommendations for fresh seafood.  My first choice, "Seafood Center" on Junction Road closed on January 1.  In a panic, I raced over to this location and was relieved to find them open, and very busy.The location is small, but don't let the size deter you - they are packed to the gills with fantastic fish.  There's also a kitchen in the back that offers a variety of deep fried piscine platters, but I was there for the uncooked stuff.A super friendly monger asked if he could assist me with anything.  I told him I was planning to do some grilled fish tacos and was considering Halibut, Tilapia, or Mahi.He immediately offered that they were out of Mahi, and that he only had about half-a-pound of Halibut left.  The Tilapia, while farmed, was fresh and would be "fine" for a taco.  He then suggested I check out the Corvina - it had arrived earlier in the day, was line caught, and would be superb for grilling.  He offered me a smell of the fish - it was completely odorless - the whole shop is odorless, in fact - and that's a good sign when shopping for fish.I took 1.25 pounds of the Corvina - he skinned it for me, wrapped it in plastic, put it on ice, and presented me with the bounty.  I haven't had that kind of experience since I lived in San Francisco and Austin.I will be back!!!  This place is truly incredible, and I hope Madison will continue to support this location.  If you're looking for some awesome seafood, swing through The Seafood Center - it's definitely the real deal.Oh - so how were the tacos?  Amazing!  I marinated the Corvina in lime, cilantro, jalapeno, and a splash of tequila, then grilled it on the Big Green Egg for about 9 minutes or so (at 400F).  Whipped-up some incredible spicy slaw, some black refried beans, and an amazing sauce.  A corn tortilla and a slice of avocado made for a stellar dinner.  None of it would've been possible without the help of The Seafood Center (and Yelp)!
Rolando's Mexican Food=Rolando's occupies a former Taco Bell carcass and has been here for ten years.  Why have I been missing this place?  I'm not afraid of dingy booths and a CASH ONLY sign!They may look like one of your typical indie mexican fast foods with the big white menu board with red and green letters, but they really served up some delicious food when I stopped in for some takeout this weekend.Two friendly dudes were running the show, and one of them was even wearing a chef's coat.  I thought it was silly at first, but not after tasting the cuisine they plated up in styrofoam showcase boxes.Shredded chicken tacos, even with a fried, hard shell, were not the least bit greasy, and even though they fell apart while eating them I was able to fork up every single bit of the remains without dodging any greasy or fatty bits (NO DISCARD PILE!).   The same applied to soft corn shell carne asada tacos, with fresh made guacamole and tomatoey-onioney-cilantroey pico de gallo.  I didn't have the beans, but even they didn't look greasy at all, and the rice was fluffy and light, if a bit on the bland side.The 'green' sauce was absolutely yummy, with enough spiciness but flavorful heat, not show-off heat.Rolando's having a guy in a chef's coat is no joke; this is mexican fast food at its finest and for cheap, too!  Spending less than $14 on two full combos meant plenty left over for some Stone IPA to wash it down.Of the non-chain Mexican food places in my area, this is the closest to where I live but it took me a few years to finally try it out. That's because it doesn't have the flashy signs and banners that the other places have, and because the small, somewhat run-down building fades into the background of the countless business and food establishments in the area. But while it serves standard small Mexican food joint fare, the food here is good; not exactly fast food, as it took a while for me to get what I ordered, but the quality is a tad above that of the ubiquitous 'Berto-type  restaurants of the Valley.
Wah Kee Wonton Noodle=Great place for Chinese noodle dishes. They  make their noodles fresh every day. Extensive menu includes interesting dishes from multiple regions in China. There are plenty of rice dishes as well.My husband ALWAYS orders the bun ga, a pork noodle dish served in a bowl with a sauce on the side. It's probably his favorite meal in Madison and is one of the most popular on the menu.Tonight I had the pan fried crispy noodles with seafood and veg on top. The sauce from the seafood and vegetables slowly migrates through the crunchy noodles, making for great texture. There were at least 5 species of seafood or shellfish plus a nice variety of vegetables. I really liked it and would order it again. As always, portions were large and I'm taking tomorrow's lunch home with me.I also always drink their great ginger tea and enjoy the crab rangoon.
Old Hickory House Restaurant=Consistently the best "purist" BBQ in CLT. Meat is cooked over **real** wood in a pit I would be proud to have in my home (yes, I am a BBQ freak). Wife is instructed to have these guys cater my wake.Most/all the BBQ posers these days cook with gas or electricity. It ain't the same folks. Before you go into a BBQ restaurant, drive around back. Woodpile? If not, keep driving. Is the wood neatly stacked? If so, be suspicious because a fellow smoking meat at 4AM isn't typically neat with his pile. Does the restaurant only seem to smoke during dinner hours? We've got a chain joint near us which cooks electrically, but has a smoke-emitting stack- kinda like a smoke-sign. I refuse to set foot in the place on principal.Hickory House does pork, beef, and chicken. The beef and chicken may be good (can't say), but this **is** North Carolina, folks. The only BBQ worth having in NC is pork. Never order french onion soup at a chinese place, I say. Go to Texas if you want beef.As others have said, this place is a nondescript, brick, rectangle in an area of North Tryon which has seen better days. Ever heard of the Hidden Valley Kings? Lock your car and hide your valuables. Speaking from personal experience, here.This is one of those buildings I wish could talk. The restaurant obviously started out as a road-house of sorts back when this part of the world was out in "the woods". I bet it has a ghost or two roaming around. Looks like the kind of place your parents' doctor/lawyer/accountant met his receptionist for "overtime" work back in the 60's.Personally, I am partial to their chopped BBQ sammich, brunswick stew, and hush puppies. If you're lucky/blessed/living right, your sammich will have some crunchy "outside" in it. You can get the sammich with or without slaw- your choice. I alternate.Brunswick stew is worth driving across town for (I do).The hushpuppies are not health food, but they are addictive. We start out with an order as an appetizer. Don't know where they come from, but they will contribute to my early demise, I'm sure.If you're like me and despise MBA-driven, vinyl restaurants, Hickory House ought to be on your short list. This is the place I hold up as the finest example in CLT of the way BBQ is supposed to be done. Even if the food wasn't 5-star, it is worth a trip just so you can tell your kids about it someday. There are fewer and fewer of these places left every day and we'll all be poorer when they're gone.Yelp, you have served me well...once more. I was suffering through one of  the longest road trips I have ever endured (ATL to DC) and we had to stop for gas. Did a quick search for barbecue near me and I found out Old Hickory was 5 minutes down the road. We walk in and are greeted by the cutest bartender/waitress ever. Behind her all I could see was open fire and what I'd describe as meat heaven. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a barbecue chicken sandwich and all were pleased.Excellent recommendation for a miserable road trip.What appears to be a classic barbecue joint that might have been here for decades, Old Hickory House is feeling its age. But hey, so what? The second clue that it was going to be good was when we noticed that there was no extra sauce on the table. "These folks mean it," I said to my dining companion.We ordered a couple of barbecue platters it is was more than decent. Finely chopped pork and beef topped with a sauce that was both tomato based and still had a good vinegar kick. I had mine with beans and Brunswick stew. A basket with four slices of excellent Texas toast was also delivered.A very different Brunswick stew from one I've ever had before. While it's probably an old family recipe, it was mush (like an oatmeal texture) and had quite a lot of corn in it. Strange?
Razzoo's Cajun Cafe=There aren't many Cajun restaurants in the area to compete w/ Razoo's.  However, this place won't disappoint! If you like spicy food you will enjoy eating here. They serve 'Nawlins style food including fish, chicken, and crawdads/crayfish. This is only place in the area that I know of that serves crawfish. If you aren't a fan of seafood, the menu is big enough to accommodate your tastes. Additionally, the drinks here are great. Sometimes, my friend and I come here on Friday nights just for a drink or two. I love their frozen "Mardi-rita" and potent "Worm Burner."The service is good/average and the decor is colorful, as the theme is Mardi Gras-esque.
Pepe's Tacos=Ghetto mexican food. Located in the shadiest of spots, it remains open 24/7food is better if you are inebriated but otherwise still decent.Nothing special mexican taco stand, food is kinda bland nothing too spicy. Pork was kinda tough, beff was stringy, chicken was dry.No pico? WTF!! Place looked like the person cleaning the dining room went to break right in the middle and left their stuff strung all over.I would avoid this place-really kinda shitty but hell it's a long ways before anything else if you live in this neighborhood. poor you.OK so this is really a fun review I am excited to add to my Yelp collection!At approximately 2am in the morning my Yelp buddy Jon calls and invites me for a bite out. Yes, even though I was already in bed relaxing watching tv, I accepted his invite as I am very spontaneous and always ready to stuff my mouth! OK so I got dressed, he was at my house in 15 or so minutes and we were on our way headed to Pepe's!I had eaten here once before pre-yelp days. This time was most definitely Yelp worthy, we were craving tacos so tacos we had!First off they are open 24/7 to satisfy our late night and early morning munch cravings!The tacos were good, I ordered a chicken and asada soft taco plate which came with rice and beans. My pal ordered birria soft tacos which were delicious, I have never had marinated goat meat, he gave me a taste of his and those were yummy as well.Reminds me of the street and truck tacos you can get in town, definitely better than the other more commercial Mexican food joints around. We had fun sitting, chatting and grubbing! Although the food was great I still have many other taco joints to check out!Mmmm until the next mouth stuffing rendezvous I am out :) Peace!I remember when this was originally "Miller's Steakhouse". That place was no good but, Pepe's took over years ago and it seems to have stuck. Being a fan of Pepe's in Cali I was always hesitant about trying this place. I didn't know if it was the same or completely different. With only one way to find out I headed on my way. The parking lot was packed. I was lucky to nab the last spot. It was busy inside. I placed my order and waited maybe 8-10 minutes for my food. I saw others waiting too so I knew it might be a minute and they were cooking it fresh. I ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" and the "Cheese Quesadilla". The tortillas are yummy. The burrito was good in size and tasted decent but wasn't spectacular. The real winner was the quesadilla. It was cheeeeeesy! I noticed a sign inside that said they only accepted cash however the cashier asked me if I wanted to pay with cash or debit. Pepe's is open 24 hours.I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!Pepe's compared to Roberto's. Pepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.Also the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.Overall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.The only thing I would do different is keep the salsa station clean.So it usually bothers me when someone puts they have the best fill in the blank in town.. However, Pepe's Taco can do it. They have my seal of approval. In their establishment they have a sign that reads best carne asada nachos in town. They aren't wrong. They have great food for a great price. I came here for some late night ratchetness and brought along a friend to fatten him up. First thing I notice when I walk in is all the seating. Usually places only have a couple seat for you to wait or a couple tables on the side for people dining in. This location had seats on either side and some cool benches. On Yelp it says they close at 2, but they are actually open 24 hours which I was thankful for. Who knew you could sit and talk in a taco shop for almost 2 hours. I of course had to be fat and order the nachos. My friend ordered some pork tacos. We sat down and waited for our food. I see them all the time and it makes me laugh but they have the posted signs for no refills or there will be an additional charge. I think we refilled our drink like 5 times and nothing was said.. I know they are trying to watch their costs and whatnot but it's like cents per cup. They also have a jukebox that randomly plays music and stares the pee out of you. After getting my food I hit the salsa bar and grab green salsa, my favorite, and some limes. I know it was late but everything seemed kind of empty. I think grabbed the last limes.. oh well. They i opened my box and went in on my nachos. They had everything a little separated which I liked. All in all I had a fun time being ratchet at 1 in the morning.
Captain Bill's Subs=Ahh Captain Bill's Sub Factory.  If you rep the metrocenter area as I have since my birth in 73 then you no doubt have eaten at Captain Bill's.  I've been eating subs there for nearly 25 years.  This place is a true phoenix landmark.Simply put, I love this place.  I love everything about it.  Where else can you roll in with 3 bucks and roll out full?I used to ride my skateboard up there in the mid eighties and take the trash out for the many hot chicks both from cortez and moon valley that worked there at the time and they would feed me free subs.  Then I would play 720 until they kicked me out.Nothing beats a Captain Bills Italian sub.  Nothing.I continued to go there over the years, I got married, I had kids and I took them there.As I sat there this afternoon with my 16 year old son feeling sentimental as the faces of those I knew so long ago stared back up at me from the tables.  I vowed to never eat a sub anywhere ever again but at good ole Captain Bill's.As we left my son commented that the chicks were hot.  "They always were" I said, "they always were."Thanks Bill.While on the hunt for something for the family to quickly eat at a nearby Basketball Tournament , we decide to give ole Bill a try.  Love the  kitschy vibe of this place.Tons of  funny- to obnoxious stickers and signs plaster the place.   For a minute I thought it was Two Hippies Sub shoppe.  But this little hole in the wall does a soild business slinging out the standard american sub.  While nothing to flavorful was ordered by my Troupe, I am willing to go back and find the hidden gems that must be in  this dive.   Word to the Wise bring cash or be prepared to pay a dollar fee for a debit /credit card... really?
O'Aces Bar & Grill=Great local neighborhood bar! Came in with friends to watch the Chargers ...lose... But still had a great time. Reid the bar manager made our night so fun, he's great! I talked myself out of eating because I'm 1 fry away from gaining 10 lbs but the drinks were great! Love the low sitting comfortable chairs too :)
The Paradise Lounge=This is basically the only acceptable bar to go to in Madison, WI if you are not a hippie or college student. It is dingy, it is gross, the bartenders are surly and these is a distinctive 'dise smell that permeates your clothing and your soul. I love it like a second home. The drinks are cheap, the place is LOADED with interesting people, (read possible criminals? senators with their escorts? other assorted ne'er-do-wells? who cares?) the music is loud and Misfit-y. The bartenders aren't THAT surly and some still remember me some 5 years after leaving Madison. They make the drinks strong, and they are FAST!It gets pretty packed after 9 on any given night, so I recommend getting there early. Around noon is acceptable. The food's pretty top notch. It is your typical bar fare, but if I hear another person rave about the 'dise burger, I may have to abandon my vegetarian principals to find out how awesome it is for myself. Luckily, I will always have the the cheese balls, which are vegetarian-ish.Thier greasy, stringy, melty dipped in ranch cheesiness has me missing Wisconsin on a semi-regular basis. For the vegans in your life, there are green olives. Soaked in vodka. Just eat them. 5 years and 3 trips back to Madison, this is the place I have the airport cabbie drop me off first.Giving it a 5, if you're a hipster or frat kid this isn't the bar for you (thank goodness) beer is cheap service fast
Super Mex Restaurant & Cantina=We really like Super Mex.  It has pretty decent Tex Mex offerings and a pretty large menu.  They even have a discounted and a "lite" menu, for even more options.  You are bound to find something you like here.We started going to Super Mex when I found a few buy one get one coupons from the Vegas Entertainment book.  I love a good coupon and the place was around the corner from where hubby works, so of course we had to go.  I am so happy we went too because the food is pretty yummy!  It is good, solid Tex Mex style food at reasonable prices.Our favorite dishes are the chimichangas, gigantic burritos, tacos, and the flautas.   I actually get the chimi 8 out of 10 times that we go because they are so addictive!  You can even get them enchilada style, meaning covered in red enchilada sauce and cheese, which is simply AMAZING!  My hubby is the same way with the tacos.  Yummy!On top of the menu items, you also get chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The chips are actually tostadas that you break apart and scoop the yumminess onto.  The salsa at Super Mex is really good too.  It doesn't taste like your average salsa from other places.  It is darker in color and has different layers of flavor.  Tasty!  And the bean dip rocks.  I usually finished it off before my hubby and daughter can even get a bite.  Hey, you snooze, you lose when there is bean dip on the table next to me!The service here is hit and miss though.  Sometimes you get awesome service and sometimes not.  That is why I wen with 3 stars.  The food is easily 4 stars and is pretty consistent in my opinion.So see you at Super Mex.  I will be the one stuffing my face with a chimichanga!
Great Wall Buffet Two Corporation=They're a 3 1/4  in my book, although a seafood fan might be more impressed.There was a lot of seafood to select on Saturday for lunch, which I did not try, but saw plenty of classy customers literally carrying handfulls away from the boofay.  No kidding, there were multiple people doing it -- stacking their plate so high with crab legs that they had to hold the pile in place with their free hand draped over the top while walking back to the table.  Class like that you don't find in other cities, for sure, but the West side? Sheeeeeeet..Aside from the abundant shellfish, I found a moderate assortment of chicken dishes, beef ribs, and plenty of the usuals, with the addition of a neat flour shell chicken taco thing I really enjoyed.Discard Pile~2.5McKenna Novelty Factor~3.5Greasy / Crispy Spectrum~3NQI * ~ big fat ZERO               The napkins were stupid.  They were too small and way too thin with no absorbancy and no gription at all.  I don't care how much cheaper they were for the restaurant to buy than a normal napkin, I had to go through two dozen of the little shits, making a huge pile of sticky, greasy wads on the table and plate.  With ribs and crab legs, all of the customers were using at least as many as was I.  Unless they pay less than 1/24th the price of the same number of normal napkins, they're wasting money on those little shit napkins.  Yeah, they left me pretty pioughd.* Napkin Quality indicatorAnother ciriteria of mine for judging a boofay or other restaurant.  Cloth or paper? What kind of paper quality and thickness? How many did it take to do the job?

Bandung Indonesian Restaurant=Confession: I have been to Indonesia and had plenty of local Indonesian food. So my standards are high and my comments might not represent the masses.First let's talk about the service. The waitresses were less than friendly/ professional. One of them interrupted my boyfriend when he was asking her a question. When I asked her what was in a particular dish, she said, "exactly as it says on the menu: beef, onions, peppers, etc.". I wondered if I looked blind or illiterate to her? Then when I asked her to heat up a soup dish because it was cold, she said "well, it shouldn't be cold, because it just came off the stove". I guess she either likes her soup cold, or she doesn't understand the difference between "putting it on the stove" and "serving the soup after it boils". It took her forever to take the soup back out to us. Shortly after we were done, she dropped the check on our table without saying anything. When we had to wait for change, she took so long we had to go up to the counter to ask for it. Now let's talk about the food. Before I went to Bandung, I asked my Indonesian friend and my other friend who works there for suggestions. So naturally, I ordered the "authentic" and "best dishes" of the house: SATE KAMBING (marinated lamb skewers with rice cakes), RED CURRY SQUASH, and SOTO AYAM (lemon grass flavored broth with chicken breast, bean sprouts, green onion, egg and mung bean noodle). Well, the Sate Kambing and Soto Ayam came out COLD, which they were NOT supposed to be. There was way too much sauce on the lamb, and the portion is very small for it's price ($12.95 for 6 tiny skewers). Also, the rice cake was very lumpy and mushy. I could barely tell that it was rice. The Soto Ayam was way too salty. Red curry squash was ok, but I could have had this dish at any Thai- or Asian-inspired restaurants. Meh.This is one of the few situations when bad service coupled with worse-than-average food truly ruined my evening. I was very excited about going to an Indonesian restaurant and I went home completely unsatisfied and disappointed.If you ever have dinner with me in the near future it's likely you'll hear me say: "Let's get something spicy, I mean like Bandung spicy." "Let's get something really creative, I mean like Bandung creative.""Let's get something super flavorful, I mean like Bandung super flavorful." (You see where I'm going, yes?)Bandung has set the standard for me here in Madison of what it means to bring spice, flavor and creativity into a really interesting dish that you're not going to find on any other menu in town. I'll be honest, after reading the reviews online and driving by the dumpy little strip it's in, I didn't have much reason to check out the inside. BUT, Tenth & Blake hosted a Yelp Elite event last month which served as my first introduction and I couldn't wait to get back. (But I did, like 3 weeks... what the hell was I thinking?!)The menu is huge, there's something for everyone regardless of if you like spice or not. There are also safe options if you're not ready to plunge into Indonesian right away (but just do it). I started with a chicken and steak skewer and holy cow... for grilled meat these things are bomb. So much flavor. So much great char on the outside but juicy and moist on the inside. From there I moved on to the Ikan Rica Rica and I need to pause and collect my thoughts... ...This dish, without a doubt is one of the best things I've had in Madison, certainly the best fish dish. An ENORMOUS filet of mahi-mahi is lightly breaded and served on a bed of steamed vegetables with a lime leaf and candle nut sauce and diced tomatoes, ginger and sambal. Holy cow... HOLY COW! my mouth is watering just thinking about the little bit I have left in the fridge (it's big). There aren't really words to describe how good this dish is. A cornucopia of spicy, sweet flavors and flaky fish. The veggies are flavorful! Not just steamed mush. Just go, get it, you won't be disappointed.But if you are disappointed, send me a message. I'll take you back to Bandung (my treat) if you have a one-star experience. Because honestly I don't know how that's possible. Seriously. If you truly believe it's one star, I'll meet you there and we'll find you a favorite. (I'm looking at you Maria.)The folks easy make it into my top 5 in Madison. And they should be in yours too.I don't understand. I just don't get it.Why doesn't this place have a bajillion reviews? There's nothing else like it.Why is it that nobody knows what I'm talking about when I mention it? Why is it always empty at lunch?Maybe people are so overcome by the flavor profiles they aren't certain what to write? Maybe I don't know enough adventurous eaters? Maybe everyone goes there at dinner? LUNCH IS WHERE IT'S AT YOU GUYS! Dishes range from 8.50-11.00, pack quite a punch and offer up the perfect amount of food. This is probably the one place in town where I don't get the same thing time and time again, because the menu is so interesting... so diverse and it'll take you months to try everything. I thought I had a favorite, you can read my earlier review, but the catfish today blew me away. Sweet, salty, spicy it had everything I look for but didn't leave me feeling over full. The crisp veggies and perfectly portioned rice round out the meal. And if catfish isn't your thing, eye over their other seafood options. They are plentiful, and servers are equipped with tons of knowledge about each dish. Go.Eat.LOVE.I look forward to the day I go at 12:30 and they say, "Sorry it's going to be about 25 minutes until we can seat you."In the mood for comfort Indonesian food? It exists!We ordered from Bandung about a year ago, and I know I loved my indo mac n cheese. We somehow never made it into the building itself until a Yelp Elite event. Yay!Nice interior, and especially nice bar area. Big and open. The bartender was sassy and funny, and made us some great cocktails. Helloooo, Thai Iced Tea. We also nibbled on bites like cream cheese filled wontons and chicken wings (well, Derek did that one).For our meals, Derek got chicken pad thai and I got the tofu fried rice. We ordered them off the small bites/happy hour menu. SO cheap! Derek's pad thai was much better than my fried rice. It was peanut-y and not too sweet. My fried rice was just a little too dry for my taste, but I liked the flavor overall. And each plate was piled high.Thanks for a great treat! Can't wait to visit again and try something new.Real good food, real nice staff - especially the hostess! Although very busy, she was greeting people, seating people, working with the kitchen by bringing food out, and even helping out a newbie waitress on her first day alone - all with a smile on her face. Nothin' but kindness, which only added to the cozy and warm atmosphere here.When it comes to food, you cannot go wrong with the Krakatau. We chose chicken, which was served sizzling, in a sweet garlic sauce. I did not taste garlic, but it was damn good nonetheless. Another item we enjoyed was the Bakmi Goreng - a very large portion of egg noodles flavored with soy sauce, mixed with an assortment of veggies. Definitely a filling and delicious meal.Although stuffed, I could not pass up on dessert. Ordered the Pisang Goreng and I fell madly in love. I've posted a photo, and yes, it does taste as good as it looks.Guess what you can now get at night, folks, that you couldn't get before? A smaller portion of pretty much ANYTHING ON THE MENU! That's right, where you once had to head there for lunch in order to feast on flavorful dishes a bit smaller in size and lower in price, you can now order many of your lunch favorites at dinner! The redesigned menu lays it all out pretty clearly, showing you different price-points for different sizes, at lunch your meal comes with an appetizer, and at night a basket-o-chips! If you aren't able to make it over there mid-day and are nervous about committing to a large dish at dinner, there's no excuse now to give them a try! It's an 8-11 buck investment in some of the most intriguing and flavorful food you'll find in the area.I've dined at Bandung of my own accord and with a Yelp event, and both trips were unique in the dishes and flavors I was able to try.My first experience here was on a chilly day and I ordered the perfect entree to warm up. I settled on the Pad Rum Mit, which was chicken stir fried with broccoli, fresh mushroom, napa, baby corn and pea pods in a light spicy garlic sauce. White rice was served alongside the hearty plate and made for a great deal of food.The next time at Bandung was with Yelp and we sampled the pangsit keju (cream cheese wontons) as a group. I then ordered the Gado Gado as my entree, which was a steamed green bean, carrot, cabbage, broccoli, bean sprouts, egg and tempeh topped with mild peanut sauce. The peanut sauce made the plate. Without it, I would not be loving this dish so much as the combination of cooked and raw veggies, along with the ever interestingly textured tempeh, was weird. When topped with peanut sauce though, I could pretty much polish the plate.  I will certainly be back to try more of their dishes once the weather cools down and curries begin calling my name.
Yasda Bento=I was all geared up to eat at the ELEPHANT of all Thai restaurants, but when I got there... it was too busy.  So the wife and I shuffled next door to this gem.I overheard this used to be "Yoshi's" which kind of makes sense.  Its the same Japanese style bowls, but oh-so-much better.First off, they have pictures of their dishes plastered all over their walls and doors.  They all look good but then I heard an angel and she steered my wicked eyes toward the holy grail of dishes... Bulgoki.  I was overwhelmed.  I grabbed my wife's shoulder to avoid dropping to my knees in praise to the Japanese Bowl gods.  Lucky for me my wife is young and strong or I would have taken her down with me.I, of course, order the Bulgoki and my wife orders the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken.  My wife grabs a table outside and I grab a pomegranite and jasmine iced tea and as many napkins as my miniature hands could carry (in preparation for the feast).  The wait was nil.  If it had been any shorter of a wait, time would be going backwards and I would have been dining with Socrates. Thankfully, I was still with my wife and I joined her at our table.  Her Chicken was too spicy for our liking, but we both liked the Bulgoki. DUH!Anyway, this place is rockin'To sum it up, the wait was great and the dish was delish.BTW Chris,  Its spelled with a G not a K! Like this "BULGOGI".
China Garden Restaurant=Good food, great service and they have been there since 1980...WTF a business that is still around after 30 years... must be good.So my coworker was really promoting this place to me, and I felt like Chinese food so our decision was made.......Horrible mistake!Number One: Disgusting bland food. Every single (limited selection) dish sucked! The orange chicken tasted like old microwaved from freezer over sauced cardboard. The onion rings were crap. The egg rolls, crap. The chow mein noodles which I thought were supposed to look brown, were these pale watery strans of crap. The rice, which was clearly not white rice, was bland. The desserts sucked as well. Also, the presentation of the food looked very sloppy. Number Two: Horrible enviornment. Ugly pink walls with horrible dollar store decorations. The booth seats were WAAAAYYY to close to the tables which made for an uncomfortable sitting experience. The sneeze guards were dirty. Weird smell. And stupid layout, with a couple of booths too close to the employee personal area and some too close to the (again small) buffet line. Number Three: After this review, I am calling the health services on this disgustng place. A couple of times I noticed an employee scratching their nose, and then continuing with their work. Then I was forcing down my food when my coworker spots a moving insect on the wall next to us. It was a BABY COCKROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screw this place. I will never ever go back here. And if this place isnt shut down, I hope nobody else does either. On the plus side, its only $6.00. But still not worth it. If I could, I would give this place negetive 1000000000000000000000 stars.If you're looking for the same americhino fare that you had here in 1983, well, there it is.  Same menu, same recipes, same grease.There's nothing too terrible about their greasy, fried: (rice, egg rolls, chicken, chicken wings, sesame chicken, onion rings, egg foo young, s&s pork, and jello).Yes, even the jello was deep fried and greasy.  Not really.There's just not much selection, and what you get is 'mbleh'.(that's half 'meh' and half 'blah')Everyone keeps saying "well, at least it's only $6."  Well, for that price, I could pick from a half dozen gems within a mile radius of this nostalgic black hole boofay of yester-year.But I'll generously round them up -  they're friendly, the food's tasty and filling, and fuggit it was only $6.
TGI Friday's=Ok so who has not eaten at Friday's?This review is dedicated to my sweetheart ex Chris whom took me here to dine over and over again, pre Yelp days. Seriously we probably ate here close to 20 times within one year.***Sign up for the Stars and Stripes club online and you will get monthly emails for buy one get one free meal*** This is the ONLY reason we would visit so often, the savings we could not resist and the food is good!* Side note looks like they have changed recently, now they are offering buy one get one half off meal, not the same as bogo they have been doing the last couple of years :(We used to both order the Jack's Signature steak and shrimp dinner, they would take off $19.99 the price of one of our meals, was so worth it.Anything dipped in or covered in the Jack's signature sauce is delicious!I always ask for extra Jack Daniel's sauce, mmmm and is really good when you use it as a dip for sweet potato fries! The bomb diggity!Awwwww the sweet memories, have not been in awhile.This location rocks! Avoid the Friday's located in casino's example Orlean's Hotel & Casino as that one sucks ass.
Burger King=This BK is near my house and I get coupon booklets in the mail often. I wouldn't eat here as much if I didn't have the coupons. The burgers are fast food average and the veggies are usually fresh. The workers are nice but the wait time can be brutal often. I do like the cinnabon options they have I just don't like when they put in the box and bag upside down so that when I open it the frosting isn't everywhere but on the bun.I rate this burger king as a 5 star for ONE REASON...every time I come here they have me pull forward and wait for my chicken sandwich. Most people would typically get frustrated with these actions, but I appreciate the fresh chicken and not giving me a reheated patty. I don't mind waiting two min for fresh food...instead of choking down a dried out microwaved chicken sandwich. Either way...I rarely eat fast food, but this location is bearable.
Original Hamburger Works=Not in a burger mood, I went for the fish n chips.Hello, rubbery batter!*pfffffft* (that's how you spell the sound a fart makes.)Fries were yummy.  Ordering process was organized.*ppffffffffffffttttttttttt*I like the different varieties of tea.  I don't like mine sweetened.Good lunch hour crowd.  Lots of men.*ppppffffftttttt*
Underwraps Cafe=Since Mr. K's excellent review, Underwraps has made a few changes. (Hey! Maybe they read your review?) You can now order salads (five types from Asian or Greek to Caesar or Cobb) and the sides to chose from include potato chips (which ROCK and are made in-house), potato salad or pasta salad (they scratched the fries). The grilled vegetable wrap IS tasty: kalamata olives, grilled squash, roasted green peppers, red onion, lemon vinaigrette, but I also really like to do the scrambled egg (crispy bacon, caramelized onion, tomato and melted provolone cheese). They even make it egg whites only for me!I do think a lot of their business is catering... and they've got some good offers. You can serve 11-14 people assorted wraps for just $50! This place is close to where I work and it's not generally too crowded, so it's easy enough to get in and out. I'm gonna round up and give it four stars for taste and convenience!
Buffet Asia=Buffet @ Asia is a place that has never peaked my interest until recently when a family member raved about their Sunday dinner.    Come Sunday, and you have three ravenous individuals who just came from biking outside in the 107 degree Vegas weather.  (Yeah, we're crazy.)We walked in around 5 pm, and there's already a line.  Straight to the register, $15.99/pp (adults) and we're seated at a table.  There's a Mongolian BBQ station - you pick your veggies and meat and they cook it up on this giant flat stove thing for you.  (We all skipped this, which might explain why we never saw the kalbi short ribs everyone else talked about. Damn.)Sushi - They have a bunch of random rolls with lots of sauce and stuff and some salmon sashimi.  That was something we all avoided as well.Seafood - green mussels, baked scallops (my friend wasn't sure if there was scallop in there b/c they mix it up with stuff and cover it up with sauce), jumbo hot shrimp (old), cooked cold shrimp (fresh, and not overly cooked - over by the salad bar section), oysters on the half shell (big ones - okay, a bit too 'milky' for me), lobster, salt and pepper crab (not the freshest), snow crab legs (we mostly ate this and a lot of it, with drawn butter), deep-fried frog legs (old), deep-fried calamari (okay), baked salmon, clams (pretty good), and I'm sure a few other things I overlooked.  (There was no crawfish though, unfortunately!)Cooked items - stir-fried strings beans (I ate a lot of this), mixed veggies with shrimp, beef and broccoli, fried rice, steamed rice, asparagus, potstickers (skin was old), crab ragoons, eggrolls, deep-fried chicken wings, etc.Soup - wonton soup, oxtail soup, egg drop soup.Dessert - fresh fruit and marshmallows for dipping into chocolate, egg custard tarts (blah), almond cookies, soft serve, almond jello with fruit cocktail, mango mousse, sesame balls, malasadas (would be better if they were hot), tapioca, and a few other things.Service is super attentive, especially in clearing plates.  They greet you right away with beverage orders and it's not to hard to wave them down for refills, extra napkins, shell crackers, etc.Overall, you really can't complain about the price.  We went on one of their more expensive nights and I think we had enough crab to definitely surpass our money's worth.  You have to wonder how they even turn a profit.  Some of the food is just blah, but at least you can have a taste and never get more.  And then there's a handful of things that will have you returning for more.  It works for picky eaters too.  Their menu seems to be changing all the time, so you never know what you're gonna get!  I've had better buffets (that cost more), and worse Asian ones too.  They obviously are doing something right because there's a lot of people dining here.My Mom loves this place and comes here at least once a month.  I, on the other hand, think it's just A-OK.  There's a nice selection of food, but it seems lacking to me.  Here's my +/- breakdown:+ Large selection of food.  There's plenty of options.  They even have Pizza, although I don't recommend it....it's an Asian Buffet for Pete's sake!+ Decent service.  This place is always busy and they usually keep up with the pace.  Food is generally kept stocked on the food lines and the servers keep the glasses full.+ Food quality is OK for a buffet.  It's not great, but hell it's AYCE.....this isn't the Bellagio Buffet.+ Price.  The price use to be really good, but they've been steadily increasing prices over the past couple of years.....but still, $6.99 for a lunch buffet?!  That's pretty cheap in my book.- Parking.  Parking is a bitch when it's busy.....it's not the restaurant's fault though and my Star Rating doesn't reflect this....just saying, FYI.Overall, it's pretty good value.  If you don't like waiting, I suggest going in between meal periods when it's slower than peak times.Return Factor - 75%When you need an all-you-can-eat fix (AYCE F), this place will do it.  Easier than going to a hotel, it's a standalone building with fairly easy parking.  It's cheap, ahem, well-priced.  With Lunch $8.29 & Dinner $12.49 (drinks extra), a little goes a long way.Influenced by Japanese and Chinese cooking, it has all the goodies you can expect.  A plethora of a selection that includes Sushi, Mussels, Fried Dumplings, BBQ Spareribs, noodles, and salad bar for lunch.  Add to that for dinner: Snow Crab, New Zealand Green Mussels, cocktail shrimp, and a small Mongolian section - yum.Take it from me whose dined here 5-6 times over the years, it's A-Okay in my book.PS.  They even have pizza!Decent-enough buffet: lots of seafood and traditional Asian dishes here, though the salads and dessert sections are minimal. A few fried and Americanized options available, making this place a bit more kid-friendly than you might expect.Found it odd that this place also has a full bar? Sushi roll offerings at dinnertime are extensive: several special rolls, though they are not labeled, so be prepared to try a lot or be able to identify the types of fish you do/don't like. Some nigiri available, too.Lots of crab, preference was for the salt and pepper fried Jonah crab claws rather than the typical Alaskan. $13/person weeknight dinner is not outrageous, and you can easily get your money's worth here, but this place isn't likely to blow your mind. Service is also what you'd expect for an Asian buffet, no surprises there.If you enjoy Asian food buffets, are in the area and don't mind feeling sick for a couple days afterwards...stop on in and indulge in the unsanitary overpriced delicacies of the Orient!Been coming here since this place transformed from a prime rib steakhouse back in the mid 1990s and it has drastically gone down hill.For at least a dozen years, Buffet Asia truly was excellent, both lunch and dinner; but something happened. My guess is 1, 2 or more of the following...Ownership change, management change, food distributor, chefs, prep cook training classes were possibly never offered, OSHA and CCHD not involved enough, etc., etc.Upon walking in, the hostess asked us if we needed a table in 1 of the 4 dining areas or if want to eat in the bar. My reply..."No, I do not want to sit in the bar with my children and eat!" So I was given a piece of paper with a handwritten # on it. Took this time to admire the cartoon framed pictures of dogs playing poker, seen on the wall outside the restrooms. This was the best part of our dinner. Went to wash our hands and the men's room floor and mirrors were dirty, trash was overflowing, and both dispensers were out of hand soap.After waiting for at least 20 minutes for a table to eat our dinner, I asked how much longer til our # was up. Shortly thereafter, we were seated at a table in the backroom. The distance was a bit of a struggle for me considering I was using crutches from a recent leg surgery.The friendly server brought us our sodas promptly and kept them refilled throughout our dinner. For this, she earned $2 per person at this self served buffet.The food selection was plentiful...offering an array of chicken, beef and seafood Asian creations...along w/ several fried foods, fruit, sushi, almond cookies and vanilla soft serve ice cream. Thanks to my son helping carry some plates of food, while I was on crutches, I tried a little of many. The skewers of chicken was my favorite.It was very noticeable that many of the food selections were sitting way too long as several items were not being eaten, resulting in foods dried out and clumped together in sticky unappetizing sweet/salty sauces. The area that dining patrons can select veggies and meats, and have the chef prepare custom entrees did not look appealing, as the raw meat selections looked as if they were sitting too long, but we were so hungry especially after the long waiting line up front, that we tried it anyway. Tipped the chef with several bills placed on top of the ordering counter. Overall, what we did eat, was just ok, certainly not the quality nor taste as experienced over the past dozen years or so patronizing this restaurant. The dinner prices were higher than the last dinner and that was higher priced than the previous. Everytime we come here, the price increases to the point it's now comparably priced to nearby hotel buffets.Unfortunately my family and I, each and all of us, felt stomach cramps and related illness within an hour of leaving this dinner, resulting in the purchase of Immodium at a nearby store. Conclusion based on this dining experience...the only things remaining good about this restaurant are some of the people that work there and the customers who don't know any better, and the original cartoon poker playing dog pictures on the wall which came with the sale from The Hungry Hunter about 18 years ago.  1 star for the cute dog pictures and that's being generous!Listed among "Eek! Me thinks not."YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #216
Yummy Grill & Sushi=4.5 stars!Came for dinner the other night, and quickly wanted to comment on the baked dishes.  (Since I am pregnant and must abstain from raw dishes- it gave me a chance to try other items from the menu). Although I was salivating watching my husband enjoy his spicy tuna hand roll, and a complimentary sushi that the chef prepared for him- my volcano roll and seaweed salad were DELICIOUS. We also shared a Red Snapper Teriyaki combination box and we practically licked that plate clean.  Perhaps when I am no longer pregnant, I will order a baked dish again.  Who am I kidding? I am craving their uni and ame ebi like crazy!It never fails that every time I try to write a review for Yummy, it's when Yelp is down for maintenance!  I've been coming here for years (my pre-Yelp years) since I work around the corner. I come here every week almost and this week I was here twice...mostly to-go orders and the occasional  meeting up with Yelpers.   I come here too often that I should be getting desensitized by their food by now...but no!I keep getting the same stuff which is a problem of mine: edamame, salmon sashimi, spicy salmon bowl, any rolls with salmon or tuna.  The quality of fish here is good. I've tried their scallops, blue fin and uni before - those were amazing. It's a good thing I didn't go here alone today and I got to try other items on their lunch menu like their pork belly (one of the best I've had. The fat was rendered well so you don't get that gross glob of fat in your mouth feel), garlic edamame (I stepped away from the regular edamame this time. They were very garlicky and a bit spicy and oh so delicious!) and the Unagi bowl (fresh-tasting eel and the sauce wasn't heavy). Then there were items we got today that didn't wow me: ramen, spicy tuna bowl, spicy pork bowl and the salmon skin salad. I've had better elsewhere. For some reason they went crazy with bonito flakes today. They were either cleaning their pantry or trying to conceal something in our food bowls. But there was definitely a bonito flake party!Service is better during lunch. I never have to wait long for my food the times I've been here maybe because they're more considerate of the working lunch crowd? I should come here for happy hour one of these days. Want to come with?Make sure to check-in with the mobile yelp app for the $10 off $45+ on your bill!My boyfriend and I came on a friday night around 12am and it was packed. I heard and read good things about this place so why not? Their happy hour menu is pretty good with half-off on their select nigiri and simple rolls. They had a large house sake for $4.50 during happy hour.Decor: Small, packed, loud. Clean. Kind of regret not grabbing a seat at the sushi bar! Faster service that way.We ordered a few rolls (Johnny, That's What She Say) to start. It took 30-40 minutes to get 3 rolls types. By the end of the night we had 6 rolls, house sake, and two orders of gyoza in an hour and 40 minutes.The fish was flavorful, fresh, rich, and delicious. Pretty generous on the fish as well. Presentation was beautiful. The sauces were drizzled with care on our rolls. The sushi itself tantalized our taste buds. It's a bit pricey since it's all ala carte and we know it's not all-you-can-eat. For a non-AYCE joint, we expected maybe faster service despite the quality rolls. They came out at a snail's pace that we kept getting hungry in between finishing each roll dish. We felt a bit sorry for the lone waitress doing everything from cleaning, tending to other customers, getting side dish orders etc. She was doing her best to serve everyone though. Maybe the service wouldn't have suffered as much if they had another waitress/waiter or maybe an extra chef. Don't get me wrong, we didn't expect them to come out with our order immediately, but it took FOREVER to get each one!  For the price we paid (Around $80ish by the end of the night just between the two of us), I kind of wished we chose another place. It was a delicious meal, just not-so-great timing on the sushi. I don't mind paying for sushi, but if I'm paying quite a bit extra for an ala carte place, I expected a bit better in terms of timeliness. Maybe we'll come back and try it again on less busy night.I stop into Yummy Grill regularly for Happy Hour.  They have a high standard for their fish, serve a quality products across the board, and their HH is a great value.  They also typically have a Yelp Deal going with a Check-in, though not always compatible with HH Specials. I have not explored most of the menu since I normally come for HH.  HH has a good amount of options, and one of my favorite things to order off the that menu is the Chef's Special Roll.  It changes based on what they have in at the time and also based on what other rolls you order...but it is always excellent!  They are an easy 4 stars in my book...maybe even 4.5 stars.Still the best neighborhood-feel, à la carte sushi restaurant with impressively (and consistently) delicious fish! The live scallop is my favorite - served in the shell. All plates are made with care and attention to detail, which we all know makes sushi great sushi. It is really nice to walk away from a sushi meal without feeling like your belly is about to explode from every homeward-bound pothole (e.g. the all-you-can-eat sushi experience) and Yummy Grill is the perfect place to pare back to sushi basics, simply ordering one or two selections at a time. Enjoying each bite and discussing the flavors with Chef Eric and his crew of skilled fish-slicers makes for a very civilized and satisfying meal.Love the strength of the iced green tea here. And the fish specials on the whiteboard are truly special. Note: This Yummy Grill is not to be confused with or linked to the *other* Yummy Grills in the Vegas area. This is an independently-run store with its own high-end fish purveyors, and this distinction goes way beyond the typical variance among chain franchises. One bite and you'll know you're in a very special spot!Chef Eric is one of the best sushi chefs in town!  He consistently has the absolute freshest fish in town.I started coming in to Yummy Grill for the Happy Hour.  I soon discovered the Omakase (Chef's Tasting.)  Yummy is simply the best in town...and at a price considerably less than Kabuto, Nobu, and Shibuya.  And while those are certainly much classier places with wonderful ambiance, the quality of the product is not better and any of them.You will be hard-pressed to find a place with more live options.  Fans of uni are in heaven here!If you are just getting cut rolls yummy is still a great place to go.  If you are into Nigiri, Sashimi, or Omakase then Yummy is as good as it gets!My sister asked me to have dinner with her after spending all day in the ER with my grandmother. Starving and puzzled where to gorge myself and eat my feelings. Remembering my sister lived by this great sushi place with a reverse Happy Hour, we decided to meet at Yummy Grill & Sushi.Immediately entering, I was greeted with "Moshi, moshi" by all of the staff and sat down with my sister.  Immediately a server came over, greeted us, took our drink orders, and handed us menus. We ordered the garlic edamame; the MOST delicious stuff, ever. I ordered a second round. I wanted to lick the extra sauce left over in it. I also had a bowl of their Miso Soup, excellent as well. Let's get to the sushi. Since it was happy hour (4 PM - 6 PM Sunday through Thursday/ 10 PM - 1 AM everyday),  rolls are priced as low as $2. All happy hour sushi contains 4 pieces and they aren't extra small pieces either. Our drinks arrived with a free portion of their veggie pancake. It had a nice, delicate flavor. We ordered the spicy tuna roll and avocado on top twice (if you've never tried this, do, it's heaven) and they didn't charge me extra (how RARE is that). The shrimp tempura crunch roll was divine, we ordered that twice as well. My sister got an eel roll, which she loved (I love eel sauce, just can't handle the texture. I tried it, it tasted amazing, but let her finish it). We order a Philly roll, which was yummy, you can't go wrong with creme cheese, salmon, and avocado. I especially like that it was fresh salmon. Some sushi places use salmon that has that smokey taste to it and it just ruins it for me. The garlic albacore came with the garlic sauce on the side; the sauce was so good I wanted to spoon the rest of little bowl of it like soup. The Japanese Lasagna was also AMAZING! Warm and perfect. My sister and I had about 7/8 rolls, 2 orders of that garlic edamane, and miso soup, total damage: $41 and change and we were stuffed to the gills! Our server was very attentive and answered all of my silly questions (and trust me, I have a lot of them). This particular night they had a lot of fresh seafood options, the board read: O'Toro, Blu fin Tuna from Spain, Nodokuro, Sayori, Live Uni, Scallos, Octopus Legs, Abalone, and Lobster. They have a variety of non-sushi dishes from a variety of Asian cultures. The place is small, but has a family like feel.This may be the best sushi I've ever had in Vegas and that's a huge statement because I am super, duper picky. Well done, Yummy Grill. Can't wait to go back!Best. Sushi. Ever.So simple. Given, I'm an amateurish sushi eater, but this is some of the best fish I've ever been served. The ahi, hamachi and salmon sashimi are slices of buttery goodness. On both trips here I've ordered twice, bc I just needed more. The service is quick and attentive, and I hear that Chef Eric is the man, though I haven't officially said hello to him yet :-X Know a true sushi beginner? Bring them here. They will be sold! Are you a sushi pro? Come here for some of the freshest fish in the desert.This is not the place to get rolls. Discovered that the hard way, despite reading so many reviews here that focused on the fresh nigiri and sashimi. I'll have to come back for the positive experience.Ordered take out using their website menu: seaweed salad, cherry blossom roll, paradise roll. Didn't see many rolls with salmon, and many contained tempura. Made my selection difficult, but they get a lot of reviews praising their rolls, so I figured I was safe.Inside of restaurant is kind of divey with a large bar, which I like. Service was polite and friendly from the ladies at the counter. Three sushi chefs were present and busy when I was picking up.Got home to the messy cherry blossom roll. Confession: I love sushi, but I've never had a round roll like this. Verdict: not my thing. Too reminiscent of crab salad and avocado from a country club or buffet, little to no similarity to sushi. Wish this had been noted more clearly on the menu. Or at all.t was the Paradise roll, which sounded adventurous. In my haste to find a roll with salmon, I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the fact that there was tempura shrimp AND (way too much) cream cheese AND (sweet) coconut in this roll. Verdict: again, not my thing. Very sweet and creamy roll, bearing little to no similarity to sushi. The sweetness and the cheese covered up any fish taste.Seaweed salad was flavored appropriately but dismally small: whoever packed my order accidentally put the salad in the lid rather than the bottom of the container, and space was limited.Disappointed to have a negative experience at a place so many friends and Elites love and have reviewed favorably.  Overall, the rolls themselves are TOO Americanized, to the point that proportions of flavors are off and they're no longer sushi. I'll have to revisit and order exclusively off the fresh sashimi and nigiri specials next time for a separate review.BEST OMAKASE EVER ! Thanks to Chef Eric for accommodating us for so long (oh my god it took FOUR AND A HALF HOURS) ! ! ! First and BEST omakase experience ! Omakase is a show in itself. Watching Chef Eric work his magic and show his creativity in his dishes. max points on service ! Fresh Wasabi - made into a relish. Addicting! went well with a lot of dishes but also yummy to "snack" on while waiting in between dishes. produces a fast effect to the nasal passages. has a nice, sweet flavor. #1 - Marinated Tuna on top of chopped Mountain Yam with Wasabi TobikoSaw Chef Eric chopping mountain yam. After chopping, the yam produced a "slimy" texture, similar to okra but crunchy like jicama. Yam itself was plain but paired with a marinated tuna balanced flavors very well. what a variety of textures#2 - Deep Fried Gobo/Burdock Root with dipping sauceLittle chips. Fried perfectly. Very slight starchy texture but crispy overall. Lightly sweet. Great "snack" ! #3 - Fresh Santa Barbara Sea Conch with salt/pepper/sesame oil dipping sauceVery fresh. Meat texture had a nice "bite" texture. LIGHTLY dipping the sliced conch in the sauce gives it a nice flavor. Salt helps brings out more sweetness of the conch meat#4 - Fresh Hama Hama & Shigoku OystersOne of my fears on eating raw oysters is they being not fresh, and not clean (resulting in biting into sand/shell/etc.) Two different sizes. Shigoku oysters were small and fat. Very clean and fresh. Gave a nice, creamy texture. Hama Hama oysters were much bigger, not as "fat/thick". Outer "rim" of the oyster, gave it a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture when eating. #5 - Fresh Live Scallop w/ Dried MisoServed two ways. The scallop itself was thinly sliced and sprinkled with dried miso and layered with slices of cucumber. The miso gave it a nice flavor on top of the fresh taste of the scallop. The muscle? was sliced and placed in the middle. Not chewy but gave a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture, similar to what you'd get from eating fresh geoduck sashimi #6 - Takoyaki - Deep Fried Fresh Octopus Suction CupsAt first, i thought this was calamari. But was told it was the SUCTION CUPS of an octopus leg. Lightly battered and deep fried. Crispy batter. Suction cups itself was nice and "crispy" #7 - Fresh Live Hokkaido Octopus LegThis was definitely a surprise. Aside it from having a small spot of sriracha sauce on top that gave it a little kick... i did NOT expect the octopus to be so soft and tender. Granted i dont think i've had raw octopus, especially served like this but oh man ! #8 - Fresh Live Sweet Shrimp with Black Tobiko and Uni + Deep Fried HeadThe head was deep fried. Fried pretty well. Most of it was edible, except some thicker, harder areas. The sweet shrimp itself was big. Meat texture was firm. Slightly naturally sweet. #9 - Fresh Live Santa Barbara Sea Urchin topped with a raw Quail Egg & Ikura on a bed of mixed seaweed brown riceLARGE & FAT (no joke !) pieces of sea urchin placed on top of the bed of mixed seaweed with brown rice (and other things) with a raw quail egg on top with some Ikura. The sea urchin was SUPER creamy. Mixing in the quail egg and ikura. Taking a small piece of the sea urchin and everything else. What a orchestra of flavors and textures. so delicious ! add a little fresh wasabi for even better experience !  i think this is less than $20 ala carte too ! what a deal, even normally ! #10 - Fresh Blue Fin Tuna/Chu-Toro/O-toro from Spain Nigiri Trio Made into nigiri. Chef used his special homemade soy sauce on the tuna as well ! Best blue fin tuna i've ever eaten. Very slight metallic taste. Super tender and flavorful. Chu-toro was a perfect balance of meat and fat. Melts in your mouth. O-toro (was a little disappointing due to the pieces of chewy parts (tendons?) which req' the chef to slice and arrange it differently). Super fatty. Would have liked the chef to quickly torch the top to bring out the aroma and flavor of the fat even more. #11 - Fresh Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna with Fried OnionsSliced tuna. Add a few onions to the middle, on top of the sliced chili, wrap it around and enjoy. plethora of flavors on top of the nice sauce it was sitting in. Chili adds a little small kick to it all#12 - Torch Seared Wagyu Beef with Uni, Ikura, and chopped ShallotsSuper tender! Roll it around to "encase" the uni and ikura. Opposite side of beef still raw. variation of beef tataki. #13 - Fresh Kohada (Spotted Sardine) First time trying kohada ! always wanted to try ! strong flavor with a little sourness (similar to mackerel) #14 - Fresh Australian Ocean Trout and New Zealand King SalmonTrout tastes crisper, less fatty than salmon. Both orange meat. Simple and clean. #15 - Fresh Blue Fin O-Toro SashimiTHAT MARBLING ! Super tender. A5 Wagyu of the Sea. #16 - Unagi topped with avocado and bonito flakesSimple but delicious unagi nigiri#17 - Green Tea Ice Cream1st floral tasting and aromatic green tea EVERWith the high reviews I really wanted to love this place. I did and I kept coming back hoping things would change with the customer service and wait time for food but it never did. See the end of my review for why. The first time we came for happy hour and got huge slices of fish, very generous. We then went back again and this time the fish slices were literally cut in half the size it was the first time, service was sllllllooooowww and we had to ask for them to check on things, ask for water refills, but my main gripe was that the fish slice reduced in half. I would appreciate them keeping things fairly consistent if it's large slices or small, either way I know what I would get. I do like the quality of the fish and so I would always try to convince my hubby to come back and each time I literally had to convince my husband that things would get better in terms of the wait time for food. Sometimes we just don't have 2 1/2 -3 hours to wait for our food. We came here once on a major holiday and once on my birthday so that shows you how much I really liked their fish but I started to feel like I was just being hopeful by keep coming back, hoping things would get better. We also came about 5 other times. The last visit was my most memorable in a bad way. We ordered tuna (regular) on the first order and had a conversation with our waitress and she told us how blue fin tuna was much better and we should get it. We said we would think about it. She said if you order all of our different types of tunas and have them side by side and compare taste you would notice the difference. We then later added in blue fin tuna (with a different waitress because ours was too busy to talk to us for about the 10 minutes we tried flagging her down). The regular tuna arrived at the table. We were hoping to get them together but after waiting and waiting we never got the blue fin, so we just ate that first tuna (regular).  More waiting and waiting and got some other orders, we got another plate of tuna. It looked exactly the same as the first. But what do we know, maybe it was different.  It tasted the same as the first. We were confused. We asked our waitress why it tasted exactly the same (when she claimed they tasted different) and she went to go check on it and after some long conversations with the sushi chef and waitresses she came back and said that I had ordered another order of regular tuna. I said no we ordered the blue fin tuna per your suggestion. We weren't impressed with the regular tuna and that is why we ordered the blue fin. She kept insisting that I ordered the regular and I kept insisting I did not, because that is true. This went on with her talking about it with Eric the sushi chef/Owner? and the 2 waitresses involved. It started to get uncomfortable for me watching it all. She then comes back and says if you want to order it, it's past the happy hour time but we can offer it at the happy hour price. Ummmm, no thanks. I already ordered it before (an hour ago), we are done eating, already spent over $100, and so over it at this point. Why not just bring us the correct tuna that I ordered??? Especially since they know us by face, Eric even came over and said he recognized us when I mentioned that we have been here many times. It just upset me that they made such a BIG deal about it, instead of just giving me what I ordered, the waitress insisted I was WRONG and made it known, making for a really awkward "date night" with my husband. It was also the waitress that kept saying there is nothing she can do, it's not her restaurant and she is sorry but that is the decision. She kept apologizing for what happened, but like I said we were done eating and just ready to go, not wanting to argue over fish. The owner could see us talking and he finally came over long after we had already been talking about this for an extended period of time which I just wanted wanted to drop it at this point. I expect more from a place with high reviews and wish he would have taken the matter into his hands from the start once he realized there was a problem. In the end he removed the second order of regular tuna and made it seem like he was accommodating us. It was the right thing to do, but we still never got the blue fin tuna we ordered. To each his own and he is the owner, if he feels this is how to treat regular customers, that is his choice. Unfortunately after coming here regularly for about a year, we decided that we want to feel a little more appreciated as customers. I think the problem could have been fixed quickly even if the waitress did not admit it was her fault instead of dragging it out and making for an uncomfortable dining out experience. The fish is 4 stars (5 stars taste, 4 stars size of nigiri). The customer service to me is 0 stars.Came in for happy hour yesterday with a friend and wow! Items ordered:-Cucumber salad; soy sauce & sesame seeds ($2.50)-Baked California roll; crab, avocado, yum yum sauce ($3) -Japanese Lasagna Roll; crab, cream cheese, avocado, yum yum & eel sauce ($4.50)I wasn't very hungry since I had already eaten, but since I had never tried Yummy's, I figured I could make a little bit of room in my belly. The cucumber salad had a different taste than what I'm used to but it was still good, the salad does not come with crab automatically, you have to ask for some, so I will remember that for next time. There is an additional charge ($5) for crab or shrimp, whichever you'd prefer. The rolls were both very good. I'm also not really a fan of baked rolls but these were good, specially the Japanese lasagna. I'm not really a big fan of having cream cheese in rolls since most places tend to make the cream cheese taste too overpowering, but not here, the balance was perfect! The restaurant itself is on the small side, but not uncomfortable small. The waiters were all very nice and friendly. Service was quick, we were in and out in 30 minutes. Now I wish they were closer to me, but the drive from the southwest side of town wasn't too bad.OBSESSED OBSESSED!Sorry but I'm obsessed and the experience here just keeps on getting better and better...  the fact that they remeber me through yelp is even more of a graditude and SERVICE seriously can't express it enough on how much they wow me.I always go only to have a little taster of stuff but it's so good that I just can't stop eating... always go in telling myself I will only get a few things! But I lie to myself every time!PEOPLE!! I don't mean to hype this place up so much but seriously got to give them a try! Better than anything you could get on the strip I would have to say... But i ALWAYS try a new place with no expectations... so if you do go in try everything that sounds good to you!I know this joint has a ton of reviews, but after dining here so many times over the last few years, they deserve another 5 stars. This place is the best up North. THE BEST! We love us some good sushi and there are quite a few places to go to in town. If you're up in the NW corner, try this place out.It's great for lunch, dinner and late night. We come here pretty regularly when we want sushi and it has yet to disappoint us. They want their customers to know that they have fresh fish flown in 3 times a week and more if needed. They even bring out eel, fish and whatever to show the clients how fresh their meal is going to be. Honestly, I could do without. But it's still pretty cool for some people, I suppose. We LOVE getting the Kobe roll here. That's very American, but good god...it's amazing. Also, the yellowtail here is always amazing. Everything we've had there, we've loved. The service is always great and the sushi chefs are super friendly and always very helpful. If you give them an idea of what you like, they're always happy to make a creation for you. LOVE this place!HH is awesome for those who enjoy fresh nigiri and a tastefully dressed salad like myself. Couldn't think of much else I'd want on the HH menu so I had them make me a specialty roll which included salmon, eel, shrimp tempura, cream cheese And avocado (all of my favorite things ) I'm coming back for HH for sure!
Sing High Chop Suey House=I was so pumped to check this place out after I found it by complete accident. I read up on it and was really intrigued by the history behind the place and how this might be one of the oldest restaurants in Phoenix (they must be doing something right, yeah?) as well as being the only thing standing from the city's historic Chinatown. But, seriously, this place did not live up to anything to any of my expectations.Now I know some might argue that this place serves American Chinese cuisine, and that's true. However, this is some of the nastiest Chinese food I've ever had. Some might complain about the decor, but I actually kinda liked it. I felt like I was in a Jarmusch movie so I'll give the place some points for that. As much as I'm into dives, this is a little bit higher than a place I ate called Won Kok which I am convinced is the butthole of Los Angeles' Chinatown. To be honest, all I that had at Sing High was the chow mein and the wonton soup. The wonton soup was just old cabbage boiled in water and the chow mein was just a plate of oily noodles. Needless to say, I felt like I was giving birth to the Antichrist a few hours later.Go to Sing High for the experience of saying you were there, but keep your mouth closed at all costs.If you happen to come across this little hole in the wall. The thought might pop into your head that this will be one of those great hidden gems. Well let me tell you know. Its not.According to my mother it used to be amazing a decade ago. But no longer. To be fair the gigantic hole in the ceiling right before you enter should have been our first clue. But it was almost 6pm and I hadn't eaten all day. Not to mention I've eaten amazing food in way shadier places. So we went in. The place is roomy, lots of parking and places to sit. But the decor mixed with the soft jazz they play is reminiscent of an old school gangster film. I spent my whole meal waiting for Sollozzo and McCluskey to meet their end.As for the food. I was shocked there was so little vegeterian friendly options. Which lead me to order an awkward looking plate of vegetables and chow mein. What it really was a can of hard noodles under a mix of onions and bean sprouts. With a mystery flavorless white sauce drenched through out. My not vegeterian associate got the sweet and sour shrimp. Which was ridiculously over battered. I was so hungry and disatiasfied with my meal I found myself eating her leftover batter. Which still had a bit of sweet and sour sauce on it. The sauce was probably the only redeeming factor food wise. We did have a nice and fast waitress.Long story short, I ate a grilled cheese when I got home.
Riccio's Italian Restaurant=So happy to have Riccio's in the Touchstone neighborhood. You know the movies or TV shows with the local pizza joint that families always go to after soccer games or church? Enter Riccio's. It may be a little hard to locate in the corner of the shopping center off of Baybrook, but once you find it, it's easy to tell it's a gem. A quaint interior with tables and booths and plenty of smiling faces. My wife and I stumbled in to pick up a pizza and garlic knots. The service was so fast! Ready in less than 15 minutes!Let me take this opportunity to blow your mind. Eggplant Parmesan pizza. Yes. Commence drooling. Fried eggplant, marinara and gratuitous amounts of mozz on a pizza. Holy cow. Amazing. Chewy eggplant with a light layer of seasoned breading. The garlic knots were the best I've had to date. Not coated in grease like so many other places. Dusted with garlic powder and finishes with a welcoming chew. The dough is wonderful. Great for sopping up extra marinara!So happy to have finally visited Riccio's! Can't wait to head back to our new little neighborhood pizza place!I have known for quite a while that Riccios was tucked away in the Touchstone shopping center  (along with Tuesday Morning and the Touchstone Yellow Rose) but haven't bothered going before now because I thought it was just another super casual pizza joint. So, when we saw the recent Groupon deal, we decided to go and check it out.  Needless to say, we were suprised when we walked in the door last Friday night and found the place jam-packed with people.  It was standing room only! However, Ricky found a spot for us to have a seat on some barstools back by the kitchen while we waited .  We waited no more than 5 -10 minutes and then were taken to our table.We decided to start with an order of calamari and garlic knots.  The calamari was breaded and cooked just right - not rubbery or chewy. The marinara sauce was fresh and tasty.  The garlic knots were seasoned to perfection and quite tasty.  Our server was very helpful in answering our questions about various menu items. It was a tough decision though because they had a nice selection of pastas, pizzas, and entree favs like chicken parm, chicken marsala, eggplant parm, etc.I was really torn between the vegetable lasagna and the Tortolloni Bellagio.  I ended up with the tortelloni which was served in a cream sauce with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, and chicken (around $15).  It was very good, but rather rich, so next time I think I'll check out the veggie lasagna or one of the pizzas.  (I saw several other tables with pizzas that looked really good.) Other people in my party ordered veal marsala (around $18), chicken parm (around $16), and chicken francaise (around $16).  I thought the chicken parm & chicken francaise (similar to chicken piccata) both looked good. Since I don't eat veal, I thought that dish looked icky. ;-)  One of our friends had a birthday so we ordered a dessert to share and of course, had to go with the tiramisu. It was good - perfect texture and flavor. Overall, I was pleasantly suprised about our entire experience here. The food was good, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was friendly & comfy.  We ended up spending a little more than expected we would (the bill came to around $100 before tip for 4 entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert, and 3 beers) but the place was still reasonably priced.  We are definitely looking forward to our next visit.Ricky came by to chat with us and we found out this is the same Riccios that was originally in Myers Park (started by Ricky's family) and then was over at Strawberry Hill for a while.  Long time Charlotteans may remember Riccios from one of the previous locations.  In any case, we hope they stay in this location for a long, long time!  Oh, and as a bonus, we found out they deliver to our neighborhood, so SCORE for those nights when we're too lazy to cook or go out!Riccio's has been a tradition for my husband and I for as long as we have been together (almost 10 years). When Touchstone Village used to have a Food Lion in it, and a video store, he lived in the neighborhood behind it, and would walk from his house. Cue his current best friend that moved in 2 doors down when he was 7 and they would ride their bikes up there every weekend. Needless to say, our group of 4 is recognized when we come in. I know the original two waitresses have literally watched my husband and his friend grow up, and consistently order the same thing (garlic knots, house salads, and pizza). Even now we still order the same garlic knots, salad, and pizza, albeit our group is a bit larger. The food has never disappointed. The salads are always "the best house salads" ever, and the pizza is always fresh from the oven in less than 15 minutes even with a packed house. Although with recent renovations, the place has grown, and had a face lift this is still the family restaurant we have known and loved for years. You are always greeted with a smile, the owner will always be there and converse with every table, and you will always leave full and satisfied.
The Tap House=I am rarely voluntarily away from Vegas for long. Sure there are those times that the state wishes I occupy one of their rooms for 3 to 6 years, but we have all had those times.  I came back for my birthday and I visited many of my old haunts. I was longing for nostalgia. I was longing for strong drink. I was longing for weak companionship. I hit many of my favorite places...and the Tap House was one of them.I longed to play shuffleboard, drink beers and listen to good music. When I am near Summerlin there is only one place I go to. So I swung into the bar around midnight and spend the rest of the night throwing back drinks with friends. The pizza was half price and that was just right for us. We tried three of the pizzas and they were amazing. I also had to order my favorite Chicken Parmigiana. It was as wonderful as usual. Right next door used to be a Las Vegas institution called Fellini's.  They have since moved their restaurant to the Sun Coast Casino to ply their trade. The good news is that they still deliver their freshly made sauces and they are amazing as always.  So you basically get to eat the same food for half the price and get reasonable priced drinks.The bartender knew it was my birthday and comped me drinks and was totally cool. He treated Rex like the way Rex demands to be treated. It is important to treat Rex well...and he knew that. He could see it in the eyes.I want to address the smoking issue one person brought up...and I will say...grow up!  People smoke in bars...but very rarely do they get to smoke in a place with a great shuffleboard table and amazing food.I have removed one star because they have a crappy jukebox that plays edited songs. Ridiculous. Good music on there but not all the songs you would want. Go. Go often. Drink. Drink to Rex. You always should.I rarely make it up to this side of town but my husband and I were headed to Plant World and needed to have some lunch before we got our shopping started. From the outside, The Tap House isn't anything exceptional but over the years I have learned that sometimes these dive looking places serve up great food at really reasonable prices. Little did we know that pizzas were half off on Saturdays until we were already seated and trying to decide if we should get one to split, or order separately.  It was like fate, how could we decide on anything else when the pizza was half priced? We ended up with the thin-crust veggie pizza, with olives on only half, plus banana peppers. We also split an antipasto salad.To drink, had a jager bomb, which was just $4.50, and I had the option of regular or sugar free Red Bull. In a town where some places charge $5 or more for just a Red Bull, this is a great deal. Great deals mean nothing if the food sucks. This food did not suck. The antipasto salad was good sized with plenty of meat, and the pizza was cooked perfectly and loaded with toppings. If I lived in the area, I could see myself going to The Tap House often for dinner or just drinks.THAT was a fantastic pizza!!! $12 for a large "Fellini" topped with sausage, mushrooms, salami, peppers and olives definitely hit the spot.  All the pizzas are done in a pan which made the Fellini taste like a homemade Pizza Hut supreme.  I haven't been to another spot in LV that does it quite like this and it'll be the best reason to come back.There were definitely some minuses like the smokiness and I felt like the whole area was lacking sufficient lighting.  So if you're trying to lay low and avoid people that may be looking for you (manhunts, warrants, ex-spouses, Rent A Center)) this place will do the trick....unless they happen to be a Cleveland Browns fan.  I think this is one of two Browns bars in Vegas.  So when are they erecting the Brian Hoyer statue upfront? (Edit: Hoyer tore his ACL a week after this review ending his season) Speaking of football, we were there catching the second half of the Monday night game (Broncos vs Raiders) when music started kicking in from the other room.  Their "Monday Nites Jamming" was rocking.  The whole room on the other side was packed with people by 8pm partying like it was 1979.  I was impressed.  They also offer daily specials like burger and a beer Mondays but it's got to be all about their pizza!!  Half price pizzas all day Saturdays/Sundays and after midnight!
Fenwick's Restaurant=Holy tap-dancing Christo!  This place is, "Is that a solar system in your restaurant? Because your food is out of this world good."  To preface, I went into this day a little tired and completely unaware of what was going to happen.  A friend recommended we mix up our normal Sunday routine of the Flying Biscuit and try out Fenwick's.... Which most people had never heard of - but this guy is cute and has great taste so sure, we were on board.  I've probably driven by this restaurant well over 50 times and never thought anything of it.  It's kind of like the girl next store... adorable and unassuming, but then you get one taste and boom! You're hooked.  Let's start by saying that we had a group of 16 people and this place probably seats 25-30 MAX.  We walked in without any reservations or heads up and they were all smiles and let us rearrange their restaurant at our leisure.  Some customers even moved seats to make more room - amazing.  From the moment we sat down service was attentive and friendly and constantly throughout the meal our group kept saying "I feel like they care about me" or "I feel like I'm at home."  What better compliment can you give?But here's the cincher - the FOOD.  There were about 6 specials that our waitress told us about - all of them which made me drool.   I had to go with the (WAIT FOR IT)......... Nutella stuffed, Captain Crunch rolled, Brioche covered in chocolate and bananas.  WHAT!?  Somebody pinch me, did she say Captain Crunch AND Nutella?!  So that was an obvious hit...over the fence world series kind of thing.  But out of the 16 people in our group everyone got a pretty varied menu: omelets, quiche, benedict, breakfast specials, caramel apple pancakes, banana foster pancakes, grits, etc.   Group consensus?  Absolutely 100% yes I would do that again and pay twice the price it was so good.So overall, you should probably stop whatever you're doing, quit your job and see if you can live in Fenwick's.  Top 5 places in Charlotte.  My 2013 challenge?  Try everything on Fenwick's menu.  Amen to this place, Love at first taste.Fenwick's is celebrating their 30th Anniversary! Congrats! This cozy family operated restaurant is conveniently located on the 500 block of Providence Road . The brunch here is very popular and there are always daily specials on the menu board!Recently I got to sample their menu with some friends.For appetizers, the hummus and onion rings are good, but the wings are best. Just the perfect crunch on the outside and tender inside, covered in a flavorful, killer sauce.All of the entrees were delicious. The Salmon Filet portion on the salad was enormous! The standouts were definitely the London Broil plate and the Chicken Breast covered in creamy, cheesy goodness.The best part was hands down the desserts! Whoa! Probably the best Key Lime pie I've ever had! The VCR, a vanilla custard with raspberry sauce and fresh strawberries was pretty amazing too!
Church Brew Works=How much fun is this place?!?  I'll tell you.  It's loads of fun.  First things first: a big thank you to Pitt Yelper Kat M. for suggesting husband and I come here on our trip to the 'Burgh.  You were right, we loved Church Brew Works!If you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.]For two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.  Our brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.  Aaaaa-men.This restaurant ruined my New Year's Eve! My husband and I made a reservation for 10pm, thinking it would be a fun place to be at midnight - we were wrong. We were told we had the table for 2 hours, and there were all sorts of rules about how you couldn't cancel or be late or else they'd charge you. We were a few minutes early, and pretty much the first thing our server said to us when we sat down was, "Our kitchen is about to close." Why they take reservations for 10pm if that's when the kitchen closes, I can't imagine. So, we quickly put in our order (we both wanted their special New Year's Eve 3 course prix fixe menu), and continued to be rushed through the entire meal. The appetizer was disappointing - my husband ordered Fried Goat Cheese and the portion was so teeny tiny; the cheese pieces were about the size of a dime. I had the Cioppino, which was supposed to be mussels, scallops, and shrimp in a lobster-saffron broth. There was no shrimp, and the mussels and scallops were so miniature that they had no flavor whatsoever. The broth and garlic bread were good.While we were still eating our appetizers they brought out the soup/salad course, which is so rude and made us feel rushed. My husband's Lobster Bisque was good, but again, very small portion. I had the Roasted Cauliflower Salad, which turned out to be an arugula salad, garnished with a few small shavings of cauliflower.Again, while we were still eating our soup/salad, they brought out our entree, and by that time we were pretty annoyed and asked if they could keep the entrees hot while we finished our current course. Our server was visibly impatient/annoyed and said that her manager didn't want our entrees in the window, but agreed to bring them back anyway. When we were finished and she brought our entrees back out they were lukewarm. The flavors were good, but would have been much better if prepared/served at the appropriate time.Then we asked to see the dessert menu and our server said no, the kitchen is closed. We asked to speak to the manager. Miraculously, the kitchen was not actually closed. We had dessert - my Malted Bread Pudding was good, but my husband's Carrot Cake was way too gingery.Through each course, the staff was cleaning around us, making us feel even more rushed, and we couldn't even have a normal conversation because they were hovering so much. Our server was acting like she couldn't wait for us to leave.When we were finished and it was time to pay, the manager finally came out. He glazed over the whole issue and did not listen to our complaints. By that time we felt so unwelcomed, we just wanted to get out of there. So, we were actually driving home when the clock struck midnight. So disappointing!I don't know how this place would be on a regular night, but I definitely would stay away from it on any sort of special occasion. I am just shocked by how unprofessional they were on every level.Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.   I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers) After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.Oh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.   First and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.   There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business.
Isabela On Grandview=Isabella's is a diva well past her prime.  When you're driving up to a restaurant and there's a ten-foot-long banner on the side that says, "Pittsburgh's Most Romantic Restaurant 2010," you know you're in trouble (nothing says romantic quite like a giant sign that says, "Romantic"). It's true the view of downtown PGH is sweeping, but the dining room felt like it was a set from the movie Network or American Psycho: time has not been kind to classy 80's interior design.Okay, the service. When our waitress first came over she asked if we wanted to hear "the restaurant's story." My dining companion had already been there and I honestly wasn't that interested. After saying we were good on the story she said, "Well, let me tell you anyway."And that she did; it was long-winded (the chefs cooked other places, they now cook here, etc.) and pretty boring. Throughout the rest of the meal we had to ask for water refills repeatedly and she didn't clear empty plates for ten minutes. However, she did manage to do a fancy fold on my companion's napkin the second he went to the bathroom. Whatever you do, don't let the napkin rest on the chair for even a moment! I don't know, it was like she took a Saturday morning high-end service class but got high right beforehand.Whoever conceived the menu at Isabela's knew what they were doing, but whoever they entrusted to execute it doesn't. The prix fixe menu is 7 courses ($70 per person) and you definitely get your money's worth if you're measuring in quantity: both of us were stuffed by the end of the meal. But if you're measuring by quality of food I'd say no. The shrimp soup was just a failure (the base was waaaayyyy too tangy to make sense), the steak and potatoes were doable and the ricotta cheese cake had oddly squishy bits of almonds crunch in it. The squid and octopus entree was creamy and remarkably delicious.If you find yourself here on a first date (as I did), or worse, if someone you've been with for any significant amount of time thinks you should spend your anniversary here, be sure to split a bottle of wine: it'll put a warm gloss on things.
Roberto's Authentic Mexican Food=Everyone I know around here eats at Roberto's, they deliver and it is prob the best Mexican fast food in the near vicinity other than my Mom's cooking of course! Now I dont eat meat so when they can accommodate me with w/e the effffff I want and however picky my high maintenance self can get, well they get kudos in my book! They make a mean Chile Relleno Burro you can put w/e you want in it crema, pico, rice, beans they will customize it for you no prob. This is my fav relleno place on this side of town period! Dont forget the Horchata!We live in the general area and have been here several times before and after the DDD show. They always have good food. Always. We had 3x bean and cheese burritos, 1x shredded beef taco and 1x chili releno ,meal with rice and beans. I could only eat one chili and some rice and beans. That thing was good. The burritos an d taco were devoured by the rest of the family with hardly any speaking. That is a feat in my house. (3 girls) I heart Robertos.
Comet Grill=Omit the U and we finally have Charlotte's first O(fficial) YE. Yeah buddy! Some say eclectic, but I prefer eccentric (like me!). Comet Grill really embodies what a neighborhood dive should be. It's the type of bar that established the counterculture which made dive bars hip and trendy. This is the type of place where the locals run, and not because it's the talk of the town, but because it's real, original, and unique. There is nothing superficial about it; no glamor or glitz here. It's just a great place to enjoy drinks and food with good company. I didn't grab any food, but the rumor is, everything is tasty. Everything is made in house, so you know there must be some love attached to it. As others mentioned, AC is incredibly underrated. It wasn't a packed house, but still insanely hot. "Heat rises" so avoid the second story in the summer months. I debated on 3 or 4 stars because of the heat index, and while 3.5 is more deserving.....eff it. The bartender was really nice and walked the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail up and down the stairs for us. Now you heard it before, but I'll say it again. $1 PBRs on Thursdays. That's cheaper than bottled water!Local, local, local. Great little bar with good food and cold brews. It's a small place but with lots of character. I've been here a few times for lunch. The Reuben is fantastic, so are their hot dogs. Haven't tried the burgers yet. Friendly place with lots of local regulars located on Park Rd in the Dilworth area. It's worth a stop.
Red Rocks Cafe Bar & Bakery=Can't say that I've been jonesin' to check out RR. Sure, it's a convenient location and easy lunchtime middle-ground for different professions. You can see the "ladies who lunch" crowd here or even the dude in his power suit ready to "rock" a deal with a client. Can't say you'll see too much wowing going on from the food perspective. I came here for lunch with a friend since it was the most convenient location for both of us. Ended up ordering a salad with rare, seared tuna and the light balsamic dressing. I've been on a kick of lighter lunch options lately and Red Rocks' salad options fit the bill rather well. Our server was....friendly, but seemed a little perturbed when we presented a coupon. Not a huge deal, but just something to keep in mind. Would I go back? Sure. Am I rushing back to excavate the rest of the menu for something worthwhile? Nope.
Barro's Pizza=The interactions of office workers are a model for society at large; well-meaning, well-mannered individuals combine to form mindless, tactless mobs. This goes double for the IT business, where college-educated scholars emerge from their offices to congregate in basement computer labs to reclaim their primal triviality. Passive aggressive intellectuals become territorial Luddites; arguments erupt over whose iPod is played over the speakers, whether to lift tables or drag them across the carpet, and whether or not making fun of my toe nail polish counted as gender discrimination.When it came time for lunch, a caucus of Neanderthal-like rumbling came from our throats. Moments ago, we had all been connoisseurs of fine cuisine. But suddenly we clamored for culture-less layman food. Burgers. Subs. No. Pizza. PIZZA! PIZZA! WE WANT PIZZA! ORDER THE PIZZA GODDAMIT!"Well, what pizza should we get?"Pizza by Napoli. No, I don't like their crusts. Well, how about Pullano's? No. Too greasy. My sensitive tummy can't handle it. "How about Barro's?"What is this 'Barro's"? Is it deep dish? Is it New York Style? "I really like it."Well fine. But what should we put on it? Sausage. No. Extra cheese, I'm a vegetarian. No. Pineapple. Nobody likes pineapple, shut up. Pepperoni. Yes. Pepperoni. PEPPERONI!A half hour later...I like this Barro's, don't you? Yes. It's deep dish, but it's crispy. The crust is just the right amount of thickness. The toppings are generous, and there is plenty of cheese. Just good and bland enough to reach the status quo. We all approve. Hooray Barro's! This was a good lunch! Good job, whoever suggested this?As soon as lunch was over, someone was hit in the face with a chair. Your tax dollars at work.Many people don't know it, but even though Barro's is a chain you'll see in various locations, it's a LOCAL chain, family owned and operated.They established here in Phoenix circa 1984 (i think it was) and have grown and expanded all over AZ quite successfully ever since.The best pizza in town, even if service is a little inconsistent.
Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill=Holy happy hour specials, Batman!Bookmarked this place for their HH: 4-6PM, half off tapas and $2 off wine or beer.Restaurant interior is more upscale than I expected.Menu is fairly diverse with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options indicated with symbols. Tapas menu has several Mediterranean options, there are a bunch of salads, and of course, there's pizza- if you join their mailing list, you'll get a coupon to try a pizza for free (dine in only, with purchase).BF and I were here for a light early dinner, got 3 tapas and a beer.FIG & GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD: Yum, 4-slice portion with good balance of flavors from the sweet figs, salty cheese, and mild spinach, as well as a bit of pork? Adding a sprinkle of red pepper kicked it up a notch.PARMESAN STUFFED ARTICHOKES: Good lord these were the table favorite, served in a blanket of parmesan crumbs with a cup of dipping sauce. 'Chokes had crunch and flavor, herb coating was light and complemented the cheese inside, which was mild instead of overpowering (as done elsewhere).DUCK MINI TACOS: An order of 6 mini tacos, filled with 24-hour-marinated duck topped with cilantro, tomatoes, feta, and sour cream, HH pricing at just over $5? Amazeballs. I never would have combined duck and feta, but I love them both and here everything worked so well together in this dish. Fresh and flavorful!Only thing that detracted from my visit was the service: entered and stood by hostess stand for quite a while before being acknowledged, and our server had way too many tables to herself and was quite frazzled. This was frustrating because there were easily 8 employees present, but I guess maybe they weren't on the clock yet? As 6 o'clock got closer, business picked up and the three women mobbing the hostess stand eventually started picking up the slack.Normally I'd dock a star for this, but despite being overwhelmed our server was polite and our food came out quickly, and was amazing.Fabulous food, phenomenal happy hour.  Even with a beer, total before tip was under $20. Will be coming back to try more!
Mi Patio=Mi Patio es su patio. While there actually is not a patio at Mi Patio there is standard Mexican fare (with a little Greek flare I might add) that is a step up from other local Mexican restaurants. My Chef took me there (I mean, he's a chef, the place is bound to rock my guacamole) and they seemed to know him. Lovin' the "Norm!" a la Cheers kinda thing when I go out with John. Interior was brightly lit, not a piece of black wraught iron in sight. Colorful parrots hang from the ceiling. Oh, did I say they're not real. Clay I believe. Anyway the food. That's why we're here. I had such a hankering for Huevos Rancheros I couldn't pass it up. Served with a chunky ranchera sauce over two corn tortillas along with some fantastic beans and passable rice, I was a happy Tomasito. Homemade flour tortillas are served along with the meal and they were dee lish. John had a combo plate with an enchilada in a savory and medium spiced red sauce with a serving a skirt steak. I thought that was cool. A combo plate where you can get a piece o meat. The guacamole, chips and salsa were all on my A list.I will tell you exactly why this place is so great.This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.  Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle.Say "Nah" Like the famous sunglasses kid, "Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot."  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (He's a Chump.  "You sir, command that fish into this taco."). Short list of amazing things to be had here:1. Margaritas.2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it?3. The Chips and Salsa 4. Chicken Tacos.  5.  Ice Tea. 6. PacificoI have a simple life, big and small, soft and crispy, full of obvious contradictions and some surprising incarnations. The life of a tortilla is much like anyone else full of glamour, large family drama and constant transformation. I'd like to share that story with you here today, my life as a tortilla.Ever since being a young kernel of corn I've know I was different from the rest of the ear. While the other kernels longed to be cereal and ethanol, I knew that I wanted to be a star. Celebrated each and every day, giving promise of a brighter and tastier future. Then it happened, I was suddenly plucked, mashed, rolled and pressed, being transformed from the ugly duckling into the beautiful swan I always knew I was. Destined for greatness in the kitchen of Mi Patio, I knew it was all coming true for I am the corn tortilla.From the second you walk in the door of my home, you can sense my presence. Bold colors, comfortable seating and smiling faces were all there to celebrate my life and times. As soon as you are seated a hot, lightly salty and crispy bowl of me is sat onto the table. They've cut me into triangles so I'm easier to handle, then I'm deep-fried golden and simply beautiful. My 2 friends, Mild and Spicy, are a couple of salsas that love to hang out all over me. Go ahead, grab me and dip me deep into one of them, slather me in their tomato goodness, I deserve it as much as you do. I have another friend, the cold and refreshing Margarita ($1.75), who simply completes me. Enjoy them slowly while the wandering minstrels play requests from my motherland of Mexico, this would bring a joyful tear to me eye, if I had one.On the menu you can find many of my brothers, sisters and cousins. My cousin Quesapilla ($6.35) is a real show off though his beginnings are quite humble. Some also call him native fry bread but I just call him a crowd pleasure. Stuffed with gobs of cheese and griddled until melted and bubbly, he tastes just as good as he looks. Spoon on some fresh pico de gallo and you'll see why the ladies swoon and the men groom. My sister from another mother, Quesadilla ($5.95) is a total sweetheart. She's wide, thin and crispy all covered with cheese and I mean that in the nicest possible way. She, Mild and Spicy have a triad relationship, all complementing one another in each melted bite.Baja Chicken Burro ($8.35) is one of my favorite uncles. He's the uncle who shows up delicious and golden brown, draped in an outrageous creamy coat of sour cream and cilantro, Id have to say he is all about glamour and fashion. Much like season 1 of Project Runway where Jay McCarroll and Wendy Pepper would cat fight every single week, my uncle Baja simply does not get along with auntie Huevos Rancheros ($8.35), a snide but delicious bitch. Her fluffy eggs are perfectly cooked, her delicious Ranchero sauce and her rice and beans make for a satisfying anytime platter.Not liking to sound like a total me-me, I do have to say that I taste pretty good wrapped around Carne Asada con Pico de Gallo ($11.75). Tender steak grilled to a nice medium and served with pico de gallo, rice and beans. All you have to do is fill me up with some of your juicy meat and it's a win-win scenario. I get to soak up your meat juice and you get to eat all 6" of my round deliciousness.Every family has a black sheep and mine is no exception. Coming from a Greek father and a Mexican mother, Gyros Chimi ($8.50), is one of mystery and excitement. Inside she is full of tender slices of roasted gyro meat, gently deep fried then she's covered in the perfect accessory, creamy cucumber sauce. To add to her difference she is served with a hearty baked zucchini complete with sliced onion and a rich tomato sauce. You'll have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you take your first bite, delish.Unlike auntie Huevos, the Chorizo and Egg Burro ($6.55), is tasty and uncomplicated. Any chance I get to soak in sauce I'm so there! Try the #106 Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice & Beans ($8.55) for a celebration of soak. Stuffed with cheese then covered in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce I taste real good if I can say so myself. I also enjoy being bent over, deep-fried then filled with beef and topped with lettuce and tomatoes. One bite into my crunchy exterior exposes my goods for you to enjoy completely.I'm a firm believer that a meal is never complete without something sugary, it doesn't have to be too big. Fry bread with Cinnamon & Honey ($3.25) is sticky and sweet cousin of mine, who I like to call Fannie. Like my other cousin Quesapilla, she's golden brown, chewy and drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. After tasting Fannie, you might wonder why you've never given her a taste before?Now that I've been able to share so much of myself with you here today, I feel a great peace and inner joy that can only be brought out by my loyal fans. In whatever form I take from a taco to a warm steamy basket know this, I am here for u.What do you know, I went back!  The owner was kind enough to email me a while back and we discussed what it was I was unhappy with, he gave me some recommendations based on my tastes, and he sent me a gift certificate to try them out again.  This time around, instead of a dismal one star rating, I find myself wavering between 3 and 4.  I will clarify that I would like to give this place 3.5 but I am rounding up because I have never had chicken as juicy as I did the other night in my entire life.The husband and I stopped by here right after work, at about 4, and there were a handful of tables already full.  As the time progressed, it became much busier.  I would also like to report that the strong artificial cherry port-a-potty smell I picked up on last time is no longer there.  All I smelled was the food.  We seated ourselves, I glanced over the menu, and I knew what I was going to order.  Thanks to reviews from nathan and Amber, I ordered the quesapilla as an app, and for my entree, I went with the Baja Chicken Burro per the owner's suggestion.The Quesapilla came out quickly and was already oozing cheese.  I cut it open to share and I couldn't help but stare and watch the cheese slowly fall out.  It was like porn to me.  I have an addiction to food porn.  The taste of it was fantastic.  The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.  The Baja Chicken Burro (a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked, then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce) was delicious.  The outside was perfectly crisp, there was just enough cheese, and the cream cheese sauce was perfect!  I was nervous about the sauce because I am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but this was really great.  It was slightly spicy with a really nice cooling effect because of the dairy.  The chicken was incredible.  It was so juicy and so flavorful I thought I might have a foodgasm.  I can't believe I am saying that about Mexican food, but it's true.  They know their chicken.Overall, the food was fantastic, much better this time, but the service was okay.  It started off really strong with our drinks coming immediately after we ordered them, and subsequently our food, but after we finished we were left waiting about 20 or so minutes just to get our check.  I also couldn't help but notice while we were waiting, that this place seems to be so friendly.  The owner knew so many of the customers by name and was genuinely interested in their lives.  It was refreshing to see that kind of friendliness.  I take back my original review, it was very clearly an off day.  My husband and I very much enjoyed our food this time around.  Next time I have a taste for Mexican food (probably next cinco de mayo week) I will think about stopping by again.the scene: san francisco girl fondly accustomed to cold and foggy summer days takes on a seemingly endless road trip to the fiery hell pits of arizona. desperately in search of good mexican food. i never realized how much i hated being in cars until i took a road trip with my mom and dad a month ago. it's not my parents fault, i love hanging out with them. they're hilarious. only my dad can take a boring 15 minute story and turn it into an exciting 3 hour one, and only my mom can debate about something so ridiculous everyone ends up in a fit of laughter. i just don't like being held hostage for hours, trapped in a suffocating seatbelt...... we headed further away from san francisco and closer to LA, and then it hit me all of a sudden. all i could think about was how much i was craving an enormous margarita with some great mexican food. i endured more hell when we were forced to turn off the A/C driving through the damn grapevine as my dad yapped on and on about the time my uncle jerry went on a 4 day casino binge with my auntie jeannie and an oxygen tank (don't ask).we finally hit LA and proceeded east on Hwy 10 towards the arizona border while the thermometer crept towards triple digits.... i couldn't stop thinking that my enormous margarita and mexican food was getting closer by the minute. time dragged by as we passed a random cactus or five through indio, coachella and finally blythe, until the border finally came into sight. i was giddy. the last stretch! through the 112 degree arizona desert to, downtown central phoenix... my mouth could already taste the margarita. it would be potent, it would be served in a large glass. on the rocks, no salt. i call my brother, hands shaking.... "JOEY dammit, i need good mexican. big margaritas. cheap. NOW!"our little slice of heaven just happened to be about a block or so from my brothers place, so we picked him up along the way. i could hardly contain myself as we soared into Mi Patio's parking lot, my door already open before the engine was off.i noted as we walked in it's not big or fancy, but it's cheerful, festive and warm. mom and pop type joint. you can tell by the smell, the food is going to be good.  yes, they serve $1.75 margaritas. you read that right, $1.75... my mom looked worried when she saw the gleam on my face. as you can probably guess, these cheap wonders aren't all that potent, or all that big. so i just ordered an extra shot with mine and the price was still only a few bucks more. the $2 beer specials made my dad pretty happy. the bar, already packed, seemed to be an obvious happy hour spot.next the food. no salsa is ever hot enough for my dad. it burned my mouth pretty good, but i'm not exactly a manly man so i stuck to the milder one... my brother, dad and i all ordered the carne asada picado burro while my mom had the chicken burro. now my mom is a mere 97 lbs and rarely finishes her whole plate, so it's really a testament to this place that she almost did, or even tried. (especially since they really heap the food on) the collective response from around our table was... yummm. for the price, you're coming out way ahead. trust me.halfway through dinner, as they seated 3 strapping phoenix police officers next to our table, i realized the quality of the food here wasn't just my imagination (or the effects of heavy tequila consumption). in my experience, anywhere you see a gaggle of local cops eating, is a sign of decent food. right?i left there thinking, what sweltering desert? do your worst arizona! if you keep feeding me like this, i'll take on your heat any day of the week.SO after working all day... then going to school.. first english...and then a TWO HOUR MATH class... i start craving some horchata like no other!! the entire drive home all i could think of was that luscious creamy rice milk.... mmmmm..... i get home and its 930pm already.... we don't go out much... so we kinda drove around until we found a Mexican food restaurant that was open and pulled in... there were still a few people inside so were thought SCORE!!!! we walk in and the guy at the cashier was super nice... he seated us... i of course ran to the ladies room... mmmm i give it a 3..... its didn't smell to pleasant.... and yes i do expect a bathroom to smell good... you don't wanna your customers to loose their appetites right?? by the time i got back we already had our drinks and some chips and salsa i love so much! right away i order some horchata!!! but they freeze theirs.... i never had it like that before... but it was good : ) I Got a beef Tostada... oh it was shredded beef.. and they were very generous : ) and my roommate got a Quesadilla it was the size of a med pizza!! it looked sooo yummy!!.... the service was supper speedy but our waiter seemed a little irritated... and then the bar turned off its lights... lol we were those annoying people that come in 5 minutes before closing!!!! i felt soooo bad!!! especially after hearing tid bits of what the other employees were saying to our waiter before they left.... (they were speaking Spanish... i know very little) we tried to eat as quick as possible... the cashier guy came over and finished being our Waiter... he was so nice... they closed at 10pm we were done and out by 10:08..... i don't think I've ever only spent 18 minutes in a sit down Restaurant before! lol ahhhh the things we do for our horchata cravings....Last Time i visited this place i dropped in my business card (finally a good use for them lol) and with in that next week i got a coupon in the mail for a free meal! HEYA!!! I have been itching to use it for days!! The best part is that it is only a block or so away from my school, class gets out right before 9... and it closes at 10... just enough time... math makes me crave Mexican, i cant help myself.... last night i had the shredded beef burrito with cheese and sour cream inside... and beans on the side... i was in heaven!!! Their beef is soooo goooodddd!!!! i think they are starting to recognize us.. lol Mmm I'm In love with this place!!I had been wanting to try Mi Patio for a long time.  But since it's all the way "in the avenues" as my husband says, it's taken awhile.I have to say I was almost a little disappointed upon arriving to find that it is a fairly nice restaurant, not the hole-in-wall, don't look under the table, in the window sills, and especially the kitchen, kind of place that we all know have the BEST food.  And with a nicer store front usually comes a higher price tag.  Mi Patio is no different.  Combination plates are in the $10 range.  Kind of expensive for Mexican food in my opinion.  Perhaps I'm still living in 1978.In spite of that, we were seated and introduced to their chips and salsa.  The chips, unfortunately, were cold.  Had they been hot, they would have been the thin and crispy tortilla chips I love.  But the salsa was really really really good.Because my husband and I have vowed to eat less in 2010, we shared a meal, an appetizer in fact.  Unfortunately, it was the $17 appetizer supreme that would have fed half of Mexico.  A pizza-sized platter filled with mini chimis, flautas, red chile nachos, and gyro slices (I thought that was odd, but my husband loved them).  We had wonderful service with two people making sure our drinks were kept filled.The sampler had enough variety for me to learn I will happily make the trek back to "the avenues" for Mi Patio again.Mi patio do you keep your servers on a strict diet of beatings, verbal intimidation, and benzedrine?because my server was insanely good-so good that it was suspicious... like this gentleman had his A game on, no effing joke, and i noticed he never said one word to us and never really looked us in the eye in a word: servile.we'd be sitting there and he'd be back with fresh refills of our beverages and a non stop, everlasting supply of chips and salsa the second our portions got vaguely low. once we'd barely touched our chips he'd be back with a brand new batch piping hot and crispy. probably amongst the best service i have ever encountered in my short life.Now as far as the food goes, top knotch! knotch has a silent k right? lets assume it does.the food here is deeee lish us! berry berry nice! and cheap as dirt! i swear mi patio must be running dope on the side their food and drinks are so cheap! how can they afford this!? seriously!?(sheriff joe and your cronies/goons if for some ungodly reason your're reading this the aforementioned comments were complete hyperbole and meant to be taken lightly)Mi patio you are a gem a true gem. great location, great prices, great food, superb service!What does 5 stars really mean?  To me, it is based on the individual restaurant providing great food, over-the-top-service, ambiance, cleanliness, fair prices and portions for the TYPE of restaurant that it is.  I feel that some people here are missing the boat with their reviews, as they will RAVE about the restaurant, food and service, but then only give it 3 stars!  How completely unfair!   So, in my reviews, this means that I could give a FANTASTIC McDonald's a 5 star rating if they DESERVED it, but I wouldn't give them 2 stars because of comparing them to a gourmet burger shop!  They are who they are, and if they do it well, they deserve the best praise.  With this thought in mind, ANY restaurant, no matter how simple or elaborate, has the same fair opportunity to earn 5 stars from me, if they deserved it.  If you understand what I'm saying then here goes my review....Mi Patio is a mid to low price point Mexican restaurant.  Most things on dinner menu were around $7.00 - $8.00.  The atmosphere is simple and not intended for a "night out on the town".  My ex-husband and I went there tonight.  We had two large entrees, two large size margaritas and the bill was $5.00 after our $20.00 Groupon was applied. The service was top-notch, fast and efficient.  Our waiter explained the specials in a way that enticed me to order one.  The bus-boy refilled our salsa and chips at the perfect moment without being asked.  Our food was served hot and in large portions.  In the middle of the meal, our waiter presented us with two shot glasses full of a "surprise" on-the-house-special drink that was very tasty.  When we approached the register to pay after the meal, the gentleman was very friendly about taking our Groupon and he had a genuine spirit of appreciation for us coming into the restaurant, leading me to believe he may have been the owner.    Although this was not a 5-star meal, this place certainly DESERVES 5 stars.You don't come here because you are looking for authentic Mexican food.  You don't come back here because you think to yourself "oh wow that chimichanga was the best I ever had."  You come because:1. They have random fake birds hanging all over the celing  2. They have $1.99 margaritas made from a mix with the cheapest tequila.3. They put an entire tub of sour cream on your chimichanga4. They give your kid balloon puppies upon entering5. They are family owned and always smiling (not even sure how this is possible)6. The chips are always stale and they keep them coming7. The salsa is above average and makes those stale chips taste even better8. You can dine with random cardboard hottiesSo, just keep drinking those margaritas, eating those stale chips, looking at random birds and eating your sour cream on top of a very deep friend chimichanga because nothing else matters in life.   And most likely you will find me here because this place is just plain fun.
Qdoba Mexican Grill=I received a catered meal from here on Mon. night at a talk that I attended.  It contained a chicken burrito, a few chips and pico de gallo, and half a brownie.  While edible, the chicken burrito was nothing special--it contained mostly rice, plus some chicken and the standard black beans.  There were very few veggies, and no extras, included in the burritos.  While I understand that not everyone may want guac, sour cream, cheese, etc. in their burritos, it would be nice to offer a small portion of these as an accompaniment either in each meal, or a larger portion of them with the order for people to apply as they please.  I found the lack of extras especially ironic in light of Qdoba's recent ad campaign about extras not costing extra.Based on past experience, I believe the quality of this meal is representative of the quality of product at this Qdoba.  I visited with my labmates for lunch a little over a year ago, and recall being similarly underwhelmed by the nachos and quesadilla, both of which are two of my favorite Americanized Mexican foods.  Way back in 2007, when I tried Chipotle and Qdoba for the first time in Fort Collins, CO, I recall preferring Qdoba, because I felt that the product was similar in quality, but I appreciated the greater choice that Qdoba offered (I'm more into nachos and quesadillas than burritos, TBH).  However, based on more recent experience, I feel that the product quality at Qdoba (at least, at this location) has declined.  If they want to remain competitive with the similar business across the street, they need to kick up the product quality a notch.  As it were, they won't be receiving my business again anytime soon.
Ocha Cuisine=Galloping honeypots, Ocha Thai is a find![1] Their plain Jane interior may not impress, but their Thai and Chinese cooking will.Considering Ocha is in the shadow of the Stratosphere, they might seem to be a bit of a dive, especially in comparison to other spots on the Strip. On the contrary, Ocha is clean, and their service wicked fast: we were seated, had our orders taken, and got our food before we could blink. For their speed, we never were rushed.Everything was expertly prepared, from start to finish. We enjoyed their beef jerky appetizer ($8.95) - chunks of tender spiced beef brisket, sundried then deep-fried - as much as the sweet sauce that came on the side. Their chicken tom yum soup (8.95), flavored with mushrooms, lemongrass, chili and lime juice, helped ward off hunger.For entrees, try their pad thai chicken (8.95), stir-fried with bean sprouts, and a lime on the side. It's slightly sweet, with a perfect, light texture. A few plates of combination (pork, chicken, beef) fried rice (9.95/plate) rounded off our meal nicely. (Somehow we ended up with sticky rice too, but I didn't try any.)Recommended for a comfortable, affordable lunch.[1] Thanks Vy for taking me here! Getting here was an adventure, but worth the effort.Delicious authentic Thai food. Every time we come in we get what they call "the crying tiger". It's steak on a bed of lettuce that comes out with these 2 sauces. The sauces are the highlighters! This is why you cry when u eat this dish. Lol it is spicer then anything but it's also extra delicious so you just can't get enough of it! One sauce is red (my favorite) and one is green (burns your whole mouth). I honestly love spicy foods but the green sauce might just be my limit! The dish comes out with rice. I usually make like a little lettuce wrap with it. You can just dip the meat in the sauce and eat it with rice. Which ever way.. It's extra delicious. Also you can substitute the meat with chicken which is what my beau does because he's on a diet and can only eat chicken. But if you want chicken breast you have to call ahead and check if they have it because they don't always carry chicken breast. But either way it's still bomb.I've also had the chicken Pad Thai which was amazing as well. I actually ate the whole dish by myself which NEVER happens! Lol The staff are really attentive and nice. They make sure they come and talk to us and converse. Waters are always full. And one time one of the species took over my throat and I was coughing up a storm and they Gave me a free Thai tea! Which actually helped with the heat. Love this place and usually come in once a week or once every other week!
The Common Market=Reviewing Common Market on Yelp seems almost like a right of passage. Will I be the first yelper to extoll the virtues of this deli/convenience store/bar? By no means, but do I honestly value this local gem? You bet your bottom dollar! Common Market's strength is that it can be many things depending on what you need. Hungry for a meal? Go into the deli and you can choose from one of their concoctions (I recommend the reuben on rye, no mustard) or make up one of your own. Vegetarian? They have plenty of options for you as well (The mid-eastern wrap is particularly tasty). Just looking for a snack to quell the (possibly late night) munchies? They have all kinds of tasty chips, pretzels, cookies and soft drinks to satisfy.Oh, you wanted a slightly stronger drink? Well you are sure in the right place. Chilled, room temp, individual, 6-packed, in a case or on tap, Common Market has a beer selection to astound. Whether it's a PBR night or you are looking for your favorite craft brew they are prepared. I should mention they also sell wine, but with so many unique beers I tend to forget.Did you want more of a destination than a grab and go? No problem. They've got tables inside and out on their patio. They have weekly live music performances. Or you could just pick up a copy of the paper and do the crossword.Worried about parking? They have spaces in the front, a lot in the back, there is street parking and a large lot around the corner. Oh, and they have bike racks out back.Do be advised that they have a $5 credit/debit minimum, so have cash if you are just grabbing a snack or drink.Wow! Coolest beer shop I've been to in a long time! This place is amazing. They've got it all! The beer selection here is quite impressive. They specialize in hard to find beers, with a section for sour beers, IPAs, and seasonals. They have a small bar, where you can get a beer on tap, and drink it there, or out on their nice patio. They also sell wine! They've got a wine expert on site to help you with your selections. The staff is also quite knowledgeable about their beers as well. Since I was an out-of-towner, they were able to steer me to the best local beers, made just down the street. The store also sells weird knickknacks and strange toys, like pigeon masks, or red fuzzy fezes.  The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant. They made the visit quite enjoyable. In the back, they have a deli with a wide variety of sandwiches, and a vending machine that sells musical accessories, like drum sticks and guitar strings. The place isn't exactly clean, but I get the feeling that they're going for a dive vibe, which is certainly working for this place. The patio is nice and large, with outdoor heaters and plenty of seating. They allow you to bring your beer purchased inside out onto the patio and drink it right there. This is something I'm not accustomed to, but I really enjoyed the experience! If you're looking for something good to drink, this is your place.
Beach Pizza=Stopped here as part of my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I live in the neighborhood, so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a try.  I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!I wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza "well done" and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami, Mortadella, Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Italian Dressing, $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly "fell" out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty, but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup, but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=Iqzb-H48B0AgB0vX-tKhDgNext I went for the Pizza.....I took one bite and thought it might have been a bust....but it grew on me.  The Crust is chewy and the Tomato Sauce has an interesting flavor.....all I can say is that I wanted more and that's always a good thing....for now, I'll give it 3 Stars.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=xHoP8sxg9hyWexhiY6x52AThe employees are really friendly too and I think it's family owned, which I love.  Overall, the joint gets 3 Stars and the Pizza will definitely get a 2nd try from me.Return Factor - 80%
Diamond's Chinese Restaurant=Thank God we live in America. I can't imagine that this could be the standard in another country.I have been to next-door Los Compadres hundreds of times, but never ventured into Diamonds. It's a weird Chinese looking building, but as many times as I've driven by, I'd never gone in. Until recently.My brother and I resolved to finally check it out. We parked in back and made our way toward the front door. There was water streaming across the driveway into the gutter, and white bits of something were strewn throughout. I didn't think much of it at the time.When we opened the door, we were instantly greeted with the sight, sound and smell of 5 huge aquariums, all holding seafood that presumably was going to be eaten soon. I got the distinct impression that the floor hadn't been swept in three or four months.After we made our order and sat waiting for our take out, I noticed a large brown spot on the front of the counter. Hmmm... And then it moved. Oh my god. This is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life. It must have been five inches long. I was mortified such that I could not find my voice. And then a second one appeared, and then a third. OMG. I finally got the manager's attention and pointed to it. She quickly moved to the front of the counter, and cupping her hand, caught it, and then scurried back to the kitchen with it.I was going to be sick. I ran toward the bathroom, and found myself splashing through a big puddle all the way to the toilet. UGH. The toilet was already full from someone before me. So I flushed. And then came the most wrong sound you've ever heard come from a water pipe as and what was in the toilet started rising to the top. I fled and grabbed my brother by the arm.As I squished my way back along the walkway toward the driveway, I realized what was streaming across the parking lot and into the gutter. It was raw sewage littered with bits of wet toilet paper.Someone needs to shut this place down.$35 buy you black beans clams, steam fish topped with shredded ginger, ginger & onion lobster, and no charge on rice!  You might find this type of deal in New York, Cali or Chicago, rarely in Arizona.     I felt I grew up with this restaurant.   My family has been coming here for years.  It has been so many years that I have back.   I was really impressed with the consistency of the dishes.  Everything still tasted delicious.  If you want authentic Chinese food, do not order from the regular menu; ask for the Chinese one with English translation.  You will not be disappointed! The clay pot beef tendon/stew (the gravy goes well with other dishes if you don't like the meat) and pea seedling/Dou Miao with garlic sauce are a must try.*** Note*** Go here knowing that you'll get good and affordable food, but find the service and ambiance lacking.
Waffle House=Great location to soak up some drink before you go home to pass out. The staff can be nice or rude depending on you. (I prefer rude) The food is good, nothing pretentious or assuming. You get what they give you and you eat it. I don't think I would bring Mom for Sunday Breakfast but for a quick bite, it hits the spot. Better then Denny's unless you want your Superbird or French Toast. The waitress was even nice enough to call a cab for us.If restaurants were fairy tales, Waffle House is "Prince and the Pauper". Its an exercise in humility. It allows you to see how the rest of the world eats while you're eating 25 dollar salads."Oh what a wonderfully horrid place! Now, if we could only find the hostess..."Can't afford a hostess. Sorry. Just find a table. Try to find one that's clean. "Very well. Oh, I do think I would enjoy some sparkling water and cranberry juice-"There's soda and there's coffee. Or they have two flavors of water; dirty tap and dirty tap with ice. "Oh, um, very well. There doesn't seem to be enough menus for everyone at our party."Share."Oh...um, fair enough then. I will have the all-star special, with cheese on my eggs and, how do you say it, my hash browns 'smothered' and 'covered'? Oh that sounds so delightfully filthy."Whatever turns you on, man."Oh dear me, they're cooking it right in front of us...that man's not wearing any plastic gloves! He's man-handling my food with his bare hands! This is outrageo--oh wait...is this how you lowly folk eat? Well then, don't mind me! GET YOUR HANDS ALL OVER MY FOOD, GOOD MAN! IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE SOME EXTRA HAIR IN MY BACON! HAHAHA!"..."No, seriously, I didn't want any hair in my bacon"Okay, well let me just pluck it out off your plate. All better then."Did you just put YOUR hands on my food too!? The gall! The bravado! I love it!"How's your food?"My bacon's crunchy, I can feel the cheese you've smothered all over my eggs clogging my arteries, these hash browns are a texture and consistency I've never seen occur in nature anywhere, and another cup of this coffee and I'll be able to do wind sprints back to my house. I absolutely love it! I'm never going back to my old life of roasted pheasant and caviar ever again. Do you hear me world, EVAR!"It's something like that. For serious.
New Tokyo Food Market=Went to New Tokyo Food Market today for some Japanese staples...Miso soup, nori (dried seaweed), Osenbei (flavored rice crackers), Furikake (dried seasoning mix) and Panko bread crumbs for Tempura recipes and they carry many other hard to find Japanese products. Prices are very reasonable and most products are authentic and not Americanized versions. Owner came over and helped us with our selections without being asked! Very helpful and nice!  Highly recommend this market located on S/E corner of 35th Ave. and Northern. Parking area is limited however! Banzai!!!!
Pho Saigon 8=When you're in Vegas and someone has a car, the obvious choice is to eat off-strip. Pho was the consensus. And so I suggested Pho Kim Long, the only pho place I knew in the area. That was quickly shot down. Dang should've known better than to suggest a pho place to Vietnamese people. LOL! Pho Saigon 8 was 3-4 miles from the strip; 15-20 minute ride with traffic. The restaurant was spacious; clean and bright with modern décor. The staff was hilarious and super accommodating! My friends asked for things I've never heard of for their pho and the servers immediately brought out the requests and in large quantities; some sort of herb, the fat from the broth and onions soaked in oil. My order of charbroiled chicken over rice vermicelli was so refreshing! Loads of noodles and chicken! Yum! Awesome lunch!Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.Been there once... and that's okay for me.You are greeted when you walk in and sat at a table. They will then take your order. You will get your order within 5-10 minutes. Awesome!!!BUT don't expect to see them again for the remainder of your meal. This is how most Vietnamese restaurants operate but this location does it much more apparently. There is a sign in front that says "please pay here." This saves the restaurant staff the closing step of service, which is to bring out your bill. I understand why they do this, however it makes paying the bill and leaving a tip a less personable experience. The restaurant is usually always busy which makes eating here somewhat of an experience but other than that...consider this a fast casual spot.
Murray Avenue Grill=I came to Murray Avenue Grill for my birthday brunch a few months ago, and I was impressed.  My friend and I had been hoping to go to Pamela's, but when the wait was two hours, we decided to try here out.  There was no wait on a Sunday morning around 10:30.  I've yet to try Pamela's, but I don't think I'll ever make it there since this is right across the street!How do you start brunch on your birthday?  With a birthday mimosa, of course!  The mimosa was delicious and not terribly priced.  From there I moved to a massive breakfast burrito, covered in tomatoes.  I couldn't quite finish the whole thing, but I took it to go and ate it later.  I definitely would order it again.  My friend ordered steak and eggs, and the steaks were a really nice size for the price.The wait staff was friendly, and I cannot wait to come back here to try out the lunch and dinner menus!
Lupie's Cafe=My favorite thing about this place: it's walking distance from my house and I can wear sweatpants there with no judgement. Or maybe they are judging me. Oh well.My buddy Vijay and I swung by for dinner last Tuesday. I was super bummed when I saw that the special the night before was meatloaf. However, it was my lucky day. They still had meatloaf left! Hip, hip... hooray! No mashed potatoes, though. Sigh, guess I have no choice but to eat delicious mac n cheese. When in Rome, you have to get the chili. We couldn't decide which one to get. Our server suggested mixing two together. Brilliant. We went with Texas and Southern. Texas is on the spicy side. I liked the combo of the two. Vijay also got a burger. Holy. This thing was huge. I was shocked when he was able to eat the whole thing. I have to get up here on a Thursday. Why? The special is chicken and dumplings. Sounds like the perfect meal on a chilly night. Not to be confused with chili....
Jeff's Bucket Shop=Not so sober review #339Dear Diary,I started drinking today in the most civilized way, bubbly with a girlfriend out of fancy, thrift store, vintage, bird bath champange glasses, oh la la la. Then went to a holiday bubbly tasting, snacks at Good Food on Montford, then all hell breaks loose.We are walking by Jeff's Bucket Shop, my friend says, "what's Jeff's Bucket Shop?" Well. I don't know, I could tell you exactly where it is, but have I been there? No. So, I was like, let's go find out.You walk down a narrow hallway with a HUGE neon lit arrow pointing to the door, OMG, you had me at HELLO!  We walk into a teeny tiny bar, with the bartender and a few patrons. Everyone is low key, but friendly. The bartender is super, super nice.  Oh Jeez, it's loaded with boys and there are some cute ones. Oh my. Yummy, little Debbie snack cakes and drink specials, nice barkeep and kaorake at 10p.  Sweet Jesus, give me the mike. but no, not even loaded with alcohol, I'm still too shy.I might say, now don't quote me tomorrow, but right now, I love you Jeff.This is a hole in the ground kinda place... you heard me, I said ground not wall, considering you literally walk down a narrow stairwell to get to the little door in order to discover this little establishment.  By the way, I do mean LITTLE, I've seen someone's bathroom bigger than this joint.Let's be real peeps... this place is put in the "Dive Bar" category for a reason.  Besides, the place is called "Jeff's Bucket Shop,"  I seriously for the longest time don't even know of its existance... or what the heck Jeff is selling by the bucket, or if Jeff is trying to sell buckets, or who the heck is Jeff?!  So yes, there maybe a little weird smell (frankly I don't even pay attention to it, and I have a super good nose, but I do have high tolerance for "weird smell" courtesy of my heritage lol).  My personal suggestion is stop asking what the heck that smell is (because you probably don't want to know) and just keep drinking.I have been here mostly on Fridays and they have karaoke.  I think they have karaoke on other nights too.  Not sure if they always have the same host, and if he is the regular, let me warn you, he doesn't play... he will gong you off that stage like you're on Apollo if you are seriously tone-deaf.  This place gets packed.  So if you have issues with being too crowded, well... not sure if you want to sardine your way into here on a weekend night.  And again, if you are the high-er maintanence type, you may want to stick with your "safer" choices and go next door or across the street or uptown.  But honestly, it's always a good crowd, nice people having fun together, beer isn't too expensive, and I always have a blast here.
Fajitas A Sizzlin Celebration=The curious case of the disappearing review. I'm sure I've reviewed Fajita's before, but it seems to have vanished.Fajita's has some spectacular lunch specials. I give them 5 full stars for their lunch, not so much for dinner (much more pricey), which some how I've determined equals out to 4 stars.So, go there for lunch, munch on some tasty fajitas on the cheap. Being a vegetarian, I thoroughly enjoy the veggie fajitas for a mere $5. They make their own in house tortillas, which are unique and very good. They also include their tasty chips & salsa for every customer.Awesome lunch spot.Ive driven past this place on the freeway about a million times and has always vowed that one day, i will try this place! and out of complete randomness.... it became my Saturday night dinner :) As we park the car, we could already tell this place was packed! we walked in and there were parties waiting to be seated ... lucky for us... we were seated right away... I'm sure we deemed ugly hungry stares for it to... hey its not our fault their are only two of us.... right after we were seated our drink orders were taken by a very welcoming young gentleman. :) and out chips and salsa were brought out promptly too! The Salsa was amazing... and the chips were fresh ... and hot!! that could have been my meal i was so content.... this place has great lighting.... not to bright or too dull... just how i like it. in the middle of the place there was a huge area where they cooked all the food... or at least some of it... it looked like fun.... we shared the beef Fajitas... they were amazing!! grilled on top of bell peppers and onions... red and white... mm served with rice, beans w/cheese, guacamole and a tray of salsa, sour cream and cheese... it was SO good and they brought out your tortillas in a little bowl with a cover to keep them warm.. but they tasted more like pita bread... either way everything was hot and fresh and out in a very timely fashion.. especially since this place was packed... i like this place alot... i would love to come back again and maybe sit near the chefs area :)I was thrilled to be able to come to Fajitas for my friend's birthday lunch. This restaurant has been around for what seems like eons and a very fitting venue to celebrate the big 4-0! In fact, this place was a regular haunt of mine for years and I even had my 17th birthday party here (with my friend Kari the now 40 year old!).We had a party of 16-Kari's family, her parents, siblings and their families. We were seated at a long table and the first thing I noticed is that the decor is exactly the same as it was since we were in high school. The menu changed a little bit, but the salsa and chips were the same too. We had a nice waitress, the iced tea was great and we ordered cheese crisps to start and as a table ordered beef, chicken and shrimp fajitas along with a couple of sides of guacamole.The cheese crisps arrived first and were incredible. Ivy, if you are reading, this is a must have cheese crisp!Better than both Macayo's or Garcia's hands down. Light, crisp and fabulous. In fact I liked the cheese crisps better than the fajitas! The fajitas arrived, the shrimp had good flavor but were small and shriveled looking and obviously overcooked. The steak wasn't as good as I remember it and realized we didn't order the more expensive meat (cadillac) so that could be why. The chicken was perfectly cooked and really good. The tortillas are great-these have been around since before Chevy's hit the Phoenix area and I will admit the guacamole was delicious and quite the surprise. I was thrilled at how good the meal was and even more thrilled to be celebrating with my friend at a place that has so much history within our friendship.For those of you who are Fajita's newbies-here is a warning. This is the type of restaurant that the food smell sticks to you inside and out. I knew we were coming here so I had planned on what to wear-even down to the bra I traveled in and knew I would be doing laundry before I packed to come home the next day. Yep, long running joke about Fajita burps, farts, and clothing and they are all true so beware! Years ago, they didn't have a product like Febreeze. Now that they do, makes eating here a lot easier!Stumbled upon Fajitas while driving around......lost in Phoenix.Frikkin' GPS! Left turn here! Right turn now!!! We damn near hit a lightpole before we got our asses good and lost! Grrr!!! Anyway, somehow through this mess we located Fajitias and yazz, yazz!!!Ya' can't go wrong with amazing deals! The place is actually quite huge and the margaritas (offered at $3/each) didn't disappoint. We'd actually ordered the Mexican pizza as an appetizer thinking we'd be able to make it to an actual entreé (#fajitas)....But this thing arrived and was so huge that it literally became a meal. The savings from not ordering an actual entreé allowed us to order extra booze. We departed full of food and booze for less than $20. Unbeatable!!!
Fazoli's=I had a coupon so stopped by for lunch. It was still to expensive. I had a Turkey Club  and a double slice of Cheese Pizza. With coupon it was still almost $11 and my pizza was burnt to hell. I couldn't even eat the pizza because all of the burnt black spots just didn't look right. The turkey sub was just okay. I can get a bigger sub from Subway that tastes better. With the right coupon I do like certain things here but they aren't consistent as far as the taste and quality of the food. There is a drive thru or you can eat inside and get free bread sticks.
Hambone's Pub=Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. The brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. So here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. It just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. Not sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch.Disclaimer: my only experiences at Hambone's are for drinks only and I have not had food other than the buffalo dip.Now that PHI is gone, Hambone's is one of the bars that can fill the gap in my soul that can only be filled by the greatest of dives. I just wish it would have been closer to Oakland when I was in school. I have never had a negative experience here with service and the regulars are very friendly. If you are around on a Thursday night, you must stop in for comedy open-mic night. There are plenty of other events that happen (I think Wednesdays are board game night, that was a blast) and seating is usually adequate except during Thursday night in my experience. Drinks are cheap and they always have something fun - who would have thought about serving a Hug (the little plastic barrels filled with sugary drink) and a shot? Well a genius at Hambone's did.Put it on the list if you're having a bar crawl through Lawrenceville, or just start here and stay all night. You won't be disappointed.
Brother's Pizza="The perfect lover is one who turns into a pizza at 4:00 a.m."  - Charles PierceOne fateful night after a long grueling ten-hour shift, the ladies who work next door decided that we were going to grab some pizza and wings and complain relentlessly about working in customer service.  Pizza, wings, and a bitch-fest?  I'm down!Being that I'm not from the Avondale area, I never would have came across this place if it wasn't for my ladies.  We have invaded Brother's time-and-time again for years and we always get the same large pizza and wings special they have.  Wings are always lip-smacking delicious and the pizza is gigantic and oozing with cheese and grease.  The crust isn't strong enough to hold their generous amounts of toppings and is pretty flavorless by itself but we can always toss away the crust, right?  It's the kind of comfort food you need after a day of dealing with ignorant and difficult people.  One bite from this place I don't like:  the canoli.  Then again, I'm not crazy for canolis so what do I know?Brother's isn't a glamorous establishment by any means.  It's brightly lit, there are multiple televisions with sports on, the tables and booths are strong and sturdy, and there's a semi-sporty theme going on.  It's definitely not a romantic date spot but hey, you can grab a beer and catch a game while eating some cheap eats!
Dimas Tacos=About 15 years ago I would stop in here to grab breakfast before heading to work a couple times a week. I have noticed for sometime now that Dima's Tacos is still in business, so I made a point to come in for breakfast to see if it was like I had remembered. Inside is small with only maybe 4 or 5 tables. The woman who took my order was nice and gave me time to look over the menu. She also told me that they were not the original owners of Dima's and that it has changed hands over the years. Her and her husband recently started a lease, so anybody familiar with Dima's Tacos before might notice a difference in the menu and prices. Since it had been so long since my last visit, I just hoped for good food. The prices are fair depending on what you order. Some menu items are made fresh and other stuff isn't. My total was around $11.Agua Fresca - This wasn't made fresh and came from a fountain machine. It also tasted watered down. Cheese Quesadilla - Good size and really the only thing I enjoyed. It's kind of hard to mess up a cheese quesadilla.Bacon Breakfast Burrito - I knew it was not going to be like I remembered Dima's being all those years ago, but wow it really wasn't the same! The burritos used to be really big (double wrapped) and now they are long and skinny. I don'y mind since they use really big tortillas and it still ends up being a decent size. The scrambled eggs were not mixed all the way before being made, so I ended up with a white and yellow scramble, not good. There was only 2 or 3 small pieces of potato in the center and that's it. The burrito could have definitely used more potato. I also paid for extra cheese to be added and there was none at all. The bacon tasted good, but was hard at times.
Hooters Casino Hotel=I want an Owlzilla and I want one now *stomps feet*Fat bastard wouldn't sell me one and they are the only good thing about this place.  (Except for wings, read below)The casino is the size of a peehole.  The girls do not have hot hootz or hot asses.  Fuhglee bitches in tight orange shorts, shiny hosiery (that's pantyhose for hos), ohhh, you all know the uniform.Service is slow.  The bartender chick was ugly and rude and poured weak drinks, and I was PAYING for these drinks.  I understand to order beer if I'm gambling, but my pretty lil ass was sitting at the bar and I expect some vodka with my soda, thank you very much.Why two stars????  Because after 11pm, they serve 10 chicken wings for $2.50 and I'm a girl who likes a bargain.  The 9-1-1 wings were pretty spicy.  Almost a lil too spicy, but darn tasty.Never again Not So Hot Hootz-ers, unless I'm nearby and craving wings.So, I got a group of friends together to go to Vegas with me to ring in my 30th year of life. I had to keep in mind that some people are on a budget with kids, mortgages, etc. Bingo! Hooter's came up on my search. I'm not one of those women that are scared of Hooter's girls, so I didn't hesitate booking our stay there.When we arrived, I noticed the place was FULL of men. Perfect place for a single girl to stay! We were greeted by a friendly front desk staff who upgraded our rooms to "Ocean View" rooms due to my sheer awesomeness....ok I don't know why they upgraded us, but it was cool.My room was clean and comfy with a nice view. My bed was comfortable, nothing cushy or posh, but comfortable. The only things I would change would be to replace the carpet because it's old, brighten up the hallways a bit, and update the elevators. Other than that it's a cool little hotel. If I'm ever breezing in and out of Vegas again, I'll probably stay there to save some dough. It's nothing fancy, but it's a clean, budget friendly place to stay.Another yelper said they were giving out 10 Free Wings to new Rewards card members so I decided to take full advantage.I signed up for the Rewards card & got a funbook. It gave me $100 free slot play-i lost, 10 free wings, and 2 for 1 beer. So I went to Hooters had some wings and a steak sandwich. The food was decent-good meaty hot wings, i had them 3 mile island style.the atmosphere was incredible, and the price was just right. 20 wings, steak sandwich,4 beers less than $20There is a little bit of a wait since this place is packed but they have lots of TV's and the pool has a bar and firepits.Good food,limited menu but good prices so close to the strip.Hooters girls arent what they used to be, all the girls here look under 21 and they aren't so scntily clad as most cocktail waitresses in other casinos.The steak sandwich wasnt charbroiled but it was still fairly good, the wings were big and juicy wit ha little crunch, i liked them.The pool & the porch is the best seat in the house. Theres lots of Tv's everywhere to make sure you can catch the game from any seat in the house.I was in Vegas recently on business at a trade show. Saw some buddies that I used to interface and partner with, and so we decided to go out and eat and catch up. Let's see, you are in Las Vegas, on business, and of all the choices, where would you want to go? Since their company is very cheap, they have a very small expense allowance. And since their company definitely has a macho-like personality, sort of a frat brothers, locker room personna, they chose Hooters!I said "Are you kidding me?" I suggested going to Chinatown and getting some good, inexpensive food, like Thai, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and I had a car to take them all out there. But since it was 3 of them versus just me, it was Hooters.Hooters Hotel and Casino is exactly like their restaurants. Girls in white Tees and little orange gym shorts. You would think that here in Vegas, this would be their flagship location and they would upscale it in decor, amenities, and staffing. Nope. Even though it is a hotel and Casino, it has the same look and feel of their restaurants. What do they call themselves? Tacky? They got that right.Plus, Hooters has awful food. Deep fried, tasteless, unimaginative. It's food you might find in Talledega at the NASCAR races in the picnic coolers of the baseball cap wearing HVAC and Cable repair men. Only warmed up a bit. In Vegas, with all the beautiful women working here in the various service venues of shows, casinos, gentelmen's clubs, etc., Hooters has got to be the bottom of the barrel. The "talent" here is just above 7 Eleven, just wearing less. That makes the food that much more indigestible.Apparently, the Hooters Hotel has 24-hour $3 blackjack tables. I mean, there are banners posted against the building outside, there are signs above the slot machines...The Hooters Hotel is supposed to have 24-hour $3 blackjack tables.My friend and I walked into the Hooters Hotel.We looked for these $3 blackjack tables.We circled the casino three times.THERE WERE NO $3 BLACKJACK TABLES.One star for false promotions. (I was looking forward to cheap gambling too!)Some of my friends laughed and others scoffed at the fact that I had booked accommodations at the Hooters Casino Hotel for my Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon weekend in Las Vegas.It wasn't as bad as everybody told me it would be, and considering I booked many months in advance and found Expedia rates ranging from $45 to $55 a night for a room in the Tower building I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  For the race the "off the Strip" location was perfect as it was a comfortable fifteen minute walk to the start / finish area on race day.My room was okay since I only spent time there to sleep and to yelp.  With the exception of parts of the carpet the room was fairly clean too.  I wore white socks in the room and each night my white socks turned either light gray or charcoal colored depending on how much walking I did in the room.Here were some of the cool things about my room:*The queen size bed was firm and comfortable (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=iHWbOO5Jzfh31dVthmiB6Q).*Standard sized television (no flat screen) had crisp cable broadcasting.*Comfortable desk had a brand new issue of the latest Hooters magazine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=96qyqd-PoYisLKTjPUswuA).*There is a digital room safe just in case you decide to go out for a 13 or 26 mile run (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=BZMBwl3J5Y6vylsT0c-hBA).*Clean bathroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=dPRiakqkf2jm4_1Tyw-Iww).*Basic amenities (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=yqsvK9WYxf_OtSIjZUBXIA).*Free bottled water (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=S4pY5Ebf2pSWPyP59WTvmQ).  Runners love water!!*Two fake palms in the room look great without the flying insects (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=YBp_3-oEiKi-ayVqcVDe_w).*Amusing privacy door signs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=toTBsd8WeZhsSMAEALOiOQ).Of course there's always bad things that makes it a 3 star review:*The comforter was lumpy.*No free internet.  No problem as I brought a wireless card this time.*The deadbolt kept slamming into the door jamb.  I had to whip out my Leatherman and do a repair job for them.  The deadbolt works perfectly now.  You're welcome!!*Noisy pipes and the water pressure in the water closet was horrible.*Toilet tissue holder was too short and the spool would come loose and fall on the floor every time the tissue was in use.*Thin walls.  I heard every foul-mouthed conversation my neighbors had, but I heard every intimate one too!*Horrible, lazy housekeeping staff!  I did a better job cleaning up after myself!*Incompetent and slow check-in process.  The lady kept mispronouncing my last name.  How do you fuck up my last name?  It's three letters and the second and third letters are the same vowel.  Dummy!I didn't take advantage of the slot playing amenity that came with the room.  The casino downstairs is very small.  Like I said, if I could find these rates again I would return.  If not, don't bother!"You get what you pay for"If only that were the truth.Let's see....  We got there and:1) The elevator from the parking structure is out - so we hoof it from the 4th floor all the way to reception with our bags in tow.  2)We got booked into a smoking room when we specifically asked for a non-smoking room3)We got transferred to a non-smoking room (after a few hours) with a view of the Airport.... well, there would have been a view if the windows weren't so damned grimy4)Uncomfortable Bed5)Tube TV that kept cutting out every few minutes, which wouldn't have been bad on its own, but the batteries on the remote were dead.. HAH!Okay, at 25 bucks a night, I might have agreed that we got what we paid for and it might have been a So-so 2.5 to three stars.  MAYBE.But when you tack on an additional UNDISCLOSED $15/day "Resort Fee"  (What resort? it was 40 freakin Degrees out!), No Wi-Fi AND $15/day wired internet fee??  ....Umm... Yeah ... 1.5 stars and I'm not even going to round it up to two.PROTIP: Hooters appears to be where failed Import model wannabes with bad boob jobs go to die. - Enjoy.I'm pretty bias when it comes to eating at this popular chain.  Seems it doesn't take much to make me happy inside a Hooters restaurant.  Since I was staying in the hotel you would kind of figure that at least one of my meals would be at the Hooters restaurant.  I had lunch at this Hooters on the day of my departure.Seated immediately near the front entrance I was in a perfect spot to view some very nice eye candy.  Most of the ladies smile as they walk by here.  It made me happy too!  My waitress was a nice German girl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=RAW5jfLOBzpLhYENbeiHbw).  She was very friendly, and I loved her accent, but she was an excellent waitress also.  Despite how busy this place is during a weekday lunch rush she came by three or four times to make sure everything was okay and I had enough food and drink.I had a single order of ten wings, medium spicy and unbreaded (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=DYflGlGsO2mPs7T35u7a9g).  I also had an order of seasoned curley fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ?select=UFYn0PR07eWLb0UUEaigEA).  The wings were excellent, but the fries could have had a bit more zest.  No complaints from me though.  I love all Hooters restaurants!I've stayed in some of the worst roach infested seaside motels in California, and this was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in. It's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. The drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. They sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. It wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... Every shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.Sadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.In the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. I paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. If you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.Fuck this place.Vegas visitor beware.Let me start with the good and the only reason/s this hotel was worth a crap.1. it was free and comped to us by a friend 2. their 9$ prime rib was waaaay better than the Planet Hollywood 40$ filet mignon I had.Ok, now onto every other factor of this place. Hope your ready...1. hotel itself = disgusting, smells like urine and raid EVERYWHERE. Its so bad that I notified the hotel security and he laughed and said "really!? wow, i guess ive been here so long I cant even smell it."2. hotel security = bunch of idiots. we got locked out of our room, they would not let us back in even tho our IDs and personal effects that we could claim were inside. We had to go thru a stupid ordeal just to get allowed back in WTF!?3. Elevators = all of them broke and I found out that they dont really ever get fixed. Not only that, their is tagging and graffiti all over the place. Where the hell is your pride of ownership? Not to mention everytime we went inside them we had to hold our breath because if it wasnt the urine smell it was the overwhelming smell of raid roach spray!4. Dealers = i forgot her name but she was a total %&^%$ to us and made it completely un-fun to play they so we went and dropped a few hundred at PH Westgate instead, where we actually felt welcome5. Carpets = stains all thru-out. Disgusting!6. Room Service = incompetent. They delivered our food and then made us feel super bad because we didnt have EXACT change because guess what... they dont carry change on them when they deliver your food. Are you serious? She looked at me and went "you dont have change? ahhhhhhhh, i guess i can go back down and get your change if you really want me to" ... Are you ^%&^#ing joking me!? Of course I want you too idiot. I gave you an 18% gratuity to simply bring food to my door. You didnt cook it, you walked it up and dropped it off. So what? I should give you an extra 11 dollars cause you didnt bring change... BEAT IT!Over all, I brought a celebrity here and this place is a fricking joke. I would think even with someone of class we would be treated better. Its miserable and the owners should be ashamed of their establishment. I was embarrassed for them. I have been all over the world and never felt more unwelcome and inconvenienced.Owners - with all respect, i think its important you start communicating with your clients to hear and feel their disappointment. Feel free to contact me  danny@npmusic.comWow, I seriously cannot figure out what everyone is complaining about. I honestly think people need to take into consideration that at Hooters you get what you pay for. If you are paying $20 for a hotel room in Vegas do not expect to get a 5 STAR, luxury "Wynn" experience. What we got for our $20 per night was the following:1 clean, very basic hotel room.20 free wings at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel.2 free frozen drinks at the pool bar, plus one additional drink because it was "ladies week"2 free "American" breakfasts at The Mad Onion.In addition to all the freebies, we received excellent customer service from everyone we interacted with at Hooters. All the hotel bars have $1.50 Bud/Bud Light if you are looking for cheap beer. Room Service will deliver Hooters wings to your room. The pool is open 24/7. There is a pretty decent fitness room/gym. If you are so inclined, there is a tattoo parlor in the hotel. The location is good...It is a very short walk to the Las Vegas Strip from the hotel.Yes, the service at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel is slow.Yes, the parking garage and elevators are a little dingy.No, it did not smell like poo, urine, sewage, raid, or anything else that people have complained about. Two items of note:There is an $8 resort fee per day.There were many people on our floor who sat outside of their rooms, in the hallway, and smoked. So FYI, your room may be non-smoking but the hallway is not. If you are just looking for a cheap, clean, no-frills place to crash, Hooters will serve the purpose. If you are looking for anything more than that, this is not the place for you. Move along...nothing to see here.We were staying across the street at the MGM Grand, and every time I looked out the window by the elevator I saw the owl on the Hooters Casino sign staring at me.  It was hypnotic, and there is a strong possibility that the sign may have even winked at me (or maybe that I just needed to get some more sleep).  So I got a couple of people to walk with me across the street on an adventure to the Hooters Casino. From the outside, it looks like an oversize Hooters.  On the inside, the casino is tiny and smaller than anything I have seen on the strip.  We were able to walk through the entire casino in less than a couple of minutes.  There wasn't very many people in the casino, and there seemed to be more employees than patrons on a Saturday night.  All of the dealers were Hooters girls, deck out in their white and orange gear.  The theme of Hooters was evident and well maintained throughout.When we got to the back of the Casino, I went into the store to check out what they had.  They had some cute Hooters branded cloths, and I found a jersey top that I liked to buy for my wife.  After that, we took a look out the back door of the casino to see the pool.  It was pretty sad.  There were just a bunch of dudes hanging out, and not a Hooter in sight.  The pool looked like a giant sized Motel 6 pool, and did not look like a fun place to hang out at all.  So we headed back inside towards the front of the Casino.  We passed two restaurants on the way.  One of them being a Hooters, of course.  When we got to the front there was another store that I did not notice when we first walked in.  This store had lots more cloths and Hooters paraphernalia, so I went in to check it out and ended up buying more stuff.  They had a special in the store that if you buy $35 of merchandise you get a free gift.  The clerk at the registered informed me that for a $1.50 I could buy a sacky bag.  I thought I was a $1.50 off of hitting the $35 mark and so I agreed to get the bag.  It turned out that the bag was another promotion, and that my free gift was actually a Hooters girl calendar...from 2010  :IAfter buying all of the cute Hooters gear for my wife to wear, we went on our way.  Now that she has all of these cloths I don't have to bother going to Hooters anymore to check out the girls in the itsy-bitsy outfits.  I look forward to Val making me a Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich in one of her new Hooters outfits, and I'm pretty sure I won't go to this casino again.  There really wasn't anything special to see or do here.The following review is specifically for the "Bungalow room type" These rooms are in the attached two story building out by the swimming pool. We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street. Did not have a secure feeling as it felt like anyone could walk up from the street and have direct access to the sliding glass door. The rooms are all nonsmoking in the Bungalows so the sliding glass door was good for lover boy to go in and out for a smoke. That was the only good thing! Thank goodness I had my lover Sean with me for protection, otherwise I would have been sleeping with one eye open. We only stayed here one night as we attended an industry VIP open bar event and showing for "Purple Reign" who performs at Hooter's. We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night. This room sucked balls, and not the good kind. The bathroom tub was moldy and the water did not drain, seriously I took a shower standing in half a tub of water! The walls and floors had major mold as well. The room was very small, and had one outlet for electricity which was occupied by the lamp and TV. We had to reach behind and unplug the TV just to charge our phone, ridiculous. The towels are cheap, stained and shredding. Wow the quality is so bad it makes paper towels a better option to dry off with. The ice machine was broke, took housekeeping 45 minutes to bring us a bucket of ice. Yes! You get what you pay for in Vegas when it comes to hotel accommodations! It was $27 for the night (weekday) we stayed on a Tuesday. Crappy rooms, moldy bathrooms and no outlets for charging your cell will leave you with a stinky taste in your mouth by staying in these rooms! Hooter's is a huge let down, it is obvious they have given up and are not going to put any money into keeping this property updated. What a shame! I normally complain when something is this bad, luckily for the front desk we had partied so much and just wanted to jump in bed and get busy. I later sent an email to Hooter's "Customer Service" with the complaint details of our stay, did I get a response? Of course not...lol I knew that was a waste of time. Don't do it! Please Please I beg of you!Despite the 2.5 stars given on Yelp, we decided $42/night was a delightfully tacky, yet unrefined situation we were willing to dive head first into. Vegas served as the launch pad for our 5 day Southwest "tour," so when booking our Vegas hotel the day-of we weren't exactly worried about splurging for a Bellagio experience.  When we scrolled across Hooters shocking $42 ticket price, giggled for a moment and then said "what the hell."  We were feeling so fancy, we splurged for the tower room for an extra five bucks.The saying "wine on a beer budget" comes to mind when I decided upon my star rating for this hotel.  For $42, my top concern was two things: decent location and clean rooms. And ya know what? Hooters did a pretty darn good job in both categories. The hotel is located right at the end of the strip across from MGM, New York New York and Excalibur. The room isn't anything fancy - ha, in fact it has a few (definitely tacky) touches of Hooters with orange lampshades, knotty pine wood trim and Hooters artwork (not tatas; however, this would be more entertaining, but a sketch of a Hooters restaurant). The location is very easy to find off highway 15/Tropicana Avenue. Parking is free and plentiful.  There are times when I look for a hotel that is bubbling over with character and others when the hotel is serving one purpose: safe/clean place to rest my head. Vegas may not be my cup of tea, but Hooters will most likely serve as my launch pad the next time I'm here. Hard to beat $42 for the tackiest hotel in town.My girlfriends and I were on the hunt for a good deal in Vegas, and stumbled upon Hooters Hotel & Casino. We couldn't believe how cheap the rooms were - as long as $25 on weeknights and maybe $60 on weekends. SO much less than what you'd find on the strip. I booked 2 rooms without any problems and couldn't get over how cheap 2 rooms for 3 nights was!With that being said, we were fully prepared for a cheap hotel experience and weren't expecting anything like Caesars or The Venetian. We were pleasantly surprised at how "nice" the place was. If you need a comparison, think of a Days Inn or Comfort Inn. The main lobby has all the gambling and blackjack tables as low as $3. There are several restaurants and apparently the pool rocks, but unfortunatley it was cold so that feature wasn't open. The rooms weren't nearly as bad as some reviewers had written. Seriously, if you want a 4+ start experience, go to a 4 star hotel!The hotel is located just a block off the strip behind MGM. We ended up having to take a cab anytime we were too lazy (heels) or cold to walk the strip, but overall we still saved tons of money. It would have been nice to stay on the strip but hey, you get what you pay for.The staff is pretty nice but I will tell you, bar service at Mad Onion was super slow!Would I stay here again? Yes, if I want to have fun on a budget.Wow!  They got me good....Booked through Orbitz so it's non-refundable.  Very old bldg (slump block) with equally old carpet & sheets.  Maybe worth $45 ... Not the nearly $200 I got taken for!Please I just hope there are no BED BUGS...No way do they EVER get repeat business!This place should be condemned...Please Mr. Wynn... Buy this & level it!Yes, the rooms are old.  The internet access is extremely slow and patchy in places.  Service varies, with stellar performance by the male pool bartender (gave us a tip- of all the frozen drinks Hooters serves, the Rum Punch has the most alcohol, versus the Pina Colada which has almost none) and lacking performance by the female bartender inside the Hooters restaurant (not even a smile - what's up with that?).HOWEVER:1) Summer special when booking online - $32 for the night, not including resort fees (about $14) and taxes.  This included:a) Two free frozen alcoholic drinks b) Platter of 10 free wingsc) $10 free slots play d) $10 free "match play"2) Sign up for a free card to play in the casino (necessary for your free slots play), and you'll get another coupon for $5 free "match play" and $5 free (price of a beer) at the restaurant.3) Check in offer at the bar - a free beer of your choice if you check in on Facebook or Twitter.  Sit at the bar and everyone in your party can check in apparently.4) Sign up for text messages from Hooters, and guess what? Another free plate of 10 wings!5) Sit at the bar when it's almost show-time, and there's a possibility a hypnotist will run by and hand you two free tickets.So, overall, we made more money off Hooters during this trip than they made off us. This is my first time to Vegas, but I'm pretty sure this isn't how it's supposed to work. Definitely worth a stay if you're a fan of good financial decisions.Hooters Hotel is exactly what you think it is. The image you have in your mind thinking of an expanding Hooters restaurant into a larger casino with rooms is spot on. They serve wings 24/7 which is great. So there are some great positives...1) The casino is small but because it is not huge the smoke is kept to a minimum and you arent walking through large clouds of smoke2) Their pool is very nicely organized and great for kids3)  $29 rooms are simple and affordable. No bells & whistles except for the coffee machine and TV. Which usually doesn't matter because all you do is sleep in them4) Free parking & Valet with room . You may not think this is important but it is huge.5) Just off the strip but close enough you can walk easily6) HOT showersSome meh's1) Despite being close to the airport you really cannot hear the airplanes so dont let that be a deterrent2) The room is like your college dorm. 4 Walls, a TV, beds and a desk. I had to ask 3 times for a chair to the desk. Do not expect a refrigerator and if you want one it will be $25/night. Considering we paid $29/night for the room, we just brought coolers and used their free ice. Saved a lot of time and money.3) Our beds had no bed bugs. yay!4) Thermostats were solid5) The TV is an old Zenith style..no HDMI for cheating on the laptop with moviesFinally, of course, negatives...1) Free, albeit slow compared to what you are used to, WIFI2) Resort fee of $15/night NOT included in booking.com regardless of what booking said (this is for the wifi, parking)3) Not a lot of hang out options and no buffet option4) Cell service in the rooms is terrible. I was gonna cheat on the wifi by hooking up my cell to the lappy but it got worse coverage. Again you probably dont care since you wont be in the room too often5) DO NOT believe booking sites. We asked for a king bed and got 2 queens. Here is the real thing: it's $29/night .So if you are looking for an inexpensive place to crash and plan on doing things elsewhere, this is a good deal. If you are looking for the extras like a spa or resort you will be very disappointed. Great for kids..great for singles..terrible for the rich & famous.The only thing that I give a five star to at this establishment was the pregnant hooter chick that  just served me my hot wings. For serious though.. she was pregnant as hell and I wish I got a photo with her and my crew. The rooms are very outdated with no HD TVs, good luck hooking your iPad up. It's our first night and if I don't update this post saying we got bit by motherfucking bedbugs, then the beds are safe. Wish me luck folks.Spent last weekend at Hooters for the first time with a large group, and had an unexpectedly great time! If you can get a good deal on the rooms, it's a pretty sweet value (check on Groupon or Priceline). I highly recommend asking for a King room if you're only traveling as a pair - the Double rooms are considerably jankier, no idea why. Spent one night in each and it was like night and day. It seems to be overlooked by many reviewers what the theme of this hotel is. Yes, hooters, but also cheesy 1980's decor - the clock radios your parents have, the Zenith TVs, and the wood-paneled headboards are part of the kitsch. Were you expecting the Wynn? LOL You're in *Hooters*! The girls are still wearing white sneakers and orange shorts, for crissakes. Speaking of which, I didn't actually see very many Hooters girls, maybe two the entire trip aside from the girls running the tables. The casino floor stays busy, even at 5 am, and people are rocking the pool during the day, even in January. A few too many families with little kids for my taste, but what can you do. Maybe Hooters has finally eclipsed Disneyland.In a pinch and with a deal, I'd come back in a second. Walking distance to the south Strip, right across the street from the MGM Grand for shows, etc., and has a couple decent restaurants inside. Check it out!Yeah this place seemed a lot dated. And if you're expecting to see a bunch of hotties walking around in orange dolphin shorts, you'll be disappointed. There is a Hooters restaurant in the "resort" but for the most part the only hotties you'll be seeing outside the restaurant will be driving a scooter, hooked up to an oxygen tank smoking a cigarette. Maybe that's your thing.Hooters hotel is a crack house with tits. The place was & still is disgusting. The room was full of cracks on the wall & our bathroom tub so was clogged,  it would fill up with dirty water when we showered. It got so bad we aventually switched crack house rooms to another some what cleaner crack house room. Eating; don't worry because the only thing ever open is the Hooters bar. Let me sum up my experience at the Hooters Hotel & Casino. While sitting at the bar a cockroach ran accross the bar, the bar tender attempted to smash it with a bottle opener. Do not stay here no mattet how good the deal is.DO NOT STAY HERE! This is one of the worse hotels I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in some pretty bad hotels. 1. The room was absolutely disgusting. Nothing was cleaned. There were chunks of hair throughout the room. There was a fake eyelash on the shower wall. There was leftover food on the desk. The mirrors had dirty finger prints all over them. The bathroom floor was not clean. I had to buy sanitizing wipes to wipe down all surface areas. 2. The room was outdated3. The hotel smelled horrible. As soon as I got off the elevator my gag reflex kicked in. I'm not sure how to describe it. The only good thing was that the staff was very friendly. However, my overall experience was just awful. I would rather have stayed at a motel 6. Anything would have been better than that hotelthe lobby and hall way smells.. but you cant blame them.. they're an older hotel.. the staff was nice.. especially one of the valet guys.. the corded phone in the room is just broken.. called a few times and they couldnt hear.. when they finally could we had asked for extra towels that never arrived.. had a hard time taking a shower.. the hot water was not hot enough and the shower made a really loud noise the whole time.. but at the end of the time.. you get what you pay for.. we didnt want to spend 150 a night at our regular spots.. it was 140 here for 2 nights! the powerball machine was really fun though..I booked this Hotel on Groupon, 8/21 to 8/23, This was the most disgusting room ever!!!Pictures speak volumes...:(If it was possible to give negative stars I would.  This place is filthy and poorly maintained.  I will never stay here again.
Da Vang=I think I had the #7 and the #41 add tofu. My friend John had the #8 and the #38 complete with fish balls....who knew...fish...had balls? Or was it the #6 and the #39. I don't know. I was distracted by the ambiance. Old tiled floors. Really funny, faux velvet art deco chairs and tables that could have used a little Windex. We were greeted immediately, sat, received water and then...well...waited and waited. I didn't want to be to rude but finally flagged someone down. You could tell this was a family run gig...dad type figure bussing tables, little kids running around with rice falling out of their mouths (seriously, it wasn't gross, but kinda sweet) and the big mama just kinda surveying the scene. Meanwhile the younger men ran the floor. Our order was finally taken and food was delivered swiftly. The spring rolls did not dissapoint....so fresh, so delicious...who needs a fried spring roll any more? The menu was so huge and intimidating I basically just pointed at something and blurted out the number. Taking the safe route was kind of boring I realize but the noodles were yummy, the veggies crisp and the tofu was amazing. I watched the other patrons (i.e. anybody that wasn't white) to see what they ordered. It was Pho all around. Next time it's Pho for Pho sure! Great experience. Would totally order a tray of those spring rolls for a party. And next time in addition to Pho I'll have Alexander C.'s fave Banh. He says it makes him horny you know!? Oh. The prices were unbelievably low! I could have paid the entire bill with change from the cracks of my sofa cushions.Pho.  I've missed it since moving to Arizona.  Tragic, I know.  Recently I became fixated on it.  Had to have it.  For a week it was pretty much the only meal I could think about.  Where, oh where to get it in Phoenix?  Lucky for me, I know people.  People who know where to go to feed my need for Pho.  Da Vang!Right when we walked into Da Vang, I knew it was going to be good.  It just looked, well, like it was supposed to.  A little worn, and more utilitarian than attractive - you know that everyone comes for the food, not the decor.The menu is pretty extensive - almost overwhelming, and conveniently numbered for people like me who would butcher the pronunciation of the dishes.  I should have taken more time to review, but I was on a mission.  A Pho-king mission and I wasn't leaving without it.To start, we enjoyed deliciously fresh spring rolls - one type with shrimp (#48) and the other with BBQ pork (#49).  Both were prepared with crisp refreshing mint leaves and went oh so well with the peanut dipping sauce.  Heaven!The beautiful big bowl of seafood pho (#12) that was placed before me was well worth waiting for.  Oh!  Shrimp, crab, squid and more!  Bathed in a succulent broth and surrounded by a hearty portion of rice-stick (thin) noodles.  Love these!  Seeing my friend's noodle envy, I surrendered a portion to add to his Pho, which came with thicker noodles (and looked awesome, too).  I like the burn, so I heated up my broth with chili sauce, sriracha, lime juice and even a couple jalapeno slices.  After a few bites my lips were on fire - perfect!My only regret is that there was no way that I could even consider dessert.  Physically impossible after all of the amazing food I had consumed.  I am sure they would have been good.  Well, I just have a reason to go back!Well worth the drive.  Da Vang, I know where to find you now, and plan on seeing you often!My friend Sage and I ate here this evening because we wanted to try some Vietnamese cuisine. I've heard good things about this place on yelp, so we decided to have dinner here. I'm sorry, but this place is sad! I hate giving 2 star ratings especially if it's a family owned business, but their service needs improvement! When we sat down, nobody bothered to check on us or even offer us water. After waiting and being ignored for about 5 minutes, we finally waved someone to give us water . Our waiter seemed a little impatient and when we ordered our drinks, the server just threw our beverages on the table, turned around and then walked away. We were like, what is his problem? Maybe he had a long day, but that's no excuse! When he finally took our order, half of the things I ordered weren't available. He kept saying they ran out and he seemed very short with me.Then why put 100 items in the menu if half of the items are not available?I am always nice to service industry, but this dude didn't even bother suggesting an alternate selection.Sage ordered a beef pho and I ordered a vegetarian noodle with tofu and vegetables. This place is not vegan friendly and all their pho is made with beef stock. Most of their dishes either contains animal tendons, pigs blood, tripe and other things i couldn't identify.   Then when we got our food, he didn't even bother to check on us to see if everything was satisfactory. I don't know why this place get 5 stars. It's not even a 5 star restaurant. It's in a sketchy strip mall and the restaurant is dirty. Stained ceilings and filthy floors. I would be scared to find out what the kitchen looks like. Sure you get good value for your money and they give you large portions, but the service and atmosphere left much to be desired.JD Invades AZ Day 3:I know what you all are thinking: you flew over 600-miles just to eat Pho? Well ordinarily you're right--I would never go to AZ to eat Pho in 90-degree heat, especially since we have World Class Pho back home in San Jose. However, my good Yelp bud, Laz C, had never had Pho before and as the unofficial Pho-King of Yelp, it was my duty--nay! Privilege to take his Pho-Cherry away. So, we did our research and Da Vàng (DV) was the most convenient Pho spot to Laz's work. So we hooked up on a sunny and warm Phoenix Spring Day. Here are our chronicles:48: Goi Cuon Tom Thit (Spring Rolls)- I was not too impressed with DV's Spring Rolls; the Rice Paper was too thick and sticky and the spring rolls themselves weren't as fresh as I'm used to. Also, instead of Peanut Sauce they served them up with a cup of Hoisin Sauce sprinkled with Peanuts. I'm not sure if that's customary in certain types of Vietnam, or what, but that's not the way we roll in SJ. 2.5*1B: Pho Da Vàng Xe Lua (Pho sliced beef, brisket, tendon, tripe, and beef meatballs): Broth- I was surprised how good DV's broth was because, to be honest, I was expecting some fake wanna-be Pho out here in the Desert where most people don't know any better. It didn't have some of the nice subtle complexity that Pho broth can have, but the beefy flavor was on point. 3.75*Noodles- Standard Pho noodles and they hook you up pretty good with the amount. Now, if they had fresh noodles I would've been way impressed, but alas you can't get everything. 3*Meat- The meat was pretty good, but they weren't very generous with it. I was too engrossed in our conversation to remember to order the steak raw on the side-- Pho-Jester is more like it. 3*44: Com Ga Nuong (Steamed Rice with BBQ Chicken)- I ordered this for my 3-year-old and was surprised he ate the tomatoes and most of the chicken. He's pretty picky so I'll have to rate it based on his discerning palate. 4* (Lance rating)Service & Ambiance- Pretty standard Pho service in that you get the minimum number of visits to your table, but at least they were friendly and didn't grunt at us. DV is located in a pretty suspect Phoenix neighborhood; I wasn't 100% sure, but Laz confirmed it as I guess he used to live close by once upon a time. With that being said, it wasn't super-ghetto, but ghetto enough to add to the charm. 3.5*-service/4*-ambianceValue- I was surprised how cheap the Pho prices are here compared to SJ; where a bowl of Pho is averaging around $8, DV's average price is around $5. Great value for what it is. 5*I'd like to thank Laz again for letting me be his guide into the world of Pho and for being a fantastic dining companion. As for DV, I'd say they deserve an overall 3.5-star but I'll give them the 4-star bump because I was pleasantly surprised for AZ and they have a tremendous value.
