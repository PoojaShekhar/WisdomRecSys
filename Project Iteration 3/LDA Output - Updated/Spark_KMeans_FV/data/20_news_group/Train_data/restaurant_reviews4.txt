Review Text :
I began my love affair with Ethiopian food last year when I went to visit a friend in New York and he opened my eyes to the delights of this interesting, yet amazing food.I'm not sure if I can actually classify it a "love affair" being that I have only been three times now, but it is what it feels like. With my recent gluten allergy, it has been terrible finding carbs and luckily the Injera bread is 100% gluten free (it is made with teff) so I can eat to my hearts desire!Another really neat thing about Blue Nile is that they serve a small raw menu every day, and a full blown raw menu on Sunday and Monday. I don't know of anywhere else in the valley that does this, so definitely a great thing to see! I cannot wait to come back and try their raw creations. That is, if you can pull me away from the injera :-)Now, the one drawback that ALMOST turns this place from a 5 to a 4 is that they have the scariest parking lot I have ever seen. I made Dallas G. watch me walk back to the car, in broad daylight, just to ensure I was not accosted. Well, that, and I have a great ass ;-)Oooo and they have this magical tea that has such a unique flavor. I absolutely love it!Extremely affordable, very tasty, great service... WINNER!!!!!My first introduction to Ethopian food, and I can remember it like it was yesterday.  It's interesting and unusual, but nothing about it could be offensive.  It's just not *that* weird, despite how it looks and the way you eat it.  I don't know if I would recommend going for your first time w/out someone who's been before.  I wish it was served at a higher temperature and that the men's room had been stocked w/ paper towels, but otherwise I have no complaints and look forward to returning.  As a side note, the hummus here is excellent, and I would recommend starting with it if you're a little nervous about the whole idea.

Review Text :
Alessia's is the biggest disappointment I have found on Yelp. After seeing all the great reviews, I had been wanting to try this place for some time. With so many 5 star reviews and a number of people on here raving about the freshness and quality of the food, I had high hopes. Unfortunately Alessia's didn't live up to the hype. The service was very slow, which I won't hold against them. Most people were sipping wine, so maybe it's their intention to slow it down a bit. The bread is garbage. Probably the worst part of my night there. It tasted like they went across the street to Basha's and bought some rolls that they heated up in the microwave. A good Italian restaurant has to have good bread. The rest of our meal didn't get much better. The pasta we ordered was disappointing. Small portions, small taste, big cost. Definitely not worth the price we paid or the time we waited. The reviews I read did not describe the food I ate. I understand if you love Alessia's for the atmosphere, the wine or maybe because it's hard to find a place like this in Mesa, but the food I ate did not deserve 4.5 stars. It was bad enough that I have no intention of giving Alessia's a second chance. Not the worst I've ever had, just the most disappointing. One last gripe I have is the service. The bad jokes and cheesy Italian don't fit with everything else this place is trying to do. The guy did know his stuff, but he was slow and made me feel awkward more than I'd expect.I am blown away by this little diamond in the rough! This quaint little restaurant is tucked back in the corner of a strip mall in Mesa. I have heard a lot of whispers about this place and had to check it out myself! Absolutely amazing! The restaurants atmosphere is so peaceful and relaxing you can't help but enjoy yourself as soon as you walk through the lit court yard into the front door greeted by smiling faces. The staff is very friendly and the owners actually work here. It's owned by a husband and wife, the wife is the chef and the husband runs the front. Very promising future for this little restaurant, as for the owners love what they do and work very hard at making their customers happy. They are very caring and personable with each customer; you don't see this kind of attention in businesses now a days! They have a great menu; our food was fresh, authentic, mouth watering.... Great selection of wines....... make sure to leave room for dessert! Definitely left with my big ol food baby!! John and Shari expect to see us back very soon! Thank you for such a wonderful evening!My husband and I live close by and decided to try Alessia's. When we walked in we were greeted by the bartender who said the hostess would be right back. We waited a few minutes and she never came. I was hugging my husband and this waiter decided to come up behind me and say hello as if he were going to seat us. I immediately let go of my husband only to find that he was just saying hi. The hostess still was not there so after a minute the waiter seated us and told us to sit where ever we wanted. So what was the point of waiting at all??? Anyways...We browsed the menu and noting really seemed that appetizing to me. My husband asked the waiter how big the portions are for the fettuccine alfredo. The waiter looked at my husband like he was an idiot for asking such a question and said, " I don't know, like average?  Does that make sense?" My husband was pissed, but blew it off as to not ruin the evening. We ordered the fettuccine alfredo to split which came with a salad. The salad was good, but the alfredo tasted like EASY MAC! I would have sent it back, but I didn't want to make my husband feel bad because he chose the restaurant and I was hungry. The alfredo wasn't enough food, so we decided to order calamari from our SECOND waiter. Yes, they have multiple waiters as if they are TRYING to be a FIVE star restaurant, which they are not even close. Then our FIRST waiter came back to ask us if we wanted dessert, when we had just ordered something. I just think it is unorganized and confusing to have five different waiters. I felt like no one knew what was going on and that we kept getting interrupted. Normally at Italian restaurants the calamari is fried, but not here. They set it in front of us and I was horrified. I did not want a nasty rubbery ring tomato soup. We sent it back and decided to just forget ordering anything else. We received our bill and noticed there was a $4 charge for "splitting" the EASY MAC. This place is such a rip off. We paid $18 for a two small bowls of EASY MAC. We did not see on the menu that there was a charge for splitting meals because if we had we would have not split a meal. I will never in my life come back to this place ever again!

Review Text :
What is up with people who like Schlotzky's Deli? My family thinks it's good. That when you put their pizza or sandwich in your mouth, the experience is enjoyable. They are wrong. It's as far from enjoyable as I am from traditional. And even though they are wrong, it's all fine and good... except for those rare occasions when I don't have the choice about whether I am also forced to eat there, like birthdays. I don't want to throw my mom under the bus, because I can't even fathom what this says about her to the unknowing reader, but for her last b-day she wanted Schlotzsky's. I know. I know. It's just so bad. What do you like? The sandwichs? That ridiculous bread? 30,000 cucumber slices? The pizza is so banal I can't even comprehend... Everyone likes artichoke hearts but it can't just be that on a veggie pizza. You must also include flavor. But people like it! I do not get it on any level. I want to... I just don't. I actively dislike writing bad reviews.

Review Text :
Charleston's is really close to my house and been wanting to try this place. Very curious. Very none assuming place. We walked in tonight and there was a 25 minute wait. Argh. Small waiting area and noticed that there were a lot of elderly people. Noticed that there is a bar area and a dining area. Very dark and lots of bricks. My daughter described this place as a wine cellar. Hahaha sounds just about right. So I ordered the Catfish platter and it came with two large pieces of breaded fish, cole slaw, and shoe string french fries. The catfish was cooked perfect. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Loved the fish. Really liked the cole slaw. Enjoyed it and wished they gave me more but it was very good. Fries were normal. Nice, fresh, and crispy. So overall a very good meal. My wife had the Spinach and Chicken Waldorf salad and switched out the cheese for grapes. I can't remember what was inside of the salad. I think it had strawberries, raisins, and apples with spicy pecans with a vignette dressing. The salad had a nice little kick to it. I grabbed a few bites and it was really good. My wife enjoyed itMy kids split a whole rack of baby back ribs. I got one of the ribs and it was falling off the bone. Very good ribs. Had a tiny kick to it but really good. The ribs came with two sides and they got mashed potatoes and shoe string potatoes. They ordered it with beans so the kitchen made a mistake. The waitress gladly gave them their beans. They said the mash wasn't very good but they liked the fries and beans. They were dipping the fries in the beans. So they really enjoyed their baby back ribs. For dessert, we shared a key lime pie with fresh whip cream. So good. Loved the crust. I would have to say the service was extremely good. We got our water cups really quickly and took our order. The food came out pretty quickly and our server kept on filling our water cups. She was very friendly and seemed to always have a smile which is always good. So we had a very enjoyable dinner here. Good food. Good service in a wine cellar ambience. So we'll probably be back. JD and Joyce W was there at the same time but we missed you. Next time. Enjoy and happy dining.

I can see why people eat at Joe's late night - I'll have to remember to do that next late night I'm out and craving pizza... Joe's reminds me of a place I used to go for late night slices when I was in college.  (Go Blue by the way and if anyone reading this remembers that awesome late night pizza place in Ann Arbor, please let me know).OK, back to reality and fast forward 12 years... I went to Joe's for lunch today.  I had their chopped salad and my dining companion had a slice.  I was kind of wishing I had a slice too, but I have to admit that the salad was pretty good!  It had lettuce, tomato, salami, and swiss cheese and a balsamic dressing on the side.  I would totally get it again.  Quick, cheap, friendly, and satisfying - how can you say no to that?!I'll be back to Joe's for sure!Found the joint on Yelp and stopped in for some lunch.  I was hungry, so I ordered:2 Slices of Cheese Pizzahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=DLRrNqxUOi4C-ZruqGljlA1 Slice of Tomato Basil Pizzahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=DK3o6jLbbW2Ot3ZSAxZ7lQIt's touted as a New York Style Pizza joint and it is....the Pizza is thin crust and you must fold to eat!  Otherwise the Pizza bends down....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=obcx6HaVezeOz9Duw6_sTwI thought the Cheese Pizza slices were a solid 4 Stars.  They had a nice flavor to them and weren't greasy at all.  However, the Tomato Basil Pizza was not good....2 Stars at best.  The Tomatoes didn't have much flavor and tasted a little "off".....was not happy with that choice.Total damage was around $8 and it included a bottle of Water.  Not bad for 3 Slices.  Next time, I order just Cheese slices.Return Factor - 60%Time for an update and a bump in star rating too...It was my daughter's second birthday and we celebrated our house on a Sunday evening.  I put out appetizers and made a couple of salads, but how can you host approximately 20 people and not serve pizza for a kid's birthday party?!  I used the Eat 24 App and ordered that afternoon.  I love the feature that you can select a later delivery time.  I selected 5pm and ordered the following:-Vegetable Pizza + eggplant (highly recommend adding that eggplant; it was awesome!)-Meat Pizza-Plain Thin Crust 20" Pizza-40 Wings - (Buffalo style with ranch)I was able to add tip to my order when I placed it so I didn't have to worry about tipping the delivery guy.Everything arrived on time and hot... and was demolished by my guests.  I had a slice and more than a few wings as well, and it was worth the calorie splurge for sure!So, bottom line is that Joe's is great for lunch, for delivery, and for late night bites as well.  I'll definitely be back soon!

Review Text :
I miss Jewish delis in LA. Nate and Al's, Brent's Deli, Canter's, etc.This is THE closest thing. I stopped in one morning when I was craving a heavy breakfast. I got the everything bagel with nova and cream cheese. For the first time in my life, I had a choice between Lox and Nova. If you don't know the difference, google it. The Nova and Lox are priced per lb, and its a bit pricey, but who cares. You get what you pay for.I am glad this place is down the street from my office. I'll be back!This place was fantastic, I would have given it 5 stars except for without any notice about a year ago (it has been a while since i last went as i dont frequent vegas much) they changed their cabbage soup recipe. It used to be the BEST cabbage soup i have ever had in my life. It was the reason I went here. It was thick delicious tomato goodness with the best cabbage ever. Now it is the most bland disgusting watered down garbage ever. I have not been here since and do not plan on going back. I actually asked the chef who makes the soup and he said they made him change the recipe for whatever reason and he agreed he liked it better before too. I asked one of the hostess too and they said it was because a customer complained it was too thick or something.I wanted to love Harrie's Bagelmania. I didn't! There is a scarcity of New York style bagel shops in Las Vegas. The only three that I know of are Bagel Cafe (Summerlin), NY Bagels (downtown), and Harrie's Bagelmania.  Harrie's Bagelmania is in an economically challenged neighborhood. I was surprised to see the exorbitant prices that are disproportionate to the average income of the area and the highest prices that I have seen a bagel restaurant charge. Nearly $15 for a bagel with lox Sandwich!? Your kidding Me! Nearly $9 for a bagel with egg salad! This is before paying for a beverage.   I opted for the bagelwich with a fried egg and ham. This is one of the reasonable priced items on their menu. Interestingly the only style of egg listed was fried. What about scrambled?  I wasn't too crazy about the bagelwich. When I taste a bagel, my expectation is that it is hot and soft. This bagelwich fell short of my expectation. The ham was okay. As far as the coffee it was also okay.   I was satisfied with the service. The waitress was on top of my coffee refills at the same that she was pleasant. When I paid the cashier joked over the  change being an unlucky number. I easily rectified that when I left the waitress a tip for good service.   I don't love Harrie's Bagelmania. To be honest I left disappointed with the exorbitant pricing and bagelwich that fell short of my expectations yet satisfied with the service. My Harrie's Bagelmania check-ins stop here.Much like the Bagel Café on the west side of town, Harrie's serves bagels and deli classics in an old-school diner-style setting. Portions are generous and good-quality product results in surprisingly high prices: my bagel sandwich with lox set me back an absurd $15. I will say that it was loaded with a lot of lox, but maybe normal portions and prices would be more appealing... Other than that, the bagel itself was underwhelming, toasted to a hardness that was difficult to bite into, and just wasn't particularly flavorful aside from the toppings.Bagels are available in individually or in bulk, toasted or not, with or without schmear and other toppings. Shop only offers choices of regular or scallion cream cheese. Potato pancakes, knishes, blintezes, and other Jewish deli staples available as well as meats by the pound. I still prefer BC, but this isn't a bad option if you're on this side of town.

GROUPON SCAM PLEASE READ:UPDATE 11/9/2013 YELP deleted my photo of the container of chicken tikka masala next to a can of coke. The picture shows the size of the container, smaller than the size of a coke. This was my order, my experience so YELP is being an ass to remove my photo.On to the review:This place was a total SHAM. We bought the $25 for $12 take out Groupon. We showed up and asked for a menu (no menu from Kohinoor online, not even on their Facebook. SCAM) , they said they had no menu, WHAT? After asking a couple times the owner said to someone else "get the menu" and cocked his head. They managed to come up with a ridiculously priced menu after being there for 10 minutes. $12.99 for chicken tikka masala with no rice or naan. The Biltmore doesn't even charge these prices.We are a regular of Curry Corner literally a stones throw away and the owner starts talking crap about Curry Corner. At CC you get the tikka masala, rice AND add garlic naan for $10. Anyway you don't eat chicken tikka masala without rice or naan (and no other restaurant we have ever been to HASN'T offered it) so my husband ordered this for me (it came to $20 here!!!!!) and his Lamb Biryani ($12.99). When the food comes and the owner shows my husband the food my husband is shocked SHOCKED he is charging $12.99 for what CC charges $8, then the owner tells my husband that CC sells a smaller size, that my husband could go to CC right now if he didn't believe him. WHAT!!!! We eat there once a week! I get the same thing @ CC and we would know what size they give us!My husband is Arab and is talking to the owner who is totally swindling my husband. He gives my husband a small mango yogurt drink and then he goes on to tell us that if we stop going to CC and go to his restaurant that he would sell us the buffet for $8.99 and our kids would eat free (they are 26 months and 9 months).  Then he takes my husband next door to the store to show him the halal meat (is this when they put the buffet food in the take out containers or take the buffet food to the back and make chicken tikka masala and biryani out of the buffet spread? No proof but I wouldn't doubt this).So my husband said ok, he paid for our food difference $8 and left.When we got home, his biryani was BEEF not lamb. There was no mix up, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and my husband was talking to the owner the entire time.This was a HORRIBLE Groupon experience, and a total scam, offering a take out Groupon for $12 for $25 worth of food and then offering ridiculous prices and claiming they don't have a menu.BY THE WAY they have a lunch buffet for $6.99 and dinner for $9.99 WITH CTM, samosas, rice, naan etc, so prey tell me how they are selling chicken tikka masala TO GO for $12.99 with no rice or naan?My husband threw out his biryani the beef was inedible (chewy and old, the dish was room temperature) and then he ended up eating leftover bbq pulled chicken sandwich that I made yesterday. I took pictures of my CTM and the container is smaller than the size of a can of coke. CTM was room temperature (it should have been HOT) edible, not good, but not bad  but I wouldn't go back if it was even $5.In the real world we pretty much got $10 worth of food (inedible BEEF biryani) and we paid $20.

1 Star for this Rainbow/Tropicana location. Service was horrible...the cashier was slamming the cashier drawer as if she was pissed off at the world and had a permanent frown on her face as if she were smelling burning hair from her upper lip! Waited 18 minutes on a Tuesday at 3pm for 1 lousy pepp/sausage pizza. We ordered 2 orders of crazy bread, one bag was burned, looking more like the color of pretzels, you know crazy bread should not be that color! Why the moron that baked that bad batch had the nerve to bag it up is beyond me. I got home and called to speak with a store "Supervisor" spoke with Cody who says "Yeah our oven is retarded and makes a lot of bad batches of our crazy bread, it is hit and miss" I will replace your next order at no charge. Um ok... and had no response regarding the bad service from his coworker as stated he was not there, he just got on shift at 4pm.Calling Cody and complaining was useless, he just rushed me off the phone and was clear he did not give a flying puck! This location is the only one in the las vegas valley I have to always sit and wait forever for a freaking pizza. Also the only location with employess who have the personality of Prisoner's waiting their turn in death row. I am not a fan of their cheap, bland and flavorless pizza in the first place, I only come here at the request of my baby sister (26) who happens to like their pizza, ugh. Next time I will put my foot down and say hell no to "LITTLE SKEEZERS" I am through with this location...done done done, enough said! To the crew at this location, you can all go to hell, you all have a bad attitude every single time! Yes, it is clear you hate your job, don't make me suffer for your employment decisions!Bite Me!

Restaurant name  Lon's At the Hermosa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My fiancee and I visited Lon's at the Hermosa on a Friday night in June to celebrate our anniversary and was a perfect location for a little romance under the calm, star-cloaked Arizona sky in a pocket of wilderness within the sprawling Phoenix metro. Lon's provided one of the most inspired meals I've had in quite a while, beginning expeditiously with a world-class wine list, representative of various renowned grape-squeezing regions as the Pacific Coast, Italy, France, Argentina, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand.  After a quick consult with a very capable sommelier who spirited us with an impressive explanation of Portuguese reds, we agreed on a bottle on Golfo [?], which may or may not be the correct name, as it smartly inoculated us after two and a half glasses each.  Mmm!In place of a starter, we ordered two unique salads: Mine was a seared duck salad on baby greens with toasted pine nuts an a white vinaigrette.  It was ingenious ... but not quite as ingenious as the scallop salad my fiancee had.  They were absolutely the best-prepared scallops either of us had ever experienced.What is even more amazing is that the salads were surpassed in flavor by the entrees, which sometimes flops as a headliner to gourmet starters.  Not the case here.  My sun dried tomato crusted rack of lamb was prepared excellently and the crust paired with the tender, juicy lamb chops (4) was easily skyrocketed into the top 3 list of things I've ever tasted.  The goat cheese herb grits were a perfect, and light compliment .. and something I've truly never seen on a menu before, much less experienced by taste.  My fiancee's grilled filet of salmon with blackberry barbeque glaze was very much an original as well.  Even for someone who is not a gigantic fan of salmon, such as myself, really enjoyed the complexity of flavors.  She very much enjoyed it.For dessert, we had the sorbet sampler as a means of cooling off from our frenetic eating/drinking pace.  Although very delicious, it was a mistake on my part as there was a sampler of tiramasu/creme brulee/pote de chocolate.  Ugh.  What was I thinking bypassing this delicious plate of hyperglycemia?  Well, there's always next time.It also must be noted, the stellar service we received.  The server was absolutely charming, gracious, and accommodative, referring to us by name, refilling our water/wine glasses, and supervising small touches like fetching the sommelier and informing the pastry chef that it was our anniversary [with that information, they gave us a chocolate script 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate - nice touch].Overall, it was a place worthy of a very special occasion, and one which I would not hesitate to return to so that we can experience the rest of their impressive menu.Restaurant Week makes writing reviews complicated. Restaurants lower their prices during this 7-day period (a three-course meal runs you $29 per person) in order to gain new customers and fill spots during less-popular dining times. At places like Lon's or Cowboy Ciao, guests end up getting meals that would normally cost $50 or more per person for a mere $29. Knowing that I got a much-more expensive meal at a bit of a discount definitely makes me want to give Lon's a higher rating. At the same time, however, my husband and I were discussing that we would have been disappointed with our experience *had we paid* twice the price. And since people reading this review may not have the good fortune of going to Lon's during the RW, when prices are lower than normal, I'm going to have to give the restaurant 3 stars. This is based on the food not being that flavorful or impressive given the prices they normally charge. We started the meal with Absolut martinis, which were pricey at $12 each and contained vermouth even though we asked for them "dry." Since we, just like Joel L, thought that spare ribs was a strange starter but both wanted to try them, we decided to pick a starter off the regular menu. We both love duck, so we ordered the salad with the seared duck. It wasn't great. We liked that it had pine nuts but found the dressing to be overwhelming acidic and were disappointed by the four pepperoni-shaped, paper-thin, and bland-tasting duck pieces. The disappointment continued with the spare ribs. I loved the sweet potato puree that accompanied them but found the ribs themselves to be a bit dry and not all that flavorful. The "carrot jus" was not detectable (or if it was, didn't add much), and we were dismayed to see that the listing for the same ribs on the regular menu said that the meat came with "ancho chile chocolate sauce." How sad that the RW version of the ribs didn't have the opportunity to be dressed up in a more flavorful sauce!For my entree, I ordered the pan-roasted scallops with the roasted pepper spaetzle, organic spinach, and the corn jus. My husband doesn't care for scallops much, but I found them to be well-cooked and not too metallic or gritty (as bad scallops can be). The sides, especially the spaetzle, were interesting and pretty flavorful. I could definitely taste that the spinach was organic. I also had a glass of wine with my entree and did appreciate the pairings listed on the RW menu next to each course, which made it easy to quickly choose an appropriate wine.  My husband had the open-faced shrimp ravioli. We both loved the concept and again, found the vegetables to be really fresh and tender. However, we didn't taste anything resembling lobster jus and found the shrimp to be pretty over-cooked. The portion was small, which we usually don't mind if the dish is high-end and super-flavorful, but that wasn't really the case here. In terms of desserts, the lemon tarte was just ok (and actually reminded me of those lemon bars you make from a boxed mix), but the chocolate truffle torte with the minted berries was outstanding. Since we weren't blown away by any of the other dishes we had tried, it was really nice to end the meal with a delicious, rich dessert. I am glad to have had a romantic meal in a beautiful patio setting for only $29 per person, but again, we would have been quite disappointed with Lon's food had we gone and paid regular prices for everything ($25+ for the shrimp ravioli would have been the most disappointing).  That being said, I can't reiterate how peaceful and unique the patio setting is, and the service was certainly professional and attentive (the bus boys did an especially nice job of keeping the table clean and re-filling water glasses). The atmosphere and service may make me want to go back at some point (maybe on someone else's dime!) and give Lon's food another try. One final note - Lon's does take reservations through OpenTable.com although the email confirmation requested that we call the restaurant directly in order to secure patio seating, so I would suggest making direct contact with the restaurant if it really matters to you to sit on the patio.This place is Fn amazing. The boy took me here for my birthday dinner, and literally, I cannot think of any other place I would have rather been at. We went late, 9pm rez, It was an amazing evening so we sat outside near the fireplace. You seriously have to sit outside, it's almost like you're in another state on vacation with how secluded it is. Each table gets its own heat lamp too, by the way. We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool. Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude. We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing. The mussels were delicious.. I LOVE mussels, and ever since I left Boston, I haven't had any good ones.. these were awesome. I wanted more. The Foie Gras was obviously delicious..  Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds. For our entrees, I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin. For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus. I'm not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates. We devoured everything, and all of it was perfect. Especially the bottle of wine we split with it.To wrap up the meal, we got the crème brulee to share, and as my photo shows, they personalized it for my special day. That along with 2 glasses of port, and we were good to go.. Staff don't mess around, they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet. I will say this place is not cheap, and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions, however, I will absolutely go back again and again and again, birthday or not. Seriously one of the most delicious dinners ive ever had, period.Sushi grade Ahi served on a 500 degree block of Himalayan sea salt.A lone short rib, cubed, perched atop a bed of braised root vegetables. So majestic looking, it reminded me of a sentinel on lookout.A hangar steak (flank) cooked to perfection.All three shared two common themes:Both the presentation and sodium levels were immeasurable.I love Lon's. I want to show them off to my friends from out of town. I love their wine cellar...it's dungeon-esque type features.I want to eat there on special occasions because I know I won't be disappointed.But this trip had me rethinking everything I know about Lon's and that's saying something since I've been going there for many years now.The gravy on the hangar steak was inedible it was so salty. My girls secretly wiped it all away so as not to create a stir with our server, knowing I would send it all back and give him a couple of what-fers in the process.My short rib was braised perfectly, however, it was dry and lean. Not what I was hoping for.And the pre-dinner bread basket had the most delicious looking chips, also inedible due to the extreme salt content.Stay out of the bar.I ordered a Crown Royal Manhattan.I was informed they don't serve Crown Royal, but some bullshit well whiskey called Buffalo Trace. Seriously, who doesn't serve Crown? I expected Lon's to serve Crown Black for Christ's sakes.My wife ordered a Mai Tai. It was undrinkable.Lon's, here's some advice from the cheap seats.Stop believing your own press clippings and take a long hard look in the mirror.At the very least, hire an executive chef whose cravings for salt doesn't rival a 14th century sailor sporting a goiter the size of a basketball.I've never actually eaten here so I'm not sure how amazing the food is and I will not be finding out any time soon. Here is my experience...I walked into the restaurant for dinner and there was no one in sight. The maitre dee asked my name for a reservation and i stated I was a walk in. He said...let me see what I have but you may be sitting in a room by yourself. He proceeded to say, "let me see to these guests and then I'll try to seat you!"  An older couple was still outside walking up that he felt where a priority over finding me and my guest a table. As I was standing in the doorway completely embarrassed in front if my guest and thinking about how demeaning the person was I walked out and decided not to eat here. This place may have amazing food and amazing cocktails but I was not able to get past the service.  I will not be going back nor would I ever recommend someone subjecting themselves to that kind of treatment.My boyfriend and I came here for a special occasion. He had gotten a promotion at his new job within 3 weeks of working there..Amazing right?! Oh, Which he had no idea where i was taking him, nor had a surprise for him.. We got lost on the way there. Because of the the constructions. I was sooo lost, thinking this hotel should not be in a neighborhood area, haha but it was.  Just keep driving.  :)We had the three course meal. Everything was a la carte. I had the Hermosa salad. I love the fruity sauce that was in the salad. also the mash potato was very creamy and boy do I want some more. Boyfriend had steak, or did he had pork? I forgot.. he absolutely loved it.The dessert came out, I had called in advance and specifically told them to keep the dessert part a surprise. They did a wonderful job. They even came out with a congratulation card, and the staff signed it. So personal, yet what a kind gesture that was.I'll be back here again. Thank you Hermosa staff!!MEN: READ MORE FOR AN EASY DATE IDEA! My boyfriend surprised me with a simple Happy Hour date night here the other night. He came home, pulled me away from my computer and insisted that we head straight to a surprise location. His goal was to watch the sunset but unfortunately their gorgeous patio was pretty secluded and we couldn't really see it. However, I must say that it was still the most romantic date spot!! It was literally a sanctuary. They had relaxing live music that started at 6 PM (you may want to call first to confirm if they will have it on the night that you decide to go), fire pits everywhere, candles, white lights strung throughout, $6 drink specials and $4 bar snacks with other delicious appetizers (Their chips, salsa, and guac were heavenly!). An appetizer trio that comes on a pretty dish was $15. Beyond the drinks and apps, this place is sure to send your significant other's heart wild. When we left, I felt like I had just relaxed all day at the Spa! Here are their daily specials!: http://hermosainn.com/lons/last-drop-bar/events/happy-hour.shtml

Review Text :
It was a rainy day in Vegas. It was the type of weather that made everything dark & gloomy and all you want to do is stay inside and watch a movie and eat... I came in here to grab some Chinese take-out and headed home before it started pouring.There wasn't too much excitement going on in the dining section, but it was a little crowded in their waiting area. The chairs were placed so close together that it can be a little awkward when waiting for your food to be ready.I ordered the egg fried rice and the beef with broccoli. There isn't really anything spectacular about this place. I guess the portions they give out for a lower price than some other take-out places in the area are what makes the trip here worth it. It's pretty much what you would expect from a Chinese take-out place. I would come again because it has great prices for the amount of food they give you.

Review Text :
Dear Goldilocks,I waited to get a yummy drink JUST because I knew we were headed here after our breakfast at the Chowking down the street. Apparently you folks are not so consistent from location to location. Being from Cali and privileged to have tried your Avocado shake... I was super eager to have one in Vegas. Of course the people @ the counter thought I was crazy. Whatever! I guess the only thing going for this location is the all you can eat breakfast for about 5bux that was posted on the door. Please make the appropriate changes with what you read from me & other Yelpers!Respectfully, Kriss P.2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #10Our Halo-Halo Challenge stops at 10 locations, with Goldilocks as our last contender.  We decided early that Goldilocks would be last because they have been around for quite some time with 21 locations in the US, it was recommended by others, and we remember that their Halo-Halo was pretty good.  In other words, we wanted to save the best for last.  What we found was some inconsistencies to how I remember Goldilocks' Halo-Halo to be.  Cost for their Halo-Halo is $4.99. Ingredients included kaong, pinipig, nata de coco, macapuno, red beans, ube ice cream, lanka, condensed milk, and shave ice all mixed together.  Missing was real ube and flan.  Halo-Halo means "Mix-Mix" and that's what you do to eat this treat.  You start with this pretty dessert and you mix it.  But what I found at Goldilocks is that they tend to mix mix what they put in their Halo-Halo.  I've had Halo-Halo from Goldilocks from locations ranging from their Philippines, NorCal, SoCal, and now Vegas.  I swear flan and even legit ube was in their "Mix-Mix". I guess all locations are different, which left me disappointed when I didn't get what I wanted in their Halo-Halo. Overall, I still finished my Halo-Halo but would not consider theirs as my favorite.  Sorry Goldilocks, but you need flan and ube in your Halo-Halo to make me happy. Like some of the other Halo-Halo contenders, food was also taste tested.  I wanted their chicken BBQ on a stick because the pictures on the menu looked so delicious. But they were out and this wasn't the first time this happened to me.  I ended up with their half chicken BBQ with garlic fried rice.  Just a note, folks...rice is not included with their meals.  You have to order rice separate. So, don't assume you're getting it and they don't ask you either. My meal still hit the spot. My Halo-Halo was just okay, but at last their chicken BBQ was good.  PS:  We committed to ending this challenge at 10 locations. We know there's more out there (ie, Nanay Gloria's, Red Ribbon, DT's, etc).  Maybe part 2 of this challenge is in the future, maybe not.  One things for sure, we're both ready to get back to eating clean and training mean.  This Halo-Halo Challenge was a great way for me to decompress from all that damn grilled chicken breast.  2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WAContender #8 (Fiesta Filipina):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-filipina-cuisine-henderson#hrid:VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHwContender #9 (Ito'y Sariling Atin):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/itoy-sariling-atin-las-vegas#hrid:X3FQeLTQycMELQ66wgpvIQThis is for the bakery and the restaurant. Our family had lunch here for the second time, we were running errands and we got hungry and we felt like Filipino food. I wouldn't crave for their food and go out of my way just to eat here. Everything was ok, siomai was ok, the sisig was cut too big, I like my sisig in tiny little pieces and crunchier. The fried was good, I would order that again if we are ever caught hungry and in the area. I would also order the dinuguan again but that's because I always have to have that when we eat at a Filipino restaurant. I like the sauce all over my rice (no dinuguan meat for me) and since I refuse to learn how to cook this specific dish (I refuse to touch the blood, even though I deal with blood on a daily basis. Don't ask!), I make sure to order when the opportunity is there . Now for the bakery, this is the reason why I give them 4 stars, otherwise it would be 3. Their pandesal is soft and creamy and their sans rival is the best I've ever had. It's my son's favorite, I've tried other places and we always end coming back at Goldilocks for this once or twice a year treat. Also make sure to try their mocha roll, they are known for this cake! To wrap up this review, if you're hungry and want Filipino food, there's a cheaper restaurant across the street by Smiths called Sariling Atin. Then when you're ready for your dessert, head to the Goldilocks bakery.Pinoy baked goods galore! Inside, Goldilocks doubles as a bakery and restaurant (half of the room is the bakery section, while the other half is the dining area) that offers traditional Filipino dishes and pastries. The aroma of freshly baked bread and Filipino cuisine envelopes you once you step in, which is pretty inviting.In general, Filipino pastries tend to be sweet and filling so picking up a few things was enough to satisfy my midday sweet tooth. I feel like they didn't have a huge selection of goods to choose from, but the staples to any Filipino bakery are there including: ensaymada, mamon, cuchinta, etc. I ended up getting the baked cheese rolls and the ensaymada with ube (a brioche roll with a sweet, purple yam filling). The cheese rolls were the same texture as a traditional pan de sal roll (with fine bread crumbs lightly sprinkled on top), but this baked good was sweeter in flavor. The ensaymada with ube had the sweet, yet buttery taste.One thing I like about these specific pastries is the fact that the cheese incorporated in them compliments the sweetness; it doesn't have an overbearing "cheesy" taste -- it's more subtle and may be unnoticed because of the pastry's sweetness.I was pretty satisfied with the goods that I bought because they were soft and filling. It's what I expect out of a perfectly baked Filipino pastry.

Review Text :
The best DT location in town! Old school locals know what this building used to be and we welcomed DT when it took over and decided to make its presence known (incorporating menu items from the previous business) in Vegas years ago. Yes the location is smaller but the building is older. They have never messed up my order here and it's always hot and delicious. The manager has been there a long time and gets to know her regular customers. She welcomes you like family no matter if you come inside or use the drive thru. It's crazy that a fast food place can do that but that's what I've experienced for many years at this location. On taco nights the drive thru can get backed up but it goes by quick so don't hesitate to stop if it looks long.

Restaurant name  Dillon's Thunderbird

Review Text :
This is a meat place close to Sun City so dinner at 5 last night was quite appropriate. Dillon's is decent fresh food in a casual environment. Good for groups, efficient wait staff and big portions. The man was on a brisket kick and since this was a BBQ joint, figured he would try it. It is Kansas style and it was nice and tender BBQ-though not quite "smoked" and definitely sliced on a meat slicer.The daughter had a pulled pork sandwich that was tender and delicious. The Grandmother had a brisket sandwich, there are other offerings as well-fried chicken, chicken fried steak, fish, etc. Salads are good as are the onion rings they ordered for appetizers. This is no BBQ joint. This is a family restaurant with decent food and decent service.I am giving 4 stars again mostly due to the great service we have. For some reason, AZ is still ass backwards when it comes to recognizing waitstaff. They are not paid minimum wage (though I am not sure how this is legal). They make about $3.25 per hour from the establishment (this is up from $2.12 two years ago) and the rest is supposed to come out of tips. Any young person willing to work in the Sun City area and depend on tips and actually works really hard to get them deserves a whole star to themselves (oh and an extra tip behind the chintzy tippers in my family here).Reservations are only taken for a party of 8 or more.This place has been on my to try list since before I knew what Yelp is.  I made it my choice when I won a football bet last fall.  Yes, I know football season has been over for a while but diets, cash flow and life in general, on both sides, made this dinner wait.  Suffice it to say the company was worth the wait.When we got there about 6:30 on Saturday the parking lot was packed and we were worried we would be stuck in the bar with our growling stomachs.  It turned out we were seated immediately although there were only a few tables open.We started with a half order of onion rings.  These are hand made in house and served with a really good dipping sauce.  Both the rings and the sauce reminded me of Lenny's (which got rid of their sauce and started buying frozen onion rings) only one notch higher.  We were both thinking ribs in a BBQ joint and she got the baby backs and I got the St Louis style spare ribs.  She got the fall off the bone she wanted and I got the slightly chewy I wanted.  Of the sauces I preferred the cajun which was only mildly hot, however the ribs were good enough they really didn't need much sauce.  We both ordered different sides so we could try many of them.  We liked them all but my favorites were the cole slaw and the macaroni and cheese.  The only soso item was the dinner roll but even there they are smart enough to serve soft butter.The service was attentive without being obtrusive the entire time.  Our waitress had the answers to all of our questions without having to go ask.Sort of an anomaly in the North West valley, you can arrive here between 7:30 and 8:30 and the place will be sort of quiet between the Sun City folks and the later night crowd and be seated right away.

Restaurant name  The Golden Greek

Review Text :
Golden Greek is a diamond in the rough and I find myself craving it often.The place is one of my favorites, if not my top Greek restaurant in the valley.All of the food is made from scratch and absolutely delicious. I think I've liked pretty much every single food item that I've tried there, the hummus & pitas, the greek salad, the spankopita, the pasta de greco. Love all of it.The service can be slow at times, but the fantastic food is definitely worth the wait. Prices are low, so the meals are easy on your wallet. If you want some spectacular Greek food, this is the spot for you.Earlier in the week one of my customers from Wickenburg mentioned he had just come from lunch here and when he lived in town it was a regular stop for him.  So I Yelped it while he was here and found not a single bad review.After a disappointing time at the MVD I needed to treat myself to something good.Ambiance - OK so this is not a place to impress a date.  It's a bit, OK a big bit, dated.  But it is really clean.  A total of 11 tables and 3 of those could be moved and joined for a party of 10-12.  Most of the customers were regulars for a Friday lunch and 5 tables were in use.  The waitress (owner?) doesn't smile much but she is pleasant.Service - After being asked my party size I was told to pick a table.  As soon as she had finished serving another table she brought over my service and a menu.  She gave me a couple of minutes and then came and took my order.  When my iced tea was running low she appeared at my table with a pitcher.  There is a quiet relaxed feeling to the whole place and if you go with that vibe you will find the service to be quite good and actually faster than it feels when checked with a watch afterward.Food - This is the fourth star!  I had Chicken Apollo, chicken breast with sauteed spinach, feta cheese on fresh baked bread.  The bread as listed is pita but it is something different and better.  It came with a "small" Greek salad that took up a good portion of the dinner plate with basic iceberg, large chunks of tomato and cucumber and a couple of Greek olives topped with feta cheese and an oil/vinegar dressing. With iced tea and tax the bill was $8.93.Definitely a place to put on the list for more visits to try other menu items.I love family owned establishments. I just ate here for the first time. It was great!! By far the best Mediterranean food I've had in Phoenix. The quality of the service and food was excellent. The food was presented well, very tasty and enough portion size to leave me walking away stuffed. I was joined by my wife Carol, my 22 year old grandson Michael and our friend Kathy R.Kathy R. had eaten here before. In fact she has been coming here for years. She said at one time or another she has tried everything on the menu and just loves their food. Today she ordered the Moussaka. Which she aid was toasty, & creamy. (Basically Moussaka is a lasagna without the noodles, the eggplant in it  adds the right amount of bitterness to balance out the great, intense flavor of the sauce.)Although I didn't try a bite it looked great. Michael got cheese raviolis and an antipasto salad. He didn't say much about either dish but they looked good to me. My wife & I got the Pork Souvlaki (Tender chunks of pork served over rice). My wife ate her plate clean which she rarely does so I know she liked her meal. She told me when we got home she wants to go back there so that told me she really enjoyed the food.Like I said for my dinner entrée I ordered the Pork Souvlaki . But before I did I  ordered a Greek Salad as a starter. It was much bigger than I expected for a side salad. The salad was very fresh. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were extremely tasty. I didn't know my entrée came with either a Greek salad or  Agolemono soup. Since I had already ordered and eaten a Greek salad I opted  for the Augolemono Soup (chicken stock, egg lemon soup) my soup was absolutely  outstanding!!!! All meals  also come with a vegetable of  the day and homemade pita bread. You could tell the pita bread was homemade. It tasted fresh and came out hot. OMG it was delicious.I almost forgot with dinner Kathy R. wanted us to try the spaghetti with meat sauce so we could see what it was like. It was a small side dish. Kathy raved about it so I thought why not try it. My wife said she liked it and would order it. I thought it was just OK then again I grew up in Rhode Island in a very Italian neighborhood so it may have been good for a Greek restaurant but not to my taste. Back in Rhode Island the Italians and Greeks cooked many similar dishes including pasta dishes.FOOD: All of the food was great. The food was so good! I would definitely come back for more in the future.PRICE: . SERVICE:   "staff" consisted of  a mother-sister-brother team.  The mom wasn't there today. The brother sat us and brought us menus. He was very friendly. The sister was our waitress and server, she was attentive and friendly.  AMBIANCE:  A cute little family owned restaurant tucked in a small strip mall. The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely. It does look like it has been there for many years but the place is NOT as Nadia C, said "Dumpy". CONCLUSION:  We were seated immediately. Food was excellent, service was spot-on. My recommendation: if you want authentic, come here for an outstanding dining experience!!! This is a very special neighborhood ethnic restaurant.TURN FACTOR: 100%

Review Text :
I feel like I'm being extremely generous with this one.  Luckily for HOT, I had great company which made my overall rating higher than they might deserve.  3.7 stars total - based on the following...AMBIANCE - 5 starsIn a historic house with both indoor and outdoor seating, this is an amazing atmosphere; better than most of the strip malls that the valley is known for!SERVICE - 4 starsThe hostess went above and beyond by moving us from an inside table to an outside table by the fire when we had a change of heart and wanted some fresh air.  They also went above and beyond to help me find a parking spot as I didn't want my car to get towed from the lot next door like Patti B. yelped about previously.  Larissa was our server and she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  There was only one thing that was a bit disappointing when it came to service:  that she came by to take our order and I told her I needed a minute and she said she'd be right back but disappeared for around 10 or 15 minutes.FOOD - 2.5 starsLet me explain:  I chose wrong.  Do not order the Seafood Pistou.  Larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, I ordered it anyways.  It was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  The seafood didn't taste so fresh and I think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  However, Kristin C. chose right - she had the Ahi Tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to Kristin, it was fantastic!  Note to self:  order Ahi if I ever return!  Oh, and I tasted the Asian Pear Salad too - it was tasty.  So, the 2.5 star rating is an average... COMPANY - 5 stars!I'm going to allow the fact that I had a really fun dining companion bring up the average a bit here...BANG FOR YOUR BUCK- 2 starsWe had only water and perrier to drink and our bill was still kind of high for what I thought was just an ok meal... essentially 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 Perrier was over $80 out the door!I admit that this review is based on just one experience... however, because of the fact that I have no clue when I'll go back, I wanted to review it anyways!  If you go to HOT, go for the ambiance and order the tuna! :)SO many reviews already I'll try to keep it short and Sweet!Food~ I've only been for lunch, is Always Delicious, price, quality and quantity wise.Some of my favorites include Quiche of the day served with salad and fresh fruit, The Grilled Salmon and the Chicken Shawarma Salad (see pics) The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all. Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar. I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.Ambiance~ Love it, inside a cute old house or outside on the Lush and maturely landscaped garden patio.*Notes*~Make reservations for lunch or dinner just to be safe~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters~Dinner prices are near triple the lunch prices for the entrees~Ask for a bread and butter basket, chances are you'll be here awhile**parking meters have an 80min. time limit, mention this if you are having SLOW serviceI  have to give 5 stars for the foodVery, very few things in life ever reach perfection. House of Tricks, you are my lunch mecca!Honestly, if I could eat here Monday through Friday for lunch, I would. And what would I order? Their daily quiche. Absolutely. No hesitations. No second thoughts. Their quiche of the day is perfection!I've eaten here twice in a single week. Yes, House of Tricks is simply that awesome. After my 1st visit, I was craving it the very next day. So I made plans to go back that very week. I wanted to try their quiche again. House of Tricks is my absolute favorite lunch spot in Tempe!For $10, you get their quiche of the day, fresh fruit and a soup or salad. First quiche was chicken and goat cheese. Wow... That's all I could think to myself. "Wow, Alicia, this is... wow..." Second trip I had sausage, mushrooms and Gruyere quiche, which I ordered with their daily soup, a lobster squash concoction. While the soup was really, really good, I was still enamored with their quiche. And fresh fruit? C'mon. This is the stuff Lunch Nirvana is made of!House of Tricks, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you! House of Tricks, I love you! I love your quiche! You deserve every single exclamation point in the exclamation point satchel. Seriously!I would eat inside, outside, at the bar, wherever I could. Yes, I'd eat here every single day. That adds up to a $50 weekly habit... but I bet there's not one quiche I wouldn't like!The lovely Sarah G decided to bless me w her awesome presence for lunch this afternoon. I am so glad we decided on this lovely House of Tricks! Does anyone know why its called that?!?! I'm curious please tell me??!?! Soooo this should really be 4.5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow. A lot of places down here in Tempe seem that way to me. For some weird reason or another I feel like I enter the Twilight Zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time. Maybe they teach this course at ASU or maybe everyones just stoned, IDK!?!?! The soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and I dont even like ginger haha!! Sarah took a pic of the salad I had. I had the best salad EVER!!! Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad with Mango, Melon, Strawberries, Oranges, Toasted Pine Nuts, Citrus Cous Cous and Baby Field Greens with Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette. I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT!! Abso-fucking-lutely YUM-GASMIC!! The chef here is a fucking genius and I will never have enough of this place.....EVER! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server's ass to get the tables turned around quicker?? I will surely bring all out of towner's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future. Wine tasting is on Tuesdays I better move closer!! So when are we going?!?!?House of Tricks is a great place for dinner if you're looking to go out for a special occasion. It's not somewhere I'd go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two. I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I don't eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldn't even finish it - but my date didn't hesitate to finish it for me. We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If you're sitting at the tables next to the wall, I'd say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy. Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a 'no sense of urgency' kind of server - but we weren't in too much of a hurry anyway.How do I love thee House of Tricks?  Let me count the ways:1.  The cozy cottage and gorgeous bar area complete with twinkle lights make me forget I am right off of Mill Ave which is a definite plus.2.  There are plenty of delicious options at lunch and dinner for my non-meat eating friends.3.  One of the most underrated wine lists in the Valley at a far lower markup than other restaurants of its caliber in the area.  Example, several years ago before Turley blew up and became a trendy wine, I used to enjoy bottles there for $45!!!  Crazy, I know...4.  Their food is fresh and divine.  Their dinner menu changes seasonally and their creative chef always offers very inventive specials that you wish would be put permanently on the menu.  Some of my favorites are the Ahi tuna and the oh so tender Petite Filet Mignon.5.  They recently added a Happy Hour!!!!  (Multiple exclamation points because we all know I like the sauce : )  )6.  House of Tricks became the first restaurant in all of Arizona that my food snob of a mother insists I take her to every time she comes in town to visit.I have to take one star away (well, really only a half a star if I had my way) because their lunch prices are a bit steep and it upsets me that my wallet prohibits me from eating there as often as I'd like.If you've never been there, run don't walk.  It is truly a gem in one of the dullest dining parts of the Valley.I loved the setting. HOT is located on a fairly busy street, but you would never know it sitting on the patio surrounded by trees. Free parking is available at the meters after 6 pm Monday through Saturday. They have a lot of outdoor seating, I actually didn't take a peek inside other than to wash my hands before dinner. The space on the wooden patio outside is cozy (that means that some of tables are pretty close together). We sat right next to the fireplace, but they also have plenty of heat lamps to keep you warm on a chilly night. And the tables are pretty small to keep everything on them (2 water glasses, 2 wine glasses, candle, 2 bread plates, 2 dinner plates, utensils, salt and pepper, flower vase, bread basket, butter). We had to move some stuff to the top edge of the fireplace. We were still pretty stuffed from our heavy lunch so we passed on starters and decided to munch on bread and order dinner. The bread was pretty good, but the lemon poppy butter (it changes every night) was amazing. It was so light, sweet and tangy. We expected to get more of it when we asked for more bread and butter, but they just brought out plain butter. Our waitress said they had only make so much because it changes every night, so you have to ask specifically for it their special butter of the night if you want more. Weird that they were already out since it was maybe 7:30 pm. For dinner I had the ballotine of chicken stuffed with brioche foie gras stuffing (you get 3 pieces), cognac demi glace, sautéed spinach and butternut squash puree. It was heaven. And all went together perfectly. Mike had the beef tenderloin on horseradish whipped potatoes, sautéed spinach, bacon onion jam and red wine demi glace. Although he ordered it medium it came out almost well done. It was kind of hard to immediately tell the donenss when he cut into the steak (other than the texture) because it is pretty dark outside. The wait staff really should have a small flashlight and wait for you to cut into it so you can tell.  However, they quickly apologized for the mistake and promptly brought out a new plate. Mike said the meat wasn't very flavorful. This place can be pretty pricey. For just 2 dinners and 2 glasses of wine, plus tax and tip our bill came out to be just over $90. The atmosphere was nice and the food was good, but I thought it was just a bit overpriced. Heard that lunch is a better deal so I'll have to come back for that.4.5 stars Oh House of Tricks, you are a sneaky devil aren't you? Did you know I was coming? Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars! I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on. Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had! The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit. My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect! I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!Last night was the first time that I ever ate at House of Tricks.  Well, one time I had a piece of a leftover while I was drunk out of my gourd, but that just wasn't the same as actually being there and experiencing the beautiful ambience, having the plate brought to you and getting to pet the fat kitty that lives on the premises.Right now they're got restaurant week going on and for $30 bucks you can get a gnarly three course meal.  I got:  Coconut curry shrimp, Asian meatballs served over a bed of goat cheese and a dulce de leche cheesecake brownie for dessert with a cup of decaf coffee.Unfuckingbelievable.Sometimes when you eat food that is that good, something that soars into that level of greatness, it makes every dish you made that you were oh, so proud of look like a piece of shit.  Did you ever bust your ass and cook something that took all day?  Did you ever make your own turkey stock for gumbo you made and the whole affair took all Sunday and you never even went outside?  I'm sorry, but you're going to be a little depressed after you eat here because it was incredible to an absurd degree.  Dude.  Amazing.House of Tricks was a frequent on my rotation when I worked in this area. I love the ambiance this historic house provides and in a way that makes me forget that I'm in the heart of a college town. House of Tricks slightly reminds me of a restaurant I'd find in Berkley, CA or LA. It's charming, open and has plenty of seating outside. The food here is basic luncheon food such as tasty sandwiches. My favorite go-to sandwich when I visit is the Tuna. The sandwiches are hefty but it's really about the atmosphere when I visit. I will always remember the time I was eating lunch with my sister when the red hat ladies (a group here in Phoenix) walked in and overtook the restaurant. They were so cute in their red hats and they really made me realize that the House of Tricks is your quintessential "ladies who lunch" restaurant to Tempe. I suggest that everyone tries this absolutely charming restaurant for lunch sometime.6/1/11I finally made it to HoT for happy hour!  Parking is in the back- be careful parking anywhere else, as your car might get towed.  There are misters for those who like eating outside.  Since I've only been here once, and I had to eat at the bar area for happy hour, I don't know what the noise level is indoors, but it certainly seems nice in there, if not a bit cramped.  A big minus for me is that smoking is allowed outside, so I'm hoping to secure a table indoors on my next visit.Ordered the only cocktail on the menu that uses ginger liqueur (sorry, but I forgot the name), and really liked it!  It tasted light and refreshing, but packed quite a punch, so be careful-- it went down very smoothly and very fast!  Happy hour knocked off only $1, down to $9, so I suppose it's good that the bartender had a heavy hand.  ;)  As for my entree, I had the Roasted poblano, artichoke, and spinach dip, which came w/ both crostini and water crackers.  Skip the water crackers (they felt stale when I bit into them, and they're very bland) and stick w/ the crispy, nicely-toasted, and olive oil-drizzled crostini.  I did, and I ate the entire thing!  (Well, minus the water crackers.)  The base was very creamy, yet also chunky (I love foods that layer on many textures!), and I really appreciated the heat that the roasted poblanos brought to this dish.  From the moment I took that first bite, I thought that  this dish was different from any other spinach and artichoke dips I've ever tried.  Try it if you're into s/a dips, and let me know what you think of this one!The rest of the menu sounds great, but can get very pricey (salads and soups, $6-10; starters, $10-19; and entrees, $20-32).  Will try to return for lunch!I won a bid at silent auction for a $150 gift certificate to this place.  Located in Tempe and buried on the ASU Campus, this was not a restaurant that we'd normally stumble upon.  However, I am very happy that I bid on this even though I knew nothing about it...why?  Because the food here is fantastic!  Here's what we ordered:Korean Style Baby Back Ribs, $14http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA#WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZAYukon Gold Potato Gnocchi, King Mushroom, $23http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ#2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQGrilled Filet w/Smoked Cheddar Bits, Asparagus, Cabernet Sauce, Crispy Onions, $36http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ#LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQGrand Marnier Creme Brulee, $6.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ#exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQDouble Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon, $6.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA#DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SAThe Korean Style Baby Back Ribs were simply amazing!  The BBQ Sauce was sweet & tangy with just the right amount of Ginger.  Yum!As everyone who knows me knows that I love Gnocchi....the Gnocchi here is delish.  The Grilled Filet was very good as well.  But the best part of dinner was the Dessert....The Better Half had the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee, which I sampled and was very good.  However, the best of the best was the Double Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon....yes, that's right Bacon lovers!  This Dessert delivers the goods on all levels.....it's Chocolatey, Sweet, and the Bacon adds a little salty/meaty goodness that causes your palette to jump for joy....my mouth is watering right now.There were 3 things that kept me from giving this place 5 Stars:1 - Parking.  It sucks.  Jockeying for position against ASU student parking plus the customers for this place and area businesses is not fun.  They should offer a valet service up front just for customers....I'd pay $5-$10 just to avoid the nonsense.2 - Seating.  We were seated outside....not our preference, but the size of the interior of the restaurant is tiny and we were told the wait was long to sit inside.  They have a huge outdoor seating area with giant trees.  We were sat at a table for 2, the table was very small and the servers had trouble with space when we had a bottle of Wine, Appetizers, and Bread.  When then entrees came out, it was a circle jerk to rotate old plate off, etc.  The furniture is patio furniture and the pads of the seats are left out overnight, dusty.  There was a lot of bird shit on the wall next to where we were seated and fallen leaves all around us.....I was constantly worried about something dropping onto my food.  It was our decision to accept sitting outside, so it's on me.  If I come back, will definitely not sit outside, don't care how nice the weather is.  3 - Service.  It was so/so.  We had to flag our waiter down when we were ready to order Wine....a huge pet peeve of mine.  Also, had to flag him down to order our food and refill Wine and Water glasses.  I think the majority of the wait staff here are ASU students.....they look young and don't know how to provide proper service.  When we walked up, we didn't know where to go because the hostess stand is outside and isn't obvious....2 hostesses looked at us and didn't say "Hi, how can we help you" or anything at all.  It was only when we started to wander around the patio area that they said "are you looking for someone?"....LMAO, yes I'm trying to get seated in your restaurant!  Too bad because the food is outstanding.I will give it another try and see how it goes now that I know about the things to avoid.Return Factor - 75%House of Tricks was a first date spot for my husband and I, and has since become our anniversary dinner tradition. We've always opted to eat outside on the patio, which is the highlight of this charming house-turned-restaurant. Yesterday was our 2 year anniversary and we had a wonderful dinner. The kale salad was fresh and delicious. We both enjoyed the ahi and halibut entrees which were prepared beautifully. We also split a bottle of wine and the chocolate-peanut butter pot-de-creme. I don't think we've ever had an issue with service here, although they were a little lax on the water last night.....I'm such a stickler for this....It's such a wonderfully romantic location, and a local gem!

Yum, yum and yum!  A neighbor introduced me to this gem and am I certainly appreciative!  This is not a bass-thumping sushi mega-factory, but a small inviting space where the food is the feature attraction.  Everything I tried was fresh and perfectly presented.  Five stars, easy!When I was a naïve young man I used to go out and party on weekends. It was as if every Friday was the beginning of a national holiday requiring two days of intoxicated celebration. On any given night I would drop $10 to $30 on cover charges, $50 to $75 on drinks, $10 to $20 for the 2:00AM munchies and another $20 -$30 on a cab ride home. And what was I left with? A headache, some fuzzy memories and taking inventory of decisions made the night before.   Fortunately, with age comes wisdom. I have learned that a better way to celebrate life is to embrace unique opportunities and experiences.  If I am going to spend $100 tonight I am going to spend it wisely.  Eating at Toyama is a "value added" decision in my opinion.  I have gone twice now in as many weeks and both meals were fantastic.  My sister and brother-in-law joined me last Friday.  They were here visiting from California. We decided to go for broke and order the "Omakase" - chef's choice.  When it was all said and done they both agreed that a meal like this would have cost twice as much in LA.  While I can't remember every detail, some of the highlights were as follows...-        An amazing sashimi platter, with fresh tuna, yellowtail and uni.  -        Two different toro dishes. One Nigiri and one toro tartare dish.-        This incredible Spanish mackerel  sushi topped with a thin strip of sweet kelp.-        A custom roll with Thai hot sauce, tuna and avocado. Amazing.-        Salmon roe sushi soaked and rinsed the proper  way.It went on and on. Each new dish was a new indescribable flavor experience. One dish had this Japanese shisho leaf on it. We were all at the table trying to come up with a comparable flavor to describe it...."It tastes like a licorice-earthy-minty-nutmegy-etc..."...sounding like wine snobs trying to come up with just the right description, only this was food.  Really good food.  We got there early and were the only patrons for awhile so part of the amazing experience was the great conversation with our chef. We talked about golf, football, chef's knives, Santa Barbara, Japanese whisky, our favorite restaurants, etc... It was so interactive.  A great meal, a great evening... a great memory. Well worth the money.

Review Text :
Shame on me for not reading reviews before eating at this Applebee's.  Met some friends for lunch this week.  The wise choice for us was Applebee's (off Warm Springs) because it was one of the closest restaurants to my friends work.  What started as a wise choice, ended with an overall 3 star review.  If you read other reviews like I did not, you can probably guess what the issue was.  That's right, service here is amazingly slow.  My friend works in the buildings right next to this Applebees and one of our other friends works within 10 minutes.  The plan was for me to arrive and then let them know once I'm seating.  I just wish now that I ordered ahead of time, like 45 minutes ahead of time.  We ordered our food at 12 PM and by 12:35 PM, nothing.  The waitress was called over and we asked about our food.  Viola! Within 10 minutes we got our food after complaining.  This led to speed eating since both my friends had to get back to work.  Long story short, this place doesn't get packed for lunch, they are just slow for lunch.  This is also the same song and dance if you read the other reviews.  C'mon Applebee's...your customers are trying to tell you something. As for the food, I got their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I had an extra chicken breast added just for good measure.  The overall meal actually tasted pretty good, but that was just taste.  Texture wasn't so great. Both my chicken breast were a little dry. Overall, I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  I am giving them 3 stars only because I finished my plate.  Service needs to get better, at least faster.Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp:   http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2ur8pXFTFraCZnKwSEV4BA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQLovely Pair:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QHGjqvOeYqQEo01Gr6KlqQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Review Text :
Why has it taken me so long to eat at El Sombrero?!?!?! I told the owner while eating there that I can't believe I am from las Vegas (we wont get into how many decades tee hee) and have never eaten here! Well, I think I was more into the historic meaning and longest running Mexican restaurant. I set the bar too high. I did however give a try to this mom & pop establishment. The woman who said she was the owner (theresa) was actually rude. She made comments I couldn't believe. A little girl was calling her name to tell her good by and to thank her for the food and she ignored her only finally to tell her "I'm busy not now". I was heartbroken for the little girl. The place is very small inside. They have booths along the walls and tables in the middle. I would recommend calling before heading down because they aren't open every night. In fact, they are open nights on Friday and Saturday and it is just until 9 pm. We started with a "Cheese Quesadilla". So simple yet so overpriced.She also brought us some chips and 2 kinds of salsas. I have to admit, the salsa wasn't the best. I ordered a combo platter that had a "Cheese Enchilada with Onions" and a "Guacamole Tostada" which also came with the normal beans and rice. These beans weren't normal though they are thick not runny and I would like that if they just had so,e flavor. I asked for my Enchilada to be made with a flour tortilla and it was big and very yummy. The guacamole was not fresh and frozen. I don't know if that is a regular thing or if she was out of avocados. Gross. The other 2 in my group enjoyed there meals too but, agreed the salsa and rice could use some help. The rice seemed like it was leftover and re-heated. Very dry.We capped the night off with some "Sopapillas and Honey". This by far was the best part of the night. Meals range from $10 and up. They have a Beer and Wine liquor license so if you order a margarita it will be made with wine.I don't plan on visiting here again anytime soon. This is noted as the oldest Mexican restaurant in Vegas. There are certain tables that have "reserved" on them for local lawyers such as Richard Harris and a few others who escape up to 3 times a week from their downtown office to have some lunch or even conduct a business meeting.Authentic Mexican food with plenty of parking at their private parking lot. I arrived just after noon for lunch and the dinning room was full of patrons.I went with the chili verde burrito which came with beans, rice and salad. The burrito was unique BC it contain pieces of strips of green chilies and delish tender pork. The sides, chips and salsa were also yummy.I gathered from the way the family greeted the clients that this is definitely a locals joint and and the owners appreciated the support with a number of signs - Thanking clients for their support!I'll definitely be returning.

Four stars for the cheeseburger. It had been a long while since I had a Johnny Rockets burger. In fact, the last time I had Johnny Rockets was in college! However, during a recent shopping trip and movie night at the mall, we stopped by for burgers before the show. This is a delicious burger! It is juicy and has the special sauce and is just fatty goodness. It's definitely worth the visit if you're in the mood for a juicy burger on the go.

Review Text :
I want to hate Ra because, well, it's Ra. But the truth is, every time I come here I leave happy and satisfied. Being a Veggie, sushi is really hit-or-miss but I always seem to get pretty lucky here. Tonight was no exception. Everything was really full of flavor and really fresh. You are probably thinking that it is hard to mess up veggies, but I have had some bad sushi before (Stingray!!!!!!) I was stoked when I asked the waitress to recommend a Chard (they had four) and she actually made a suggestion. I was really happy with it and was even more delighted that she pointed out something on the happy hour menu. I really like the atmosphere. I have a thing for balls. I mean red orbs. Only complaint is that the music is normally wayyyyy too loud. The service is always really good, so they balance one another out.Oh...we also tried the Cinnamon tempura ice cream with raspberry drizzle. OH MY FREAKING GOD. It was... absolutely orgasmic! YUM!Now if they could only fix the parking issue...10:30pm on a Saturday night. My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first). Place is hopping. We take a seat at the sushi bar.The Waitress:  "Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?"Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, "yes."Waitress:  "Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too."Me: What the fuck, bitch. "Uh, ok"Dear Ra Waitress,I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employees, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed. It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine. I was hardly the last customer in there. There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me. If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food? Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot. I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined. Thanks for that.   Sincerely,MorganSo I've been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. That's it, Ra - you've lost another customer.

I feel like I'm swimming upstream here. If you have a big appetite and your sushi bill is normally around a bill for one person, I'd suggest checking this place out. Yeah it's in a strip mall and the fish isn't what you'd expect at Nobu but the sushi is great quality for all you can eat. Plus you can order 1/2 rolls and they have around 30 to choose from. All the Nigiri, yes there's a limit on ama ebi and uni but how the frick do you expect a place to stay in business and make a living, give me a frickin break, these reviewers are out of their gawdamm mind. You can also eat as many fresh oysters as you like, that's a deal in itself. My friend and I ordered the sashimi/tempura meal and it was served with 2 shrimp tempura, 2 eggplant, 1 sweet potato, 1 broccoli, and 1 onion. 8 pieces of sashimi, a cut california roll, miso soup, rice and salad for $13.50. What a deal. My other 2 friends had the all you can eat and they loved it. $80 for 4 including all the free ice tea refills. Definitely a deal in my book. Yes I'm a fan. 4 well deserved stars.BEFORE: Surprisingly I rated this place a 4! Before I get on about the food and service, I'd like to say that I have been a customer for years! It started off as one of my favorite sushi joints in town until I noticed the customer service was not on the level as I remembered it to be.  The food was also not that great either, where they piled on rice and cream cheese into each roll! So, if I was a yelper back then, I would have given this place a solid 2!AFTER a year or so, I decided to go back to see if there had been any change.  When I walked in, I noticed the place had been painted, and was definitely much better looking than I can remember.  I did AYCE, and as much as I love sushi, I don't know how  to use chopsticks (Yes, sad story. haha). So, I always ask for a fork =). The server came running back with my fork like he was some sort of knight-in-shining-armor, which is a good sign for me, because everyone usually forgets my darn fork =(.So the food came, and I noticed a definite change, it has become even better than I can remember! The service was also wonderful. The servers were much more observant of their customer's needs, and they were just adorable! *NOTE: Another thing I remember is that they have a Ladie's Night Special on Wednesdays, where AYCE dinner is the lunch price! Take advantage ladies! And another good thing is they are open late! I think til 3am? (I'll have to update the times and specials as soon as I go back)

Restaurant name  Monti's La Casa Vieja
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
First of all, I worked at Monti's twelve years ago. I have seen what goes on behind closed doors and I will come here every chance I get.Michael Monti took over La Casa Vieja from his father, who won it in a poker game as legend has it. Not only is the building historic for being the first estate in Hayden's Ferry (as Tempe was called way back when), not only is it the birthplace of the late Senator Carl Hayden (who was born in the dining room off to the left when you first walk in ... before it was a restaurant, silly), there is much history in the restaurant itself. I attended a book talk & signing at Monti's by the architect that designed the famous upside-down pyramid that is Tempe City Hall. In attendance were a number of former Tempe mayors and architects of Mill Avenue (before it was overrun by chains). These were the OGs of Tempe; they had a lot of stories about old city politics, backroom deals, and midnight hour resolutions. Those backroom deals were in the backrooms of Monti's.When you first walk into the lobby, you'll be greeted by a cadre of hosts. Monti's has a seating capacity in excess of 1,000 people, so it takes a lot of people to keep things running. You need a host to show you around or you will get lost.The lobby has a few walls of photographs with Monti's history, including one of the infamous Senator McCarthy. When he was finally disgraced, he went to "recuperate" in the dry desert air of Arizona (today's version is "spend more time with the family"). Could Monti's have been McCarthy's refuge? Nobody seems to know ... or care, but the photo is there, anyway.I should probably tell you a little about the food. The steaks are excellent. This is not quite Ruth's Chris Steak house, but for the relatively low price, it's pretty damn close! If they err, they err on the side of overcooking your steak, so keep that in mind.The baked potatoes are awesome, crisped on the bottoms. Sometimes they're a little charred instead of crisped, but always good.The Roman Bread is addictive, especially if you dip it in the house-made ranch dressing. They make their own ranch and Roquefort dressings from scratch. Take advantage!I like the sirloin burger. It's better than just a hamburger.It drives the bartenders nuts if you order a bunch of Monti's Coffees after dinner because they're tedious to make, but oh-so worth it. Just tip them well. (Galliano drizzed in the glass, frosted with sugar, flashed until it caramelizes, with Grand Marnier, brandy, coffee, whipped cream, and more Galliano ... I think.)If it's not too busy, see if anyone can give you a little history of the place and maybe a tour. It's huge, with rooms everywhere ... you'll hardly believe it.One star for being the last local business in Mill AveOne star for being family ownedOne star for good foodOne star for an eclectic atmosphereI was pleased with Monti's. I'm not much for steak or Tempe but I was pleasantly surprised. The hostess who sat us could use a lesson in patience, however. We had just sat down in the room to the right of the entrance after being told our wait would be five to ten minutes (it was 8:15  and our reservations were for 8:30). Almost one minute later the hostess was calling our name once, twice, three times before the other hostess told her to check the other room. Our service was a bit slow, I saw a number of other tables around us served their salads and starters much before we received ours. The wait staff seems to be primarily college students.When my salad did arrive it was decent but the roquefort dressing was very good. The men in my party both had steak which they both enjoyed greatly. Both ordered medium rare and the steaks were cooked perfectly and very tender. I had the chicken marsala with a side of spaghetti. The spaghetti sauce wasn't anything like Mama's but it wasn't terrible, either. I found a sage leaf in my sauce which I didn't mind but wasn't sure if it was left as decoration or forgotten in the sauce. The marsala was good.I would say I was most pleased with our bottle of wine, a Rosenblum Zinfandel, and the creme brulee dessert. I may go back to try the shrimp cocktail appetizer and possibly a steak.The old house is a fitting name for this joint. A old house that has not seen a pest exterminator in years, an old house that still serves food from the yester years.. I've been here on many occasions and the food is always  fair to poor, the filet mignon is either a joke or from some other animal I have never heard of. The salads wilted, the croutons stale, the bread stale, even the smell in this place is stale. I hesitated before writing this review but 4 out of 5 visits were awful. I really (yes really) did see a roach on my last and final visit. The service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty. Go somewhere else for a steak, it's worth the extra few bucks.I've driven past this place many times, and I always thought it kind of felt out of place on Mill.  I'd heard mixed reviews, and obviously it isn't super popular here on yelp.  But when I saw the Living Social deal (two drinks, any appetizer and any two entrees) it was time to try them out.  Upon arrival, got a nice quick tour of the building, with a little history of the oldest building in Tempe by the host who sat us, thought that was a nice touch.We were there a little early, so we successfully brought down the demographic as most of the patrons were quite older.  Granted, it was game night @ ASU so I'm sure that had something to do with it.  Started with a couple of drinks and the blackened prime rib appetizer which was tasty - even though I prefer my prime rib medium... the creamy horseradish sauce was bomb.For entrees, we got the seabass and porterhouse, as they were the most expensive items available.  And as it turns out, they were both spectacular.  Perfectly cooked, amazing presentation and excellent service throughout.  The sides were mashed potatoes and chipotle mac & cheese, both really tasty.  The GM stopped by a couple times to check on us, and was quite cordial. All in all, it was a really nice meal, and much better than expected.  I had enough left of the porterhouse to make a perfect steak and eggs Sunday breakfast, so that's always a nice bonus.  As far as steakhouses in the area, this place is 2nd only to Durant's in my book - which says a lot.Do you want some sad news? No one does.But, You have to hear it anyway. Monti's is closing down. Not just for a little remodel ,but for ever and ever!It is really a sad day today. We went to Monti's tonight to try to get one last experience here. But, there are no walk ins at all. It is strictly reservations. We tried to get reservations last week, they were full up until the closing date. Which will be Nov. 17 2014I really loved this place. But, it is all gone now. It was the oldest Business in the Valley,at least in Tempe. Thank you to the Monti Family for all your great years of great food. Boun Sierra

I'm a little bit country. I'm a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak General Store is all country baby. 100% U.S. grade countrilicous! Well, ok, it's in North Scottsdale so it's got a pretty yuppified clientele. Part gas station, convienence store, cafe and post office....this is the cutest place ever. Was kinda my morning hang when I lived at DCRanch. Cup o joe, and the #1 Breakfast with 1 pancake, 2 eggs and bacon. I'm tellin' ya...it's good. Hard to screw up bacon and eggs so I'll rave about my pcake...a bit crispy around the edges and full of buttermilk flavor. Syrup is heated just right and comes in a squeeze bottle the waitress pulls out of her apron pocket. Is that a squeeze bottle of syrup in your apron or are you just happy to see me? Coffee is sturdy and aromatic...like my lesbian cousin Rita. I haven't eaten off the lunch menu...to me it's all about breakfast. My friends have ordered and enjoyed canteloupe with cottage cheese and some kind of omelette which escapes me now, cuz, frankly, I'm not a big fan of the omelette. Childhood trauma and I can't go into it now. The funniest thing about this place are the copper pots and other bric a brac hanging from the rafters that are all for sale. Some of the pots are like $100! OMG....They also have a gas pump that's like $5,000...I guess that's where North Scottsdale meets the country general store. So hitch up the wagon and skeedaddle on up to the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Tell 'em Thomas sent yaFor some reason, this general store makes me feel like I'm about to go on a fun road trip, so it's a perfect place to visit if I want to pretend like I'm going on a trip. I think I feel this way because the general store reminds me of spots we would visit on California road trips during my childhood. This is a gas station, gift shop, post office and delicious diner all in one! It's absolutely worth visiting and seeing for yourself. The general store is filled with knick knacks that include new items and antique items. I'm pretty sure everything in the store is for sale, even the fixtures on the walls! The post office is fast and efficient and a perfect one stop shop. The element that stands out the most is the restaurant. The moment you walk in, a scent of syrup welcomes you and begs you to sit down and enjoy some pancake goodness. You can choose between sitting on the pretty patio or the funky inside diner. It was pretty crowded when we stopped by so we sat inside. I really like this diner because they offer meals which include a pancake, eggs and bacon/sausage or a waffle, eggs and bacon/sausage etc. So, if you are craving some breakfast bread to go with your eggs, you have the option to enjoy both! The food was above diner quality and hearty. It's a perfect place to have a casual yet fun breakfast on a weekend. The patio is also dog-friendly so bring Fido along!

I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:-it's cheap-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)-there is plenty to choose from on the menu-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!

The whole reason I moved to Phoenix was for a job.  Yes, I got a job here in Phoenix and moved here just for that.  California was showing no signs of ever opening up the job market soon so I did what I had to do.  So far, I'm really liking it and finding some cool new places to go and great places to eat.  MacAya's is one of those discoveries.  After spending two weeks with a group of people in a training class, some of us decided to go out and celebrate with lunch on Good Friday, which was a half day for us.  The company was great and I found the place very easily so that was a plus too.  I thought the open patio was awesome and I can see this place hoppin on a Friday or Saturday night.  Even at lunch they had $2 beers!  The service was a little slow, the chips and salsa were ok, and my enchiladas were pretty good, not great, but good.  Honestly, I think it's the atmosphere that got me though.  They had this big outdoor bar and lots of space on the patio, lots of tables and chairs.  I loved the outdoor waterfall too.  So in my opinion, the food is a 2 and I'm giving it another start for the atmosphere.  If you don't expect much when you go, you'll be fine  :)A-OK In my book. Some friends invited us out for Mexican food in Tempe and this is the place they picked. Not crazy busy on a Saturday night at all, which was nice not having to wait. Our food was good, came out in a reasonable time, service was good.... everything was just good. Nothing bad nothing amazing. If you are in the area and in the mood for some Mexican food, give them a try!

Review Text :
It was grand opening night. The space is lovely and filled with great art every where you look. Razz and his wife were excellent hosts as if you were coming in to their home making sure everyone was having a good time. The service was impeccable. I guess this place is closed during summer months I had no idea this was even here I had no idea what to expect. The only complaint I have is there wasnt enough non meat options but I bet on a regular day the regular menu would have more to chose from.The Sepetember Wine Dinner as followsOxtail Hash with Truffle GlazeBaby mixed green bundle, toasted Macadamia nut vinaigrettePaired with Pouilly Fusse 04The presentation was so neat pics coming soon. I could not get enough of the greens and dressing.Scallop en Croute (The hugest scallop I have ever seen EVER) Seared with Fois Gras duxelle in pastry, roasted strawberry & rhubarb compote with a Mersault '04. This was so frikn good HELLO YUMGASM!!I didnt have the rest of the pairing but they seemed to go over pretty well. There was Veal Loin en Papillote steamed in a parchment bag with wild mushrooms, asparagus & morbier cheese and the main course was a Peppered Beef Tenderloin w french green beans & almonds, spinach pancake, roasted potatoes with garlic.. I didnt care for the pancake and I hate pepper and beef lol but the green beans were spectacular seriously the best I have ever had, I dont usually like garlicy things and the potato was awesome I didnt waste any. Pecan Sponge Pie with a bunch of different berries was totally heavenly. All in all I really cant wait to go back when I can pick what to try!! If you have the money to splurge you need to try this place fa sho!!we sat at the chefs table and i love the eye contact Razz makes. some people never look you in the eye and thats a huge pet peeve of mine. but razz locks eyes and i love it. i guess you could call me an eye-locking whore.Be sure to only eat at the chefs table and just let Razz decide what you're going to eat and drink.  the first course was like a crab cake w a curry sauce and carmelized ginger. on top of bitter greens. i can't even explain it other than it was like little angels dancing in my mouth. the 2nd course made me decide that if Razz cooks me seafood I will LOVE it. it was like red snapper with a sauce that i'm just going to call butter bc it was so good and light. and then the snapper was on top of a bed of beans that were to die for. i'm sure there was a great explanation but i couldn't hear Razz over my thoughts. the "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMs" and the "OHHHHHHHHs" going on in my head were very loud. I'm sure my eyes looked like they were going to pop out of my head.this is where things start to get blurry but i'm pretty sure our 3rd course was lobster, crab and some other shell fish in filo dough on top of a tomato, basil and garlic puree. it was soooo super tasty.next was my 2nd favorite course- it was oxtail on top of a queso crisp with an avocado relish. YUM! YUMMY YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!! 5th course- my least favorite- i learned that Razz can make me like seafood but he can't make me like duck. I was super adventurous and figured i'd probably like it but oh my gosh, sooooo not for me. 6th course- delicious rice mixed in with oysters...or was it clams? or muscles? you get the idea, right? whatever it was, i did not find a pearl in the middle.  it had a spanish flare. it was very good. i was pretty overwhlemed and stuffed beyond measure by this point so i can't remember. and i had a glass of wine and i'm a weak drinker so for me that means borderline drunk. last was dessert- it came with a slice of passionfruit cake (not my thing), a slice of a coconut type cake (super good) and a wedge of this very intense piece of chocolate (that was totally my thing). we were so super full we had to box it but it was tasty.I could be mixing everything up and saying it wrong but the important thing to know is that "anything made in this building is the best and everyone will like"- Razzon that note, i can't wait to go back!!!!! he was sooo fun to sit and eat with, definitely be sure to eat the chefs table. BTW- restaurants.com has a $100 gift card when you spend $200- which is SOOOO doable. we had 6 courses, plus dessert and 3 glasses of wine and our bill came out to $196.196-100  coupon____96  / 2 diners= about $50 per person plus tip.Thank you Razz and staff for a delightful meal tonight!  I've driven by Razz's Restaurant countless times over the years, and in addition to the glowing reviews on Yelp, my friend and former boss, Linda L, raves and raves about how Razz's is her favorite restaurant in the Valley.  So, after all of this time, I finally made it in - partially because of the convenient location, but mostly because I wanted to try something new.We had a group of six, and we were celebrating my mom's birthday.  I made an 8pm reservation and we waited just a couple of minutes when we arrived before we were seated at our table.  PJ was our waiter and took fabulous care of us.  Fresh bread and water were served promptly, and Jared chose a bottle of Argentenian Cabernet-Syrah blend  for the table...We shared the Baked Cheese in Phyllo, Crispy Calamari, and Bah Mie Goreng as appetizers... all were delicious.  The calamari had a unique creamy preparation and a major kick to it.  For entrees, three of us (including me) had the Arroz con Mariscos (Razz doesn't skimp on the seafood - this dish was huge and flavorful; kind of like a combination between paella and risotto).  My mom went with the shortribs (which I tried and fell in love with instantly), mom-in-law had a macadamia encrusted grouper special which was supposedly incredible as well, and Jared had the Chicken Scaloppini which he said was "off the charts!"Mom was given a complimentary birthday dessert which we all shared, and was the perfect sweet ending to our meal.  I didn't get a chance to chat with Razz but I will have to return and sit at the Chef's Table next time for sure.  And I can guarantee that "next time" will be sooner rather than later!I have to hand it to my husband.  I'm the Yelper, yet he managed to find a place for my birthday that I did not even have bookmarked.  As we pull into the strip mall, I'm thinking "Oregano's? Really?"  But it was Razz's!  And the Chef's Table (more like a counter) to boot!  Be prepared to get to know those next to you as seating is very tight though.  As many small plates you can handle (I handled 7, thank you) for $10 a pop.  One of my favorites was the seafood beggar's purse with a red chili sauce, but truthfully, I loved all but the last (I really never know when to quit).  Several of the dishes incorporated southwest flavors which is a huge plus for me, too.  And Razz was a delightful host assisting us with wine selections to complement the varied menu.Would definitely do this again, but maybe with fewer courses.  By the time 7 rolled around, I was rolling around.11/30/12I've wanted to visit Razz's Restaurant for YEARS, but could never get the timing right.  I met the owner/chef years ago and would occasionally see him where I work, so I kept telling myself to go have dinner at Razz' soon.  It's part his fault, really, since he keeps changing his business hours throughout the year. Nowadays, his resto is open for dinner on Tuesdays through Saturdays and closed on Sundays and Mondays.  For two or three months in the summer, he closes shop and visits Europe, and then comes back and opens on Fridays and Saturdays for a couple of months before operating full-on for five days starting around October, but don't quote me on this, as I'm a bit hazy on the details.What I am not hazy on, though, is that the food I had here rocked!  While on break at work, I decided that tonight would be the night to try Razz'.  I called up around 630p to make reservation plans for 830p, but said that I most likely will show up earlier.  "Would that be a problem?," I asked, and he said no.  He asked if I would like to sit at the bar/counter, and I asked if I could just be seated somewhere quiet, since I work in a very noisy environment all day, so he said he'd seat me at a booth...Wasn't too hard to find parking, and I finally found out why the place looks deserted from the outside--the "front" really isn't a front, but just a blacked-out window, and the entrance is in the back.  The restaurant is larger than I expected it to be, and I found the interior to be very inviting and, dare I say, almost seductive?  I liked some of the paintings that graced the walls, and some just didn't fit in with the rest.  I'd have to say that these "off" paintings must've been the ones for sale.  (I read on Razz' website that local artists' have works on display.)One of the two hiccups during tonight's service was my first serving of bread, which arrived slightly cold and not as fresh as I would've liked.  No matter, as I ate the crispiest of the crusts, and left the rest in the basket and asked for a second batch http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=wMHMwYLfMh1v9Ens1XxE-Q#wMHMwYLfMh1v9Ens1XxE-Q, explaining my fetish of eating just the warm/hot crusts to my server, who willingly obliged- I love that!  I also asked if I could sample a couple of reds before settling on a glass of wine.  The answer again was "yes, of course."  I felt like dancing, because I felt like I was getting great service!  A man arrived shortly to assist me in finding the right red, so I asked him if he was a sommelier.  He said no, but that he will try to answer any questions I might have.  After a few questions I had on the cabs and a blend (nothing too dry, please!), he suggested I try a sample of the Barra Mendocino pinot noir '09 ($15/glass), and I loved it, and so I ordered a glass to go with one of the four dinner specials that night, the Peppered NY strip with mashed potatoes, a sub of sauteed greens, and fried onion strings on top, $30.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=Oped4Oy1UNJbQQMdKubWoA#Oped4Oy1UNJbQQMdKubWoA  I asked for it to be cooked medium (pink throughout), but it was a bit on the rare side... I still enjoyed it very much, though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=D8vynNUfwYSNgupa4nLvvQ#D8vynNUfwYSNgupa4nLvvQ  I must warn you that this was indeed pepper-encrusted, so if pepper isn't your thing, you might want to opt for something else.  The second hiccup of the night was that, while I mentioned an allergy to mushrooms, I thought I detected something that looked like mushrooms on top of the steak, but these pieces didn't have the feel of 'shrooms.  I'd say they reminded me of water chestnuts, but a server confirmed that they were truffles, which also made me a bit wary, since truffles are similar to 'shrooms... I decided I'd avoid any more bites of these for the time being.  The mashed potatoes were buttery-smooth and chunky at the same time- I always try to control myself when it comes to white potatoes, but these were hard to stay away from, and the greens had a lovely dark-green color to them, were melt-in-your-mouth, but had a nice crisp at first bite, and they tasted tantalizingly of roasted peanuts, even though I was told that Razz' does not use any peanuts in any of the dishes here.  The fried onion strings just added even more fun to this dish (the more textures, the better, I say), and I was loving every bite!For dessert, I settled on the Triple chocolate torte http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=yykeweLCsZcFrDdmivd8gw#yykeweLCsZcFrDdmivd8gw and a cup of brewed coffee.  Again, this course was exquisite!  It packed quite a punch of cacao, yet wasn't too rich- together with the coffee, I almost ate the entire slice!I shall return soon, and next time, I'm sitting at the counter!For my 1700th review, I'm writing about Razz's.  Thanks to Groupon, we've been able to enjoy Razz's Restaurant twice.  Located in an older shopping center on Shea & Scottsdale Rd, I recommend that you make advanced reservations and that you request a table away from the windows if it's during the hot months.  The reason is because the tables near the windows are very hot and the AC here is inadequate because it's an older building with inefficient insulation.Now, on to the food and drink....during our 2 visits, we ordered:Parmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin, $25.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVA#_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVAPeppered New York Strip, $32.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1A#oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1AMixed Greens Salad, $10.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLg#dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLig#rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLigPietra Santa Merlot, $48http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQA#hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQAHahn Meritage, $60Crespelles, $14.95Grilled Rack of Lamb Chops, $38.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9Pw#W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9PwPan Roasted Duck Breast, $26.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3A#1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3APraline Hazelnut Torte, $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQ#6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQTriple Chocolate Torte. $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlA#72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlAWhere do I begin?  Hmmm...well, the Mixed Green Salad is awesome. They have a house dressing that's to die for and goes well with the fresh vegetables.  A perfect way to start a meal.  I ordered on both visits, it's that good.The Peppered NY Strip Steak was nothing to write home about....very average.  However, the Parmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  It has a perfect combination of sweet and meaty flavor to it....well done Razz, well done!  The Pan Roasted Duck Breast and Grilled Rack of Lamb Chops are also fantastic!  We enjoyed 3 out of the 4 entrees we had over the 2 dinners....great job team Razz!For Dessert we had the Praline Hazelnut Torte and the Triple Chocolate Torte.  Both were very good.The Wine we had on both nights was spectacular and went well with our dinner.  They offer a decent selection of Wine.The restaurant also doubles as an art gallery, so you can find paintings on the walls for sale....if that's your gig.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2g#WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2gWe didn't realize that the kitchen was actually right in front of the bar seats, so the bar seats are premium seats because you can watch Razz and the team cook...Razz will also come up and greet you if you're sitting at the bar.  However, since we didn't book reservations in advance, those seats were taken on both nights we visited.  If we come back, we'll try to book a couple of seats at the bar.Return Factor - 90%I've wanted to take Mom here, and she finally relented after all these years of saying no.  Could she have missed me after being away for eleven days? She ordered the Peppered blue cheese NY strip, and I the Pork Schnitzel.  (Darn! I wanted steak!)  I would've enjoyed a glass of red, but she isn't a fan of wine, and I was tired from running around all day AND I also just came from massage session, AND I was driving us home after.  Mom really enjoyed the steak, cooked medium, with two sides- mashed potatoes and a vegetable bundle, while I found the candied purple cabbage that garnished the pork schnitzel, to be too sweet.  The entree also included mashed potatoes and a veggie bundle, but mine was missing!  I'd requested that carrots be omitted from the bundle, and when I'd asked about the missing bundle, our server said that the carrots could not be omitted, so I said I'd take a bundle, anyway.  More veggies for Mom to enjoy leftovers with!  Note to self: Next time, go for the steak!  The table bread and butter were d'lish!Service was sweet and friendly- thanks, Candace!I don't think Mom will be so quick to say NO the next time I offer to take her here!

"I read the news today...Oh boy!"http://tinyurl.com/ylpza9aGlenn Bell Jr. died this past weekend at the tender age of 86...a long life of slingin' taco's to be sure:)I hadn't been to Taco Bell in almost 4 years, until today...I was moved to drop by Taco Bell in a sort of tribute to Glenn...one of the more prominent "voices" during my formative years:)This Taco Bell in particular...store # 22354 is one of the more important spiritual touch points for paying tribute to Glenn...Scottsdale was the home of the first Taco Bell franchise (and the fact that Westaco, Inc's. HQ is in the same lot with this store makes them the defacto, if not actual, heir to the legacy of Glenn Bell:)I had my first Taco Bell taco in Corvallis, Oregon in 1970 when I hit college with a mighty crash:)It was the second time I had ever had "Mexican" food..the first time was a week prior at a place called Taco Time in Eugene, Oregon.I was thrilled to find out about pizza, Italian food, pizza, Mexican, pizza, chinese take out, pizza...you get the drift...I was a country boy in the (for me) big city and I was going to find out all about life's pleasures...starting with taco's:)I was hooked on Taco Bell for a long time (a time that, coincidentally, was the time when I had very little money yet still needed to eat occasionally:)Taco Bell and the others filled the role of reasonably tasty maintenance eating for a long, long time...it was a truism in 1975 that no one...no one... could eat $5.00 worth of Taco Bell at a sitting, all by themselves:)Could.Not.Be. Done!It may still be "truish" with the "cheapo" menu:)But it has never really been very good:(That was something I actually didn't discover until a trip to LA with a girlfriend (the same trip that I discovered In-n-Out:)...real Mexican food is very different than the goop that Glenn had sold me over the years...and very much better:)But that didn't stop me from eating at Taco Bell...beggars can't be chooser's...and I was a beggar for a few years.Today was a nostalgia stop for me (as was my last visit to a Taco Bell a few years ago), as well as a tribute to Glenn:)I was more interested in watching my "beefy burrito" being made this time...the ladies in the kitchen pulled various levers in response to the computerized instructions for my order on the monitors overhead...the different shades of unidentifiable goop that cascaded onto the flour tortillas...the quick hand movements of their ritual wrapping of the burrito (I once dated a girl that worked at Taco Bell...she knew how to wrap a burrito...but that's another story:)It still isn't very good food...but everyone at this location is sweet and pleasant, my order was correct, I was in severe need of a retox after a 6 miler this morning and I did manage to eat about 2/3 of the burrito...even with mulitple "bags" of hot sauce it was not very good:(But that's not the fault of the sweet ladies behind the counter, nor of Westaco, nor of Glenn Bell...I think when Pepsi or YUM or whoever got their hands on Taco Bell...well...I'm not writing this to get on a rant about corporate agendas vs. quality:)I wanted to give them an extra star...just for being who they are and where they are, but I hear the spirit of Glenn Bell telling me "don't do it, Donald...make them earn it" :-)That's all I need, another voice in my head...Thanks Glenn:)Taco Bell aka "Taco Hell" brings back amazing memories from my high school days.  There was a Taco Bell located right across the street from BHS (my high school), and if memory serves, the drive-thru was open pretty damn late; maybe even 24 hours?!  At the time, my friends and I made many a "run for the border," and I remember the food being great!Either I was really drunk back then or Taco Bell has gone down hill or my taste buds have matured quite a bit since then, because after eating Taco Bell for dinner last night, I no longer "quiero Taco Bell."  Or maybe I ordered wrong?I'm quite nauseous thinking about what I ordered (and ate) last night:-1 Mexican Pizza (540 calories / 30 grams of fat)-1 Chicken Soft Taco (180 calories / 6 grams of fat)-1 Pintos and Cheese (170 calories / 6 grams of fat)I didn't know there was a "Drive-Thru Diet® Menu" until looking at their website just now either... oh well, I'm eating for two right now!I also didn't realize the slogan changed to "think outside the bun" until actually listening to the radio commercials as I drove home with my food in my lap last night.    I will say that the drive-thru was super quick and my order was right and all for under $6.  What a bargain!I'm sure Taco Bell is still a great option when you're out late, have had a few too many, and/or are eating on a budget.  But I don't recommend it when you're completely sober and it's a normal hour.  Probably not the healthiest option for the baby in my belly either... Bottom line: I don't plan on returning for many years to come, although I do have a pretty big high school reunion coming up next year, so I may just have to give it one more shot!

This is a local cafe and is pretty crowded on the weekend for breakfast.  It's what you want to look for when you're not from the area and want to have a good, authentic local dining experience.  The breakfast is relatively basic and the food pretty good.  The portions are quite large, perhaps to compensate for the quality and taste but overall it's a good value.

Saturday night, no reservation, my choice was to wait 45 minutes for a table or take a table in the bar.  I opted for the bar.  I should have waited or went somewhere else.I had eaten at Roy's in Philadelphia, which was an awesome experience.  I expected that same in Scottsdale.  Didn't happen.I started out with my favorite drink, an Original Hawaiian Martini.  They are not cheap with the alcohol in the drink, it's very potent.  For dinner, I opted for choices on the Prix Fix menu.  My starter was a Hawaiian Crunch Winter roll.  It was great, made with shrimp tempura and avocado.  For my entree, I selected the Panang-style tiger shrimp with vegetable coconut curry and jasmine rice.  Very good combination of flavors, but could have been served a little warmer.  Dessert was the always awesome "Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle".  This dessert is always to die for.  It's the best  dessert I have ever had anywhere!!Other than the slightly cold entree, the thing that amazed me about this restaurant was the fact that the staff didn't intercede when a nearby customer managed to annoy me all evening long.  This guy was in the restaurant bar, supposedly waiting for his brother.  Well, I was there for over an hour and the brother never showed up.  Go figure.  But, in the meantime, this guy managed to annoy me, tell me strange stories, sit at my table (until I asked him to leave), go back to this table, remove papers from his bag, bring them back to my table and spread them out, (until I asked him to leave again), used my cell phone to call his brother, mother, sister, god knows who else.  But at least while he was on my cell phone, he wasn't bothering me.  He even begged me for a ride and helped himself to some of my food.  You get the picture.  I can not believe that the staff allowed this to happen.  It's outrageous.  Other customers noticed, I guess I should have demanded to speak to a manager to have situation resolved, but I didn't want to make a scene.  I couldn't believe it was happening or that is was allowed to happen!!!  I even had to sneak out a side door when this nut wasn't looking, so he wouldn't follow me.  Completely nuts.  I think a restaurant of this caliber has an obligation to protect it's customers.

After treating Mom and myself to both a relaxing and totally rejuvenating 90-minute massage sessions at SWIHA, we headed to Sushi 101 (my second visit, her first!) for happy hour.  We arrived at around 5:30p and sat ourselves at the sushi counter, said hello to Tots, who smiled and greeted us warmly.  As I've said before, don't let his young looks fool you- he's competent, he's quick, and he even has a great memory!  All it took was for me to say "No *..." and he completed my sentence by recalling all the food allergies I have to worry about when dining at a sushi establishment!  Kudos to Tots, and to Sushi 101 for employing employees like him!Since I was dining again with Mom, I forgot to take photos, but I assure you, we thoroughly enjoyed EACH and EVERY dish we tried (well, all but one*, that is)...Two bowls of miso soup- Complimentary, if sitting at the sushi counter.  Was surprised to find out that their miso base did not contain *!  I've had to avoid miso for so long now, that it was such a treat to enjoy again.  Lovely, rich flavor, with scallions and tofu, but a little bit on the salty side.  I'll be sure to have some everytime I visit!  Vegetable tempura; $3/2 pcs. sweet potato, 2 pcs. zucchini, 1 pc. onion ring, 1 pc. broccoli- We ended up ordering another serving, for a total of two dishes, $6*Gyoza, $3/5 pcs.- Couldn't try these myself as they contained mushrooms.  Mom decided she won't order these pork-filled dumplings again, saying they weren't very good.  I noticed she ate all but one ;)Spider roll, $6.95/5 pcs.- Pure joy!Rainbow roll, $8.95/8 pcs.- Sublime!Volcano roll, $9.50/8 pcs.- Scallops, crab, asparagus, yamogobo, and smelt roe!  Served warm, and will definitely be a "repeat guest performer" at many happy hour meals to come. Total bill $45.00, including 20% tip, for two people.  Bill is for food only, as we didn't order any beverages save iced water.  Offered to split a bottle of Tsingtao with her ($2 or $2.50), but she turned it down.  No biggie.  I'm all about eating my calories anyway :D Again, if my descriptions of the rolls sound like they're lacking in traditional ingredients, you're not mistaken.  I've had to ask for substitutions as I'm allergic to many sushi ingredients.  Another reason why I love patronizing Tots and Sushi 101- they're so accommodating!!Usually sushi restaurants, that know they have bellow average nigiri, make up for it by having unique and tasty rolls. This place fails on both counts....Nigiri: Fish was stale. Almost like it was frozen just a few minutes ago, so there was almost no taste. The rice was disgusting.Rolls: We didn't finish most of the rolls. Not because there was too much food, but because it was hard keeping it down.Why two stars? Well the service was great, as were their miso soup and green tea. So if you want some tasty miso with tea.... this is your place.My friend from Arizona begged me not to give them a bad review, because he comes here a lot. This is the best I can do.... I was seriously going to write something a lot worse.Read this carefully:They have a POLICY to STEAL your MONEY.Mangers are telling waitstaff to "round checks up" - so when you get your bill of $8.65 and give them a $20, you will get back $11 and no change. Sure a disappearing $ .45 doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is when it is your money. Then the waiter tells you that his boss told him, and other waitstaff told him that's "the way it's done." This happened to me not 20 minutes ago.Stealing. Policy. Illegal.(never mind the mediocre food....)Congratulations Sushi 101.  You are my first one star review.  I have high standards for this category and you get to go down in my Yelp history as breaking my 1 star cherry. This is the WORST sushi I have ever had.  I would rather eat the stuff from Kyoto Bowl.  In fact, in comparison Kyoto bowl sounds rather delicious to me at the moment, that is if you didn't turn me off from sushi altogether. Happy hour schmappy hour, I can't believe people pay to eat this crap.  On top of that the service was awful.  I had a beer and finished it not half way into my time there and was never asked if I wanted another. After that I find on my bill they factored gratuity into my tip.  The only time I know this to be a common practice is for groups of 6 or more. There were five of us.  I think they have to build in the tip because they know they are awful and wouldn't make any money otherwise.College kids, I know you don't have much money but trust me, there are plenty of decent or even great sushi places out there that offer amazing HH deals. I cringe to think of how many kids will have their first sushi experience here and will never know how truly delicious and amazing sushi actually is.I've driven by Sushi 101 many of times and never really had that urge to try it. My son and wife always has Japanese urges and we were in Tempe so what the heck. I walked in and the place isn't too big or small. Nothing really stood out to me. The waitress was very good in greeting us and getting our drinks. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Yaki Soba with skinny noodles. It had cabbage, carrots, chicken, and green onions. Not bad. It had a nice kick to it. Not overly spicy but probably just right. My daughter had the Chicken Yaki Soba and it was exactly like mine but without the spice. She really did like her dish and gobbled it up. As for my son and wife, they got the Raman noodle soup. It had everything in it. Cabbage, carrots, fish cake, chicken. They both thought that it was way too salty. So they didn't like it at all. This is why I was struggling on rating this place. It's really a 3 1/2 star. We got all of our food before our sushi. We got the Rainbow and Dragon rolls. I thought they were sort of small but were very good. Enjoyed them. Liked the idea of presenting the rolls on tea leaves. Nice. Overall the service was good. She kept our water glasses filled and kept on checking on us. Food was good and so so (little to salty for our liking). So since my wife and son are the Japanese food lovers, not sure if we will be back again. We'll see. Again 3 1/2 stars.

The Kind of Place You Want To Bring A Book or Newspaper to and Just Eat and RelaxThe valley is filled with places to pick up breakfast. There are the typical doughnut and bagel shops to the sit-down chain restaurants. However, once in a while, if your lucky, you come across that one neighborhood place that turns out to be a "stand-out spot".  You know what I mean, the place that everyone flocks to.  Well that place happens to be Brothers Family Restaurant!Today was my first visit to Brothers Family Restaurant and all I can say is, it won't be my last. Brothers is clean, the staff is friendly, the service is fast, the food is  very tasty, perfectly made and did I mention great prices.Brothers has one of the best family style menus around, from the countless egg dishes, to the usual breakfasts favorites, like, pancakes, French toast,  biscuits &gravy, omelettes, skillets...you name it, Brothers serves it.  Their  chorizo & green chili omelette with home style potatoes is to die for. Best Breakfast Ever! I would absolutely recommend Brothers Family Restaurant to everyone.

Review Text :
I had never been to the Fiesta except for the movie theater when my family wanted to meet at Fuego. There were five in our party altogether, and each of us ordered something different. I ordered the Prix Fix menu for $28: Caesar salad, top sirloin with a vegetable, and creme brulee. The Caesar salad was somewhat wilted but had a good dressing. The steak was deliciously charred and it came with French beans, where the other menu items did not come with sides and had to be ordered separately. The creme brulee was a very good one, freshly torched and deliciously candied. The rest of the table all ordered steaks as well and added sides. They also ordered bacon-wrapped shrimp that they all enjoyed, but I'm neither a shrimp nor a bacon eater, so I abstained. I snuck a bite of the sweet potato, creamed spinach, and twice-baked potato, and all were delicious. The service was great as well. My one complaint is the place settings and how they seated us...we were in a circular booth with two other tables in the restaurant and we felt pretty awkward sitting at this particular table. The place settings aren't really conducive to balancing cutlery on the on the plates. A strange critique, I know, but my knife kept falling off my plate! This is a nice spot on this side of Henderson, but I don't know if I will be back because there are other places to try in town.My mother-in-law had a dining certificate here so we tried it last night. Fuego's is not what you'd expect walking through the Fiesta. The setting is very nice and laid back. We were seated at a comfy booth. It's nice to enjoy a low key steakhouse once in a while.Service was good and attentive. The bread basket was awesome (Diet? What diet? Lol) Our favorite was the croissant-like muffin that is the best bread I've had in a long time. Light flakey layers that are buttery good. There was also a pretzel bread that was fun to eat.Fuego's being a steakhouse, we ordered our favorite cut...filet mignon. First came the caesar salad which was ok and came on chilled plates but salad was a bit wilted. Our filets were tender but had temperature issues with being a level down from how we ordered it. So my well-done ended up being more of a medium well which was actually not too bad. It was served with some French green beans and our choice of complementary sauce. We tried the peppercorn...pretty good and the bernaise...not that good.Overall, a good value for good sized petite filet and green beans with a Caesar salad...$24. We would come to Fuego's for another meal.

Review Text :
I really enjoyed Sea Saw.  We were lucky b/c we didn't have dinner reservations but we went there early and they had room for us at the bar (which was even better b/c we could watch the chef's in the kitchen).  If you have the time and the money, I'd recommend just going for the Omakase.  We went with a few a la carte dishes.  We started out w/ the Hamachi which was a beautiful slice of hamachi over a piece of grapefruit and avocado.  Tako and Tomato was next and that might have been my favorite.  They grilled the tako, put it over home-made mozzarella on top of a piece of tomato all topped w/ wasabi oil.  It was so flavorful and had a great consistency.   We then tried the Soft Shell Shrimp Fry which was ok but I didn't think that special.  We then moved on to the White Fish Carpaccio which was thinly sliced fish cooked in garlic oil.  This was very good, very unique, and surprisingly not greasy.  This dish was also served w/ some homemade bread to dip in the oil.  I think I could have kept eating everything on the menu but we moved onto dessert which was a great ending.  I tried the tofu chocolate dessert which was very good and very thick.  I was lucky enough to try the banana dessert as well which, even if you don't like banana desserts... you should try because it was that good.  When you go, don't forget to try the mixed drinks... I'd recommend the sparkling sake one.  If you're in the mood for wine though, they have an amazing wine list.Overall, I thought it was a great experience.Nobu's food doesn't challenge you, it thrills you. You already know about the accolades and awards that extend far beyond this valley. So let's get down to the do's and dont's.Do:  - sit at the counter, at least half the time.  - beg for oxtail stew. get on the "oxtail stew call list". if they run out, find and kill an ox. chop off his butt.  - say yes to the little, live, flash-fried river crabs.  - try the omakase menu at least once.  - order a bottle of the Jozen Mizu No Gotoshi sake. it's floral and dry and perfect. (we mow through 2 or 3, but we're drunks)  - order the white fish carpaccio. garlic has waited 1000s of years for this dish to be created.  - be nice to Chantal. she is a cool chick.  - marvel at how skinny Jeff the Chef is.  - work harder to make more money to come back to sea saw.Don't:  - come here for sushi rolls.  - tell your party that it's "right up there with Stingray".  - bring someone who wants sake bombers.  - bring a large group. it's optimized for couples and small groups.  - be allergic to anything, cuz god knows what's in there.  - look at the prices. ever. when the check comes, cover the top with your other hand and just sign. tell chantal to add the tip in.  - be afraid to ask the chefs what they're doing and why. learn.Rarely is innovative food so comforting. We always leave happy and less wealthy. If a place can consistently do that for you and keep you coming back, it's onto something.

What was that freaking smell? Holy crap. Smelled like a dirty diaper wrapped in farts. Permeated the entire restaurant. Sure didn't do much to make the greasy over-priced food any more appetizing, I'll tell you that. Thought maybe it was a one-time thing, but after a quick scan of a couple previous reviews, it seems to be a recurring theme with this place. Yuck.

What happens when a Croatian family, 2 gays and a brood of CenPho peeps head to the westside for a birthday brunch at...*gasp*...a chain restaurant. Well, I'll tell ya what happens. Big Fun. That's what! We had at least 20 people and took over an entire room in back. That was smart of them as we were a "lively" group. Granted it took quite a while to get drinks out to us, but I'm a restaurant person and forgive easier than others. We had strawberry mimosas served with a split of Freixenet. Fantastic! I had the cordon blue crepes with ham, Swiss, onion and eggs topped with Dijon cream sauce...seriously...they were heavenly. I was last to be served so I was nervous my crepes would be petrified. They were piping hot! Also on my plate were fresh grapes. They were chilled & snappy. Kind of like Angelina Joilie's personality. I have to say the place was pretty messy, including the restroom, which oddly smelled like the men's restroom at the Esplanade. I'll remember you Mimi. Next year, when I'm visiting the westside again, I may swing by for those crepes. Oh. One weird thing happened. After a few of us had ordered our third strawberry mimosa, we were told they had no more champagne left. Really? Cuz it feels like you're cutting us off! Whatev! We had consumed plenty but got a chuckle out of being cut off in a room full of coffee swilling seniors!

Review Text :
Hung a Loon is what is should be called! I tried this place when I bought my house I was moving, tired, and hungry an interesting little man came to the door. He was carring with him a menu to the Hing Loon. It had pretty pictures of the fabulous feast that would await. I asked about the food and was assured it was delicious. So I proceeded to call and speak to a woman who did not understand English very well (not uncommon for a mom and pop Chinese joint). After repeating my order several times and feeling confident that she had it down. I sat back and waited for Beef chop suey, Teriyaki chicken, an egg roll and free crab puffs the special on the menu to be delivered. 45 minutes later it arrived and smelled great. I figured since I live 1/2 a mile from this place that 45 minutes could mean they are very busy or just very slow. After tasting the food I believe it was the latter of the two. 1st both dishes were swimming in sauce almost like soup. The chop suey touted brown oyster sauce it was white and it frightened me a little. I took the first bite and could not allow my stomach to be subjected to this kind of crime. I promptly spit it into my napkin. The teriyaki chicken was very fatty and had a funny taste it was rubbery like that of an old bird. Egg roll I think not grease stick! My favorite was crab puffs! You bite in and get a puff of air not the creamy cheese and Crab as intended for a crab puff to be. Don't do it! For the love of god and all that is holy I beg you! Do not punish your taste buds with this garbage served in cute Togo containers!

Review Text :
Seriously...i love spicy food especially thai food but... The break down:FOOD QUALITY:   pretty good 4 out of 5PRICE:  Too expensive for the portions, they even force you to buy bottled water! The bottles are SOO tiny, and can you imagine not having enough water when you eat spicy foods??SERVICE:  OMG...the owner sings on certain nights and makes himself a rockstar?? One of the waitresses were kind of rude to us because one of my friends asked if the portions have changed...lol.  They also try to "up sell" everything on their menu, always coming around to ask us to try this and that....We felt like we were being hustled and all we wanted was to eat dinner...Originally me and the wifey were gonna go to Blueberry Hill since we have never been there. This place just happens to be right next to it. Since my wife loves Thai food and we have never been to Krung Thai, it was a no brainer.Came in on Thursday night at 8:30. They close at 11 so we had plenty of time to order and eat. Was greeted and sat down right away. There were only a couple other tables occupied so im assuming the dinner rush has already come and gone.We order our favorites. Deep Fried Tofu, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Shrimp Pad See Ew. The deep fried tofu was good as expected. Golden and crispy with a side of a sweet n sour type of sauce. The Pineapple Fried Rice was just ok. It didn't have the abundance of pineapple chunks like im used to. You would think that with the name of the dish that pineapple chunks would be all over the place. I think there was only about 6 pieces?As for the Shrimp Pad See Ew. Ironically the ew part of it was real. As I moved the dish closer to my plate I can smell the distinct odor of raw shrimp. Like it wasnt cooked all the way enough. At first I thought I was imagining it but once I started eating it all I could taste was something close to like raw shrimp on the verge of spoiling. My wife had the same reaction. It was at this point that we requested another order of Pad See Ew but with beef instead. I had to get a new plate because the odor was lingering on it. After about 5 minutes we receive our new dish. As soon as I took one bite I can faintly taste the same thing just like the last dish. At this point I was thinking maybe they cooked the food in the same wok with out washing it? Why else would the raw shrimp taste still be there?By this point me and the wifey just ended up finishing the Pineapple Fried Rice and Fried Tofu. We ended up boxing the Pad See Ew. Why I don't know. Maybe we will try it again later to see if it was just us? Umm....nope, still tasted nasty. I know what you guys are thinking. Send it back? Take it off the bill? No, we are not the type of people to keep complaining especially if we gave you a second chance already.This does not take away from the service which was good. Our server was there for refills and redoing our second order, etc.In closing, I don't think we will be coming back here any time soon. Maybe we just caught them on an off night. Hopefully the next visit if there is one, it will be better and I can update this review accordingly.Yelp 2015 review #5 "Lets get Krung? Nope not here!"504 overall

Maybe it's me, but I've had the worst luck with customer service at EVERY KFC I go to.. Hawaii was a joke, but I can't figure out what location it was to write a review! Anyways, this KFC is probably the next worst with customer service. This little brunette woman was the worst! I had to repeat my order like 5 times and I could hear her laughing and talking with another employee through the speaker so she kept having to ask me "what was that?" with a rude attitude. I finally pulled up to the window to place my order face to face. She then went to repeat my order that I just told her, and things were still wrong! Seriously?! At least my finally correct order was edible. 1 star for service and 2 stars for the food.. #blah

Review Text :
Marcus seemed to cover pretty much everything in his review of Elements and their recent transformation...  I'd just like to say "ditto" to everything he said since I was finally blessed with the opportunity to experience a meal at this Valley gem... and in case you were wondering, it was worth the long wait!A few things that Marcus did not mention:- the (complimentary) buddha bread and eggplant dip; a nice little starter to whet our appetites- the side order of shishito peppers that we ordered as a starter - delicious with just the right amount of kick- the pork belly fried rice (I didn't have any but Jared loved it!)- the sautéed mushrooms (why don't my sautéed mushrooms come out this good?)And just to go into a bit more detail: I ordered the Arctic Char entrée and J went with the Duck Breast... both were prepared perfectly.  Elements touts itself as serving "farm-fresh American cuisine with Asian accents, including sustainable seafood and the best local produce."  I love the Asian accents and everything we at was extremely high quality... the attentive service from Mark and staff included.We agreed on one dessert for the table; we told Mark to surprise us between the cracker jack soup and the bamboo torte... and bamboo torte it was.  I floated home after my experience at Elements... fine wine, exquisite food, attentive service, beautiful views, awesome ambiance, and incredible company - what more can you ask for?Was invited to have dinner with some friends.  Located at the Sanctuary Resort, this elegant restaurant provided an awesome dining experience!  The decor is very modern and the service was excellent!  Now, on to the food....I ordered:Local Organic Greens (Chinese Long Beans, Toasted Nori, Soy Sesame Vinaigrette, $10)Pan Roasted Free Range Chicken (Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Chinese Broccoli, Lemongrass Pan Jus, $28)Glass of Orin Swift "Prisoner" Red Blend Zinfandel (Napa, $17)The Organic Greens were very tasty.  The Soy Sesame Vinaigrette was tangy and went very well with the Greens.  The Chicken was amazing, so tasty and juicy!Overall, it was a great night.....good food and good times!Return Factor - 100%It has been a while since we've dined at Elements, so we decided to drop in for dinner last week.  It was 6:30 pm on a Thursday and we were able to get seated immediately with no reservation.

It's not as large of a portion as it sounds, but it can be shared between 2 or 3 people.  I had the Wedge Salad, which was too sweet and "soggy" for my tastes.  As you can see in my photo, the Salad had dressing on the bottom of the Salad and was also topped with Pickled Onion, Tomato, and Avocado....it was missing that "crisp crunch" that I love about Wedges.  I won't order it again.For the main course, TBH had the Foie Gras, which she devoured....she loved it.  I had the Pepper Encrusted Filet which was also awesome and cooked perfectly just a shade above Medium.  The Filet was full of flavor and the portion was just right.  To compliment our entree's we had a bottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, which hit the spot.For dessert, we had the Irish Car Bomb and the S'mores....the Irish Car Bomb was awesome.  The S'mores was good too, but very rich and we couldn't finish it.  They have a nice selection of after dinner drinks, so I had a glass of Ladgate 20 yr Tawny Port to go with dessert.The wait staff is very attentive here and gave us impeccable service throughout dinner.  That's one of the reasons why we love this place.Return Factor - 100%

This is one of the better jack locations I've been to. Sometimes the drive thru can be long but it moves quick. I get coupons in the mail so I use them most of the time and they take them with no problem. One of the best things Jack ever did was invent the munchie meal. It starts after 9 pm and changes but right now it's $6 for a hella-peno burger, 2 tacos and a mix of regular fries as well curly fries. The burger has jalapeños on it but also stuffed jalapeños and taco sauce. Damn it's hella good! Not that I expected much but I wasn't crazy about their mini pancakes. I'll stick to the ultimate sausage sandwich for breakfast instead.

OK... I'm not some elitist snob that only dines out in 5 star establishments and though I do have an educated palate, I'm also a realist when it comes to the type of place where I'm dining. That said... I accept that I'm now going to be known as the "Official Curmudgeon" of yelp... but I can't help but believe in the concept of service and quality in exchange for fair compensation. Unfortunately, it's a totally unknown (or ignored) concept here. Come on! Really? FIVE BUCKS for a Corona?? This is AZ people, not NYC! Combined with the "famous" ribs that seriously would NOT place in my top FIFTY and a sour faced waitress that clearly didn't give a s*#& if we were happy, this has to top our list of dining ripoffs. You could offer me 500 bucks to eat here and I'd pick the cafeteria at my old high school instead! If this place were anywhere but Cave Creek where people obviously have money to piss away, they wouldn't survive. Wish I could rate 0 stars.

Call this pizza for getting yourself the best insult in the city. Order the pizza they will promise delivery in 30 minutes, call to verify your order they will say it takes 1.5 hrs to reach for the delivery, and you would be asked to cancel if you want to know the status. Have respect and eat with some sense in this great city.

Review Text :
Takamatsu is my kind of place.  I've been going here (Also the one in Glendale on Dunlap) for about 8 years, so you know it must be good.  This place is GREAT for groups.  You can grill your own food right at your table, or have one of the staff members do it for you.  With your dish, comes a variety of tiny sides (Im sure there is a Korean name for these.  If someone knows, please... do tell.)  The sides are all vegetables such as spiced potatoes, cabbage, bean curd paste, and kimchee.  I stay away from the Kimchee unless it is the spicy red variety.  To me most kimchee smells like garbage.The sushi is decent but not the best, and they have an assortment of sake for you to try.  Bottom line? If you like Korean Barbeque, I guarantee you'll like it. But, if you don't, don't take my guarantee seriously.**Afterthought**Don't let the "less than good" reviews about their sushi drive you away.  It is decent.  However, if you aren't coming here for the awesome Korean BBQ, go somewhere else.Meh. I was really looking forward to trying out Takamatsu. After all, it is right up the street from our house. Dude and I joined Sarah R. and a large group (15-20, I think, many dropped in and out) here for her Sendoff Dinner.Yes, the quality service tends to decline when larger groups are present. But what we experienced was downright unacceptable.Really rude server. Mumbled and spoke too quietly and we seemed like a giant inconvenience to her. Brought rolls to our table that belonged to no one in our party, and got visibly peeved (eye rolling, dirty looks, etc.) when one of us told her politely it wasn't ours.Good luck getting water or utensils. Dude and I ended up just sharing a glass. Trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare. Another server approached our party and asked Dude and I if some rolls were ours. They need a better way to keep track of tickets. Got to the point we walked up to the cashier, told him what we ordered and paid.Also, another server on Sarah's end of the table got frustrated with a new guest to our party and RIPPED UP his sushi ordering sheet. In front of customers ... And was that really necessary? We probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a Korean BBQ joint. But hey, sounded tasty! Tried the Las Vegas, Tiger, Rainbow and Heart Attack Rolls. Everything tasted the same. Way too much rice, thinly cut fish (to the point it looked like just the skins), and the breading on the Vegas Roll was bready and soggy. Like it had been sitting out a long time. And don't even get me started on the culinary clusterphuk that was that Heart Attack Roll. Come on: Eel sauce + spicy cheese sauce + cream cheese + jalapeno pepper does not equal a palate pleaser.I did; however, get to taste a piece of Sarah's spicy pork dish ... That was excellent!The bright side to this place? We had a wonderful time enjoying the company of our friends, and Takamatsu was OK with me bringing a cake for Sarah.Despite the dismal experience, I wanted to come back and try the Korean BBQ. That is, until Dude got an epic case of food poisoning. Going on day two. And we're talking about a guy that almost never gets sick. Can count on one hand after nearly 9 years together how many times he's been sick.Not worth $8.95/roll; sure as hell wasn't worth an 18% gratuity charge. I'll stick to Shimogamo for delicious sushi that matches the price, and will be on the hunt for another Korean BBQ place. Spare your digestive tract and avoid the sushi. Stick to BBQ if you go.It was in the early 2000's when I had my first taste of Korean barbecue.  It was at the Takamatsu down in Phoenix and I thought it was the greatest thing ever to be able to get Japanese food along with your Korean grilled meats.  Wow!  Since those innocent times, the Phoenix area has grown greatly in the food scene and I have seen the light.I've long ruled out Takamatsu to get my Korean eats but I must admit, it's been a minute since I've had their sushi and on an invite to test out their AYCE sushi tonight, I figured it was worth a try and another visit.  What a mistake.  I wish I can take back my $23.99 and go elsewhere.  The fish isn't fresh, the cuts are uneven, and there's just entirely too much filler rice.  I get that it's AYCE but never have I experienced a place that would justify adding hella rice and barely any goods.  There was also way too much vinegar in the rice and the acidity made my stomach unhappy.  Don't get me started on how oily the Las Vegas roll was.The service was pretty non-existent on top of the sub-par food.  There were at least three servers and only ten tables.  Most people were grilling so it's not like they needed much attention.  We were the only ones doing AYCE and it seemed like the servers were going out of their way to avoid eye contact and collecting our order sheet.  Since we were getting plates upon plates for our orders, we had a small mountain of dishes building which we stacked nicely and no one to collect them.  It's a small thing but I wish they whisked them away.Anywho, never again, Takamatsu.  We had a good run in those good old innocent and naive days but with all the competition out there, y'all just can't keep up.  Peace.

Review Text :
Great little spot in Glendale!If you hadn't noticed, the West side (make that all sides...) is a strip mall wonderland.  When I got to Kiss the Cook, I was pleasantly pleased to see that it was a free standing building (guess I'm easily impressed) with plenty of parking and even a cute patio!The menu was full of typical breakfast favorites including omelets, pancakes, and hearty breakfast indulgences.  5-star service!  Our coffee was never low and our water glasses were always replenished.  The decor inside was similar to my Michigan grandma's basement which made everything seem extremely relaxed.  As other Yelpers noted, the muffin basket is a highlight.  Once you order you are greeted with a little warm basket with several different types of miniature muffins of love.  mmmI love that when you get your bill (cheap too by the way!), you are greeted with a real Hershey's kiss!  These are the touches that are always forgotten with chain restaurantsI know I will return-totally worth a try if you are on this side of townKiss the Cook is stellar in some ways and just misses the mark on others, which in my book rates it a solid four stars. I have been eating here since high-school and find this little family owned restaurant charming.In addition to their regular menu (you can order breakfast or lunch any time), they always have three or four lovely specials. Generally, one is any omnivores dream, one takes fruit to a whole new level, and the other features one of their baked products done up to the nines.My personal favorite is the "build your own" omelet. The ingredients are all super fresh, the omelet is always stuffed, and the house potatoes that are served on the side are very yummy (although I would like them done a little more on the crunchy side). My sisters favorite is the Snow Pea omelet. She swears it is the perfect combination of crunch and fluff!Each meal starts out with a little basket of mini-muffin heaven. Alas the mini biscuits are no longer served, but man oh man are those zucchini muffins out of this world.So you may be wondering, after all these raves, what are the down sides... well on occasion there is a little more butter on the bottom of the plate than I am comfortable with and although they are supposed to be famous, their sticky buns aren't all that special.If you are looking for decent food, served with a smile, in a unique environment - you will definitely enjoy your visit to Kiss the Cook. Oh and there is that little chocolate kiss that leaves you wanting more...  : )03/19/10Kitschy, fun country-life decor.  There was about a 15-minute waiting time.  Lots of older citizens waiting, which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women.  It's refreshing when a restaurant's setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers-- Mom and I encounter so many "closed" individuals on a daily basis at work, so this is a nice change of pace for us.  Staff here seem friendly and busy, but efficient.  At least, ours was.  One complaint: it's a bit cramped in here.  It would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables, especially when I spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops, and only one was occupied.Can't recall what Mom ordered, but I wasn't surprised that she didn't enjoy it-- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me.  Website does not list a menu, and all I can recall is that it was an omelet w/ a couple of fibrous veggies (snow peas and something else; it was a strange combo, of that I'm sure of.  Chestnuts, maybe?).  I went w/ a Belgian waffle, two eggs, and bacon.  Coffee was weak, but our server offered to brew a stronger pot.  Nice!  While we waited for our selections, she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy, and that we did!  We both really liked the bran.  I also enjoyed the zucchini-- Mom thought she detected cinnamon (not a fave of hers), but I think it's the nutmeg she was referring to.  Then again, I may be mistaken...Waffle was, well, a waffle.  No accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up.  I always bring my own 100% organic maple syrup, because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup, it isn't 100% pure, but a blend of maple and corn syrups.  (If it smells like Mrs. Butterworth's, it isn't 100% maple.  Just sayin'.)  Eggs were cooked to over-medium, just that way I like 'em.  Bacon was very nice.Cute saucer and dinner plates, lovely mini-muffins (we bought extra to-go!), good bacon, and efficient service make for a solid two stars.  I wouldn't mind giving KTC another try, if we're in the area.  Next time we'll try the pancakes and crepes!I have now been here 3 times.  This place is sort of an icon in Glendale and I had been hearing that I had to go here since I moved here 17 years ago.The first time I was here was Mothers Day. and I ordered the special breakfast of chicken crepes with a fruit bowl.  It was cold, the spinach had the texture of shoe leather, the Alfredo sauce had separated then formed a skin.  The fruit bowl it came with was ok as was the coffee and the mini muffins with butter were really good.'The next time I went for lunch and had that day's special which was a  hot turkey sandwich with potato salad.  The sandwich was ok. The potato salad was bland but the seasoned salt on the table made it ok. This last time I had the Cooks breakfast of two pancakes, two eggs, two sausages (or bacon) and I added some potatoes.  The breakfast was lukewarm.  The pancakes and potatoes were pretty good, the eggs and sausage were just ok.  As noted before the mini muffins served with real butter were really good.Ever body I encountered was pleasant.  The place is looking a bit worn.  When I was there the place was one to two thirds full.  I noticed this last trip the line of chairs and the coffee station outside were missing.  I fully understand that the banter between the waitresses and the regular customers is one of the things that brings people back, I just wish it didn't cause my food to be served lukewarm as I saw other plates served that were still steaming.I gave it a 3 but it is a pretty weak 3 and although I would go there again if somebody else picked it I doubt it will make it into my regular rotation.The garden benedict was definitely delicious. Probably my favorite dish here in Kiss the Cook. Not only the food is great here, the place is nice and the service is great as well. The atmosphere is nice too.After all these years, I finally came and tried this establishment.  The parking spaces were limited.  Watch where you park!   A long line was already out the door waiting for a table. Why are brunch places always so busy?  The decor reminded me of Glendale's antique shops. They have a bunch of baskets hanging and other random items surrounded the restaurant. Its interesting decor. Upon entering the restaurant, there was a strong burnt odor in the dining area.  I'm assuming their vents weren't working. I had the Country Breakfast with 2 eggs, biscuits & gravy, and fried potatoes. The biscuits & gravy didn't taste fresh and homemade. Fried potatoes were basically scorched.  They were tasteless and hard.  It helped when you sprinkle with plenty of black peppers.The staff was efficient and friendly.  I love a place still give out free warm muffins. I would return just to order the basket of muffins. It was absolutely delicious.

It's nice when Plan B turns out better than Plan A would have been had it not failed so miserably.  Thanks to Yelp, we did not leave Cave Creek hungry (then again, we never leave anywhere hungry), but we did leave happy.I love the homey feeling this little gem offers.  Alberto himself greets his guests, takes orders, and serves us as if we are family.  Well, maybe not my family, but someone else's much warmer and friendlier family.We quickly devoured the fresh bread and dipping oil, moving on to delicious Caesar salads.  How I love a well-dressed salad.  After seeing one too many episodes of Hell's Kitchen, my husband opted for risotto.  No need to settle on what's offered on the menu, as they will prepare it any way you'd like.  Alberto suggested a seafood risotto with a spicy tomato sauce.  This was perfection with ample shrimp, lobster, scallops and mussels.  The tomato sauce was spicy, but not overpowering.  Alberto does offer one hand-made pasta, fettucini.  I opted for a simple dish of this pasta with fresh tomato and garlic.  The fettucini was perfect, but I found the dish a tad salty and the thickly sliced garlic was not cooked enough IMHO.  I enjoyed the meal, but the risotto was really the star of this show.For dessert, we shared a tart with fig jam.  Alberto's jams are hand-made as well.  Needless to say it was a mistake to share this dessert.  I wanted my own and will have it next time.  And there will be a next time.

I could have had gelato. The G-Spot is also on the way home. I could have had a lot of other things but I was just too lazy to get out of the car.The Beautiful Carin and I were on our way home last night. We attended the terrific Yelp event at La Bocca. I grabbed a biscotto (singular for biscotti) on the way out (delightful...crispy and chocolaty with sweet anise finish) and I really should have been satisfied with that, but Noooooooo! I had to have something else. That turned out to be DQ on Scottsdale Road. If you happen to be going north on Scottsdale Road, you can't successfully "drive through" this DQ unless you successfully "jump the median curb" and "avoid a head on collision"...all possible with all wheel drive, so I was good to go on that front, however, I arrived at the speaker to place my order in a slightly less relaxed state than I had anticipated. So I was less inclined to be forgiving when I ordered a waffle cone and heard my confirmation come back as "&&^&*^~%^^%%$@~%&@%*~^(&(@&(~@^~*^@^@^~*@^". It could have been that they were saying "yes sir, we will have that cone ready for you at the window", but we'll never know.Got my cone ($2.50), and it was already drippy...I know, I know, it's soft serve (that's what she said:), but still, I expect it to maintain a somewhat frosty and cohesive state, and wait until I get out of the drive through before it falls on  my lap. But, I suppose it tasted OK (the part I got to eat instead of wear).So, dripping cone in hand, we now get to try to successfully leave the drive through at DQ and return to our northbound heading...good luck! We were again fortunate that we have all wheel drive, because the driveway is steep enough to be labeled "curb" in most jurisdictions. We bounced out into traffic and now needed to make it across 3 lanes of southbound traffic, make a u-turn across the median and negotiate the northbound traffic flow...with one hand!I was saved by 2 things:I spent part of my youth rodeo-ing (bareback bronc's) and I spent a considerably longer time racing (sports and formula cars). So, even with reflexes and visual acuity dulled by age, I was able to safely negotiate all of the hazards encountered trying to "drive through" DQ.I could have had a cookie.The ice cream stains came right out:)Dairy Queen and their blizzards are obviously amazing, but this review is going to go much deeper than this. This review is going to talk about their blizzard ice cream cakes. Yes you read that right. Blizzard ice cream cakes! For my husband's recent birthday, I opted for his annual ice cream birthday cake but this year, we live in a different area which means the Baskin Robbins ice cream cake wasn't going to cut it. I had heard about the Dairy Queen ice cream cakes, so I decided to give it a try. Blizzard cakes take 48 hours prep time because they are made to order, but I promise you it is worth the weight! I ordered the peanut butter cup blizzard cake. The verdict? My husband was thrilled and so was I! The cake was the perfect combination of ice cream, blizzard mixture, peanut butter cups and fudge cake. If you need a cake for a special occasion, remember that Dairy Queen offers much more than just drive through frozen treats. They also sell delicious cakes!

Pretty darn impressed. The interior is old, drab and clean! The food is hot, yummy and great. Do not let the exterior fool you this is legit food. We had Sun devil Chicken....spicey Chicken fried Rice... perfect Steamed dumpling.. i swear they are homemade Sesame chicken... great flavor and nice chicken, not shitty stuff here. The service is amazing, they packed all the food into a box, taped it all down so it didn't move and gave all the extras you need to enjoy a nice take out. Way to go Tam!

Fresh Mex Open 24hour + free deliveryUnbelievably inexpensive and pretty tasty! What more could you ask for if you're up playing poker online?! The fish tacos were delicious, ended up getting a combo. Unfortunately you'll need to add lime and salt to their guacamole it has very little flavor, and don't forget to ask for hot salsa - the house salsa is pretty mild.Date Rating: N/A (still haven't been to the actual location)Pick up Scale: N/A (I'm sure you can meet interesting locals here late night)Strong Suggestion: Order from here when you're starving.Unfortunately this review is downgraded to a 3 star rating. Time for an update since I have been back a few times after my last visit. As mentioned before their original dba was El Taco Fresco. Everything is the same however I think they have trimmed the portion size of their food and increased prices a bit.I often place my order then walk through the adjoining door to Money Plays bar and grab a beer and wait for my food which they will walk over to me when ready. Mexican food and an ice cold beer is a very nice combination in my book and I am not much of a beer drinker.We ordered rolled tacos, excuse me I mean taquitos as they call them. In San Diego, CA where I am from the old school taco shops call them rolled tacos as they really are. I never heard of the term "taquitos" until I moved to Los Angeles. Anyhow, of course don't forget the cheese and guacamole. Well just don't expect much cheese or guacamole as the amount was laughable and yes they charge extra for guacamole in which they are very stingy with. Only two out of my five taquitos had enough guacamole to enjoy. A pet peeve of mine is if you charge extra for it then make sure you give a fair amount. They were tighter than a ticks as with the guacamole!I was craving carne asada so I got a burrito this visit. I was disappointed in the size as it was very small and not very meaty. If I order a carne asada burrito I want to taste a decent amount of meat. This burrito was the smallest and least filled I have ever had the opportunity to consume.  It did not even look right, it was so small and empty the shape was not even of a burrito but rather more similar to the shape of a pear. I was very disappointed, thank goodness I split an order of "taquitos" with my sweetie or I would have left just as hungry as when I walked in.I will give them some time and check back as I am turned off at the moment. :(The name change in my opinion has only brought higher prices and less food.**NOT A DRUNK REVIEW** LOL.Yes, this place is next to a bar. I come to eat here first AND THEN get hammered. So I seriously remember what I've eaten here before. LOL.I've ordered a bunch of food here before. Carne asada tacos, chicken nachos, carnitas burritos, burgers & fries, and chicken tenders. Yup, they're all good.Service is excellent. If you tell the guy that you're at the bar, they will bring your food to you. Would come back here...hammered. LOL

Over the last couple months I've been bouncing back and forth between the recently purchased new abode and the old house that's currently in escrow.  Numerous meetings with contractors at the new place, back to the old place to meet realtors, contractors, inspectors, blah blah blah.  A few weeks back I decided every time I have to be at the new place to meet a contractor, after the meeting i'll hit a breakfast place.It's been ages since I've been to Lou's so I decided to include it on my breakfast place list.Place looks exactly like it did when I tried it over 4 years ago.  I believe the cook was the same ( is it Lou ? ) Ordered ham steak, eggs o/e, rye toast.  I believe it was $8.  I expected a lower price given low rent district, presumably low overhead given nothing has changed in the place in over 4 years, so maybe the serving size is ala hash house a go go , uhhhhh, that's a negatoryFood was average - a little too much oil puddling on the eggs but not a big deal given the grease in the hash browns.Probably closer to 2.5 stars but I round up given the place for so dang long - props to them.

Review Text :
El Tiacoyo is not your usual Mexican Restaurant. It's Hidalgo Regional Cuisine. That means you can order things like cow foot tacos, cactus soup, head meat tacos, sausage and intestine tacos, huitiacoche cheese crisp, barbacoa, mixotes and so much more!They have weekend specials this past weekend it was lamb tacos but on past visits I saw goat and brain tacos.They start you off with chips and a creamy green very spicy sauce thats very good and a smokey red sauce that's also good and less spicy. We got the huitiacoche  (also known as corn smut or Mexican Truffle) cheese crisp. It's not the Americanized watered down version it's the real stuff. Very earthy and interesting. From what I tried so far from here I've found that they do very good fish dishes here very reasonably priced. They don't use that cheap tilapia or muddy tasting swai fish like other places use. From the two fish dishes I tasted it seems like a very fresh sweet snapper kind of fish. This time I tried what they called grilled fish. When I saw it I thought they gave me the wrong thing because I received an aluminum envelope filled with very moist very fresh tasting fish cooked in juices from tomato and onions and a little butter. By looking at the envelope I think they cooked it on the grill. This dish came with average rice and beans and tortillas. My husband tried the chicken enchiladas, They were made with very fresh tasting chicken and were or mostly were just filled with chicken. The green chili sauce that topped them was very heavy with lime juice.I should mention that this place is not fancy and is very raw looking so you only come here for the food and not the ambiance. It's also hard to see from the street because it's located behind another building.4.5 stars I didn't round up to 5 because of the average rice and beans and lack of atmosphere

Review Text :
OK. Reviewing PF Changs in Phoenix is like reviewing Delux, Barrio Cafe or some other overly reviewed although perhaps well deserving place. That long incorrectly worded sentence aside, I have to say, we had a fantastic Chang experience. Mostly due to the fact that we were buzzed after the fabulously thrown Gabi yelp event. And we didn't choose to wait for a table, yet sat at the bar, with the other drinkers. We quickly made friends with the bar staff, and diners on either side of us. The spring rolls were crisp, hot and well, kinda bland. Thank you sides o sauce. The mushu pork was dee lish as was the Spicy Chang Chicken. However, riding the bland wagon, was the chicken fried rice. Undercooked and totally void of flavor. The sake was hot, just like the electronics were our diners to the left were hawking. Seriously. He went to his car to retrieve things. Thanks. But no thanks. Service was outstanding. Energy in the restaurant was fun. Unusual for me to give 4 stars to a chain restaurant, unless there's and in and an out in the name. But here goes for tonight. Four stars PF. Four stars! More on service and ambiance than food. But four stars nonetheless!I figured it was time for an update for this local (yes, local!) restaurant. Did you know that PF Chang's started in Arizona and in fact, this location is the flag ship restaurant for all the Chang's. That means this restaurant will have updates and changes to the menu before anyone else. This is a good option if you're looking for a decent meal with good service. You know what you're getting here because they have their concept perfected. We recently dined here and had Chas as our waiter. Chas is also a trainer and was not only very knowledgeable but also friendly and suggested tweaks to our food that made it even better. When you dine here, ask to sit in Chas' section!I love and adore the chicken fried rice, but I could make sweet love all-night-long to the northern-style ribs.  How does one make love to ribs?  XXX is how.  Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.Order "off the menu":-- The "real" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good.-- The "Stir-fried Eggplant" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!I took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.No matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.=======================Location specific - Scottsdale=======================1.  Big location, lots of seating, and great outdoor area.2.  Late night happy hour - yay!  When the temp of the nights in AZ are in the 70's --- sitting outside is supreme3.  Yelp check-in offer, free order of dim sum - edamame potstickers (yum!)

Restaurant name  Koji Sushi Bar and China Bistro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
On my recent trip back to Vegas we had the opportunity to try Koji out while we were at The Orleans Casino for the first time.  Generally we would just be here for the Orlean's buffet but since we were sort of buffet out we decided to give this place a try.  It actualy pleasantly surprised our party!First of all, we were here little before noon so the place was only occupied by 3 tables...  Then as time passes by, a good amount of crowd actually were building up so I'm glad to see that happen with any restaurant large or small.Checked the prices out and it was slightly steeper than what I was hoping but with the craving for sushi we decided to give it a try...Here is what we've ordered...Who's your daddy roll:  Totally delicious!  Yes it was more expensive than other places but man it sure was good.  Delicious tempura shrimp & I believe avocado wrapped in sushi rice topped with sashimi with sauce... so delicious!  I think I can just get this only next time around!  Tried a couple of dishes on the menu too! (aside from the sushi)  It was actually really good!--Braised Pork Belly with Chinese Mustard Greens:  So bomb!  The pork belly were so tender, soft, and perfectly simmered in a soy sauce based soup that is actually not overly salty.  (If I only had some BAOs with me this would of so made my day!)  The portion of these pork belly were huge too!  Easily 8 slices of 1/2" of porky joy!  I can still conjure the image of how it was melting in my mouth!  WOW!--Steamed Tofu in lotus leaves with shaved Scallops:  Another awesome one!  The tofu itself was light, airy, fluffy, and hot!  The sauce that goes on top of the freshly steamed tofu was just the rigth balance of flavor once again with the melody of mushrooms + shaved scallops... what a perfect balance to the pork bellies!!!--Pan fried beef noodles:  You know, this dish is actually quite good but I'm not a pan fried noodle type of guy (I don't like it anywhere but others love it so I just have to deal with it)  It was tasty but just not my type of dish to enjoy.Service was attentive and effective.  No problems here!So after finally tasting Koji for the first time after so many trips to Orleans would I go back?  Yes!  Who's Your Daddy + Pork Belly truly got me hooked!  Unfortunately it is a casino environment and cost will be much higher than say at Chinatown area, but if you are doing your gambling here at The Orleans, I would definitely recommend you give this place a try!(P.S.  Pork Belly I believe it's a special that comes and goes... so if you are into juicy, tender, and absolutely pork belly cuts, you better get some now!)

Review Text :
Another chain I have visited recently.  Good place to catch Red Sox games if you don't have an MLB package with your cable or Direct TV.  If you need to take proactive steps in order to consume a food is that good?  I really like the habanero mango sauce.  On Thursdays they have .60 chicken fingers (boneless wings) and I have gone a couple times and had them with the habanero sauce.Problem is the sauce is very hot.  Spicy hot.  When you eat it.  As it works it's way through your system.  As it works it's way out of your system.  Spicy.If you order wings ask for them crispy.  They will cook them a little more and give them the nice crunchiness just like at home.Other than wings and boneless and beer Buffalo Wild Wings is probably a two star joint.

Review Text :
Scottsdale's Last Real Cowboy Saloon... I totally thought I'd reviewed Rusty Spur before as I've been more times than I can count.  I'll agree with most of the positive reviews already written about this place - it's laid back, un-pretentious, hole-in-the-wall, and fun!I'm not a huge country music fan either, but when I come to Rusty Spur, I love it!  You can't help but smile and have a great time at this place!  If I don't start out here at Happy Hour, I end the night here whenever I'm out in Old Town.  I'm left with a souvenir tank top that Jared bought me in his drunken state the other night when we were hanging at the Spur.  It says:ALL JACKED UPBig TimeSince 1951RUSTY SPUR SALOONScottsdale, AZIt's cute, but not quite as wonderful as entering into the doors of the Rusty Spur and leaving your troubles behind to enjoy the country music and cowboys that surround you!After the Elite event at Iruna, my Yelp posse; Dante Dolores Anna Mike and I (name drop!!) decided to chase the evening with mas cervezas, at a place Dante lovingly referred to as "The Rusty Trombone". We stumbled to the western theme bar with two birds i'd been chatting up in toe, whose boring names escape me. As we made our approach we could hear a lone singer/guitarist gilr crooning away to Fleetwood Mac and as my mates snickered a smile formed across my lips as I nostalgically thought of my Mum. We settled ourselves at a table and got some drinks, and some more drinks and even more drinks, after that the night was a blur. I recall us all getting rowdy and tipping the singer girl, and after every tip she'd ring a cowbell of some sort and we'd all cheer and holler. really we kept tipping her out of the sheer novelty of the cowbell im assuming...well at least i was. She kept referring to us as virgins, as it was our first time at the "rusty trombone", so as virgins she honored us with a song request- I wasted no time "COCAINE BLUES!!!!" i shouted, to a few mumbled giggles from the regulars- The Grizzled and bad ass bar tender actually sang the lyrics as the guitarist girl played the tune, and in the most stellar karaoke esque rendition of johnny cash he bellowed out the lyrics to a T! as i sang along drunkenly, probably embarrassing my yelp mates and the two boring birds i'd chatted up at Iruna, some regular swayed past me and pawed at my tousled mop of hair. I recall going to the bathroom and returning to find Jimmy the grizzled barkeep adoringly belting out a ballad to the more attractive of boring girls we'd brought along much to her embarassment and horror, at some point they took their boring selves to their boring homes and we kept drinking and forging bonds that could rival the best of Yelp cliques! I will never forget...well what i remember from that night i will never forget...LOL!Thanks to my newest Yelp friends and thanks to the Rusty Trombone for making a great evening that much greater!In the wild wild southwest there lives a saloon. A saloon that has been around for years and years. In fact, this saloon takes credit for being the first saloon in Scottsdale. No matter what's going on outside the doors on the streets of Old Town; whether it be crowded during spring training or 115 degrees and dead, it's always the same inside the Rusty Spur. The moment you step foot through the doors, you're immediately transformed into a time warp when John Waynes ruled the city and two stepping was the only dancing worth doing in this desert. This is one of my favorite saloons in Old Town. Here, it doesn't matter how much your outfit cost, what kind of purse you have, what your wearing or who you're with. As long as you're ready to have a good time in a crowded setting with plenty of live country music, you're welcome. Here, everyone treats you like a friend and nobody gets upset if their drink spills a little because someone two stepped right into their arm. Here, it doesn't matter if it's 1:00 PM or 1:00 AM because the atmosphere will be the same with most likely the same cover Country band performing. This is truly a gem in Scottsdale. There's a reason it's been around since the beginning and will most likely stick around until the end.Visited this "saloon" in Old Town, Phoenix but I was severely disappointed.  Was looking for a nice place to listen to some country and maybe do a little dancing with the wifey and heard this was the place to go....Nope!  The place is horribly small, no room to even stand in there much less make it to the bar to get a drink.  The music was live but I'm not a big fan of the whole "give me a tip and I'll play you a song" deal.  How about you play some good songs and then I'll give you a tip.  I will not be going back and I don't recommend.

Located in the Safeway shopping center on the northeast corner of Scottsdale & Pinnacle Peak, this Jade Palace may seem far for some of you, but for some of us living in North Phoenix / Scottsdale, it's the best Chinese around!Jade Palace is a regular in my rotation of consistent dine-in and take-out restaurants and has been for years.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the service is attentive.  The hostesses are always sweet and if you place a take-out order, they make sure that they read your order back to you to avoid any confusion.My favorite dishes are the healthy choice steamed shrimp (or chicken) and veggies, mu shu chicken, and dry sauteed string bean.  Their soups are all really good as well.  The saying 'never order fish in a Chinese Restaurant' does not hold true at Jade Palace - go for it... it's delicious!Devlan, the Manager & Co-owner, can often be found at this location and he is extremely personable and makes sure that all of his customers have a pleasant experience... Whether I'm coming from the gym in workout clothes or I'm dressed from work, dining solo or with a group, I always feel welcome at Jade Palace.  For the food and the service, this is a fantastic restaurant.  If you like Chinese food, check out Jade Palace - I'll see you there!

I've been going here for many years. Actually since well before the new owner(s) came in and renamed it Stray Cat. For a long time, I really enjoyed the drink and dinner specials.I've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year. Earlier this year, I brought some of my visiting family to the business because the food and service had been so awesome to that point. For some reason, they had a useless cook working that day who burnt everything he sent out to us ... twice. The owner on site was so embarrassed after we showed him what was served, he offered us gift cards to cover our food. My family vowed never to return. I figured it was a fluke and was impressed that the owner acknowledged the problem and did something to address it.In June, I went in on a Monday and ordered a basket of chicken wings. To my surprise, they were completely out of wings. I ended up going elsewhere to eat that night and sent Stray Cat a private message on their Facebook account letting them know what happened. A month to the day I received a response, "That was a busy weekend for us. We never want to let a loyal customer down. Hope you'll be back to 'Fix' your wing cravings soon."In August, I went in on a Sunday and again ordered a basket of chicken wings. I was stunned because they again were completely out of wings. I sent a followup message to Stray Cat via Facebook letting them know of the pattern and advising they should speak with whomever is doing the product ordering. Their ENTIRE response:      "Maybe eat wings on Friday or Saturday when we're fully stocked"WOW! I immediately went to the bar and requested to speak to the owner who had ironically "just left". I gave a printout of the messages sent back and forth to a server who knows me well, told her what happened and asked to have the owner contact me. No contact what so ever.If this is how they treat a longtime patron now, imagine what this place is headed for. Save your money for a business that actually cares about the people bringing cash through the door. That snarky message was it for me. I'm done.

Restaurant name  Denny's

I have been to this Denny's many ,many times over the years. It is close and easy to go to. It is your standard Denny's.The coffee is so so , the staff works hard ,and the food is doable.It has always seemed to be very clean,even the restrooms.There is lots of parking in the lot.The place is always packed,at least most times of the day. Except mid afternoon, that is a much calmer time of day here. Food is very inexspensive so it is always a deal.It is right off the freeway as well, which makes it most convienant for all.Cruise the strip...pass by McD's, Jack in the Box, Del Taco, etc...etc...Everyone's hungry...pointing fingers at this place and that place...Until the majority points four fingers at a Dennys...They coulda dropped me off at those other places n picked me up laterThey ordered breakfast.... looked tasty...I ordered a double cheeseburger combo for breakfast..I git these two huge clumps of meat patties inside the bun..  I tossed one patty to the side...   Burger was dry n tasteless and gross.Fries were soft..  I like my fries burnt a crispyI got pieces of burnt hash brown from my friend's plates and a muffinWhen I think of Denny's I think of a nice, quiet night with an amazing selection of food, drinks, and dessert. You come to Denny's because it's convenient, the food is good, and it's all well-priced. So obviously, this is one of my favorite places. One time, after an all-nighter, I came here with my GF at 5 a.m. and it was the best. It's never too full, which means the service is always fast.The breakfast food is my favorite - I could eat breakfast day and night and I'd get it from here. I'm not a huge fan of the dinner items (fish, burgers, etc.), but it's because of my personal preference on the type of cuisine, not the establishment's food itself. Yesterday we came here because we were too lazy to cook at home LOL and we wanted pancakes. Our server was Michael - he was amazing! He got all our stuff to us very quickly, and I'm pretty sure he was the only waiter waiting on about five or six tables. I'm hoping next time we go to Denny's we'll get him again. :)I'm giving Denny's three stars because it's Denny's...I mean, can you get better food elsewhere? Sure. Can you get better service somewhere else? Yeah, maybe. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still good and it's....cozy. It's not "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" and it shouldn't be (in my opinion) because then that means it's so hyped up that it would always be crowded. And yes, I'm a fan - but I say A-OK because it's a term my grandpa uses to describe something that's pleasant and familiar. It's the old, married couple enjoying dinner after 65 years together; it's the mom and her child coloring outside the lines. Pleasant and familiar :)

Restaurant name  Pete's Fish & Chips
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Really? What exactly are they famous for??After living in Glendale for about 5 years, seeing people drive around with Pete's bumper stickers, and detouring around 55th and Glendale at rush hour because the drive-through line backs up into the road, we finally tried this. In the end I just have to ask what all of their "fans" are thinking.The fish that's so famous looks and tastes like something you might get from the frozen food section of the store. But only if you got the cheapest store brand possible and made sure it was a SQUARE patty of frozen breaded fish. The fish sandwich was one of the aforementioned fish patties on a cheapo hamburger bun with a smear of sauce. The fries were questionable. Honestly, I'd rather eat fish at Long John Silver's than eat here again.HEY all you Yelpers out there...Howz come it always seems that whenever a restaurant, diner or eatery hits on a successful recipe they wanna tweek it?  Even a lowly place like Pete's is no exception. Years ago, back in the 60's, they hit on one at Pete's. The fried shrimps were outstanding! Nice large juicy shrimps coated in a light crispy batter similar to tempura made it destination dining. Being inexpensive and delicious they appealed to the masses. When I returned from a tour in the USMC, it was beckoning for me to return. Went to the one on South Central and ordered a large shrimp and chips only to find heavily battered deep fried minced shrimps. Disappointed I ate them anyways.Soon, I got used them and continued to go to Pete's. Now fast forward to the present. They are now mass produced minced shrimps coated with bread crumbs then stamped into the shape of a shrimp and deep fried, identical to frozen ones found at any grocery store except they are now more expensive and come with only a handful of French fries! So sad,,,not likely to return unless someone else picks up the tab. I never turn down free food usually!Progress? Bah! 2 stars for the food being hot and convenient.

Maybe its just me...I've never had buffalo wings that have ever blown me away.  Most of them are done the same way everywhere.  I honestly can't tell that much of a difference between this place and any Buffalo Wild Wings although the wing meat at Mac's was pretty dry and some of the drumettes barely had any meat on them.  Definitely a one and done place for me.  Not worth the trek from SW Vegas for.So disappointing! I heard such great things about Johnny Mac's but after having pizza there for dinner, I am far from impressed...I went in with my husband on a Monday night. We were seated in a booth that had ice on the seat, leaving me with a lovely wet spot on my ass. The hostess asked what we would like to drink but didn't know what beers they had. Perhaps management should consider not having drink orders taken by a young girl that doesn't even appear to be old enough to serve liquor...? A second employee came by with our waters a few minutes later. We looked over the menu, waiting for one of the multiple waitresses that walked by to stop and acknowledge us. Finally someone came over, gave us an excuse about how no one knew whose table we were, and took our order. We went with a large mushroom pizza. I debated getting wings since I heard such good things about them but decided to pass. The pizza didn't take long to come out, it felt like we waited longer to order then we did for the food. Upon first glance, the pizza was all good. Nice thin crust that was golden brown, lots of cheese, plenty of mushrooms. The cheese was tasty, as were the mushrooms. The crust was like rubber though, when I picked up a piece to try to take a bite it flopped over. The only part of the crust with any crunch to it was the edges. Pretty disappointing. If I had never heard of Johnny Mac's, this would be my first and only time visiting. Since I live nearby I will probably give them another shot sooner or later... Everyone has an off night at some point, right?Very dive-y looking in the front.We decided to try it out a few months ago when I was pregnant.Wasn't terribly impressed. We ordered a meat plate/sampler, that just had the meat and cheese thrown on there. When our pizza finally came, there was a pool of grease sitting on top of it. I've had it better frozen, out of a box.For whatever reason, we decided to give them a second chance, with delivery, about a month later.There was a mile long black hair baked into our pizza. NO thanks, never again.Johnny Mac's is a strip mall restaurant/bar one could drive by without even noticing- but you should take notice.  Most of the items we've had at Johnny Mac's have been fantastic and reasonably priced.  Another thing that makes this place is great is that it's smoke free.  Believe me, when you first walk in, you expect a cloud of smoke.If you're going for draft beer, consider the $10.50 pitcher to share.  It is a good deal and priced better than buying individual pints.Tonight we had the Beef on Weck special.  If you are not familiar with this Buffalo, NY specialty, it's thin cut roast beef on a toasted kimmelweck roll with a side of au jus.  Johnny's serves it with fries and a pickle.  I've now had this dish twice, and both times it was fantastic.  The meat could be a little rarer, but it is definitely tender and flavorful.  But, to me, this sandwich is all about the roll.  It makes the sandwich superb.We also had the wings tonight, but they were out of the watermelon BBQ sauce I love and the wings were not crispy tonight.  I am not a fan of chewy skin on my wings, so I took a pass on the rest after one bite.After coming for dinner multiple times and take out (pizza) a couple times, I would definitely recommend it to others and will be back.

I saved my 100th Yelp review for my Birthday dinner, and a very special restaurant. Alize, on top of the Palms is and exquisite place to eat with a spectacular view, and a huge wine list that is actually presented to you on an iPad. Atmosphere - 5 View - 5 Food - 5 Wine - 5 Service - 5 Overall Experience - 5 If you are eating at this restaurant, you need to order the 7 course chef tasting menu and the wine pairing. The cost will be about $200 per person when you are all finished, but believe me, if you are looking for a stellar experience, amazing food, wine, service and overall execution, you need to order this. Each dish arrived with a glass a wine that was perfectly paired with the food. As a sommelier, I truly appreciate a perfect wine and food pairing, and I was not disappointed. The staff was amazing - professional, cordial, loved their job, and couldn't have done a better job. I was impressed. I will eat here again when I visit Las Vegas...I am already wondering what the new items will be on the chef pairing menu...and of course, what delicious wines I will find perfectly paired.This is a swanky place reserved for special occasions. We dined here on a Sunday and there were only couple of other tables occupied. The view is very romantic as the restaurant is located on the 54th floor of The Palms. It is one of those places that is uncomfortably quiet with elevetor-esque music playing. My boyfriend kept on whispering at first until we got more comfortable and adjusted to the atmosphere. Our server was extremely attentive and had a great attitude. We started off with some cocktails. The wine and cocktail list is presented on the Ipad and left at your table so you can browse the several categories. Once you see something that you like you simply select to order it. Boyfriend had the Devil's Pancake which was a bourbon based drink and extremely potent and delicious. The ginger after taste was just amazing. I had a vodka based cocktail called French (and some # which I forgot). It was extremely delicious..it had Grey Goose and a sugared rim..with fresh raspberries garnish. So good!The menu features a la carte menu or the chef's 7course tasting menu which was $125. We opted to go the a la carte route this time. As an appetizer we had Seared Pork Belly which was pretty good...it came with white cheddar polenta under and a quail egg on top. On the first bite I though the pork belly tasted a little overcooked..but combined with the polenta and runniness of the egg it worked really well. As an entree I opted for the good ol Filet Mignon medium and boyfriend went with Almond Crusted Rack of Colorado Lamb also medium. My contention was that my steak was unevenly cooked, yet his lamb was pretty consistently medium. The fact that my steak was not cooked evenly is the reason I am taking off a star. If I am at a place where I am paying over $50 for a small piece of meat, I'd prefer it blow me away. I would say given the option I would have gone for the lamb as that was just perfect. We opted to skip dessert and order another round of cocktails instead. At the end of dinner we asked the waiter to take our picture who responded with "It would be my pleasure." That was very gracious of him. We definitely did not experience any of the snootiness or bad attitude from any of the staff that some of the other reviews mention. It was a great restaurant for a perfect romantic evening out.My husband made reservations at this restaurant for my birthday dinner. We had reservations at 6:30 and had the restaurant to ourselves for a good 45 minutes before any other guests arrived. We had a window table with a fantastic view of the strip from the Stratosphere all the way down to Mandalay Bay, as this restaurant is on the 56th floor of the ivory tower in the Palms Hotel/Casino.We arrived and our waiter Salvano greeted us and took our drink orders. We ordered off of the tasting course menu. This menu consist of 7 courses. You have a choice of 3 options for each course including one vegetarian option. So the variations are numerous. My husband and I decided to get different entrees for each course to maximize our experience to taste as much of the menu as possible.The first course was a complimentary sampling from the chef. It was pheasant with filo dough wrap, with a strawberry puree, and a cauliflower puree soup. It was a nice surprise to start the evening from the chef.1st course: Russian Golden Ostera caviar and Truffle caviar.($20 supplement)2nd course: Ribeye Carpaccio and Maine Lobster and herb salad3rd course: Sauteed foie gras and Chilled terrine of foie gras4th course: King crab leg croustillant and Tempura calamari5th course: Sauteed Dove Sole and Red Snapper6th course: Aged beef ribeye and Spring rabbitChef palate cleanser consist of meringue coating around grapefruit puree and poppyseed sauce.7th course. Gran Marinier souffle and Chocolate souffle.Overall the dishes were decent size. The variety and flavors in each course made it so unique and delicious. With the foie gras the waiter recommended a glass of Sauternes wine, which was a pairing. The service was impeccable, even when it got busy the wait staff worked as a team to keep up the incredible service. Every waiter was knowledgeable and described in detail each dish as they served it. The view is priceless especially as dusk turned to night and you could see a clear view of the strip lighting up. Awesome!!. Walked out feeling as if we had spent the day at the spa. Totally relaxed and satisfied. Definitely recommend Alize for a very special occasion.What do you do to impress your wife on your anniversary?  Take her to Alizé.I was concerned we'd be too early to see the lights come on as the sun set.  It got dark quickly and we enjoyed the view in both daylight and after dark.  We were seated promptly and as was the case when I ate here before, service was excellent.  We were soon brought two iced teas and then we ordered.We were brought an amuse-bouche of crab in panna cotta on one side and a small piece of foie gras on the other.  One of the runners soon came with a selection of three breads--lavash, regular baguette, and a gluten free roll.  We each took some lavash and the roll.  The roll had great flavor.For the first course, I got the smoked salmon with fried egg and Andrea got the Roasted mushroom Toban-Yaki with miso-mushroom broth.  The plating on my appetizer was just a delight and it was so flavorful!  Andrea enjoyed her toban-yaki and I got a chance to try some of the mushrooms.  Great flavor.For our main courses, I got the beef rib eye and Andrea got the chicken breast with sausage stuffing and chestnuts.  Both were very good.  I finished a small amount of her chicken and I can attest to how good it was.  My beef was perfect.Dessert--I chose the chocolate soufflé and Andrea got the warm peach galette with almond marzipan ice cream.  Two more winners!  After dessert, a runner came with a trolley on which were placed several mignardises from which to choose.  We got two each and it was a pleasant ending to the meal.I got coffee with dessert and it was strong and flavorful!Let me say again how good service was!  Silvano and his crew were on their game during our stay there.  The staff was polite, friendly, and very accommodating.  It was a wonderful dinner with a great view in one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.We were fortunate to arrive at Las Vegas on restaurant week. And read that Alize had one of the best view in Las Vegas and decided to give it a try. We had the front seat and were not disappointed by the view. We had the complimentary carrot soup and small piece of foie gras to start and some bread to fill our tummy while we wait.I ordered the following:Roasted Beets With Aged Goat Cheese, Quinoa, Port Braised Cipollini Onion, Arugula And Truffle VinaigretteI loved the harmony of flavor with the aged goat cheese and the mildly sweet beets. I couldn't really taste the truffle, but it was great nonetheless. If you are not a fan of beets, stay away.Sauteed Irish Salmon With Black Olive Puree, Sauteed Spinach, Artichoke Ravioli And Limoncello NagThe salmon was cooked right to perfection, a second more would've spoiled the salmon. The most surprisingly p art was the artichoke ravioli which had a black cover. The flavor was plain, but with the limoncello sauce and the black pasta skin, it was interestingly delightful.Caramel Crunch Banoffee With Toasted Coconut CreamI liked the flavor and the texture, but had a hard time eating it with my spoon. The tart shell is extremely hard with the caramel crunch crusted on the bottom. I risked clinking the plate a few times, but go through with it with no plates broken.Overall, if you have a romantic outing or proposal or anything in that sort, this is the place.I came here for dinner Saturday evening with a friend.  We did the 7 course tasting menu.  I am not going to go into each course in detail.  It was the summer tasting menu on the restaurant's web page.  Suffice it to say the food was good, the company was excellent, and the view was stunning as always.This was my 4th time to Alizé and most likely my last.  The reason for this came at the end of the meal.  When we got the bill, we noticed we were charged for the caviar course but we didn't order the posted $20 supplement for the one caviar.  When brought to the attention of our captain, she condescendingly stated that she always tells everyone that there is an additional charge for the caviar course--that it's not one of the 7 courses.  Well, this time she didn't, but she was sure she was right.  The online menu has subsequently been changed so there's little chance for confusion.  The amount was taken off the bill but she missed the point totally.  Her customer service was awful!This was one of my favorite places to go because of the food and the view.  I can get good food elsewhere and there are other places in town with a great view and great food, too.  How's that for a "twist" in my feelings?Adieu, Alizé.This is a fine dining establishment on one of the top floors at the Palms. It seemed on the small side. Elegant enough, but kind of bland decor. However, the view is the star of the show here. It's a great view of Vegas and the Strip.The service is impeccable of course. Very fine dining. We went during Restaurant Week. We were handed every menu except the RW one. No one mentioned RW. It was like a super secret thing they didn't want to encourage. And our server's face confirmed that suspicion when I said we wanted to do the RW offering. And it kinda felt like we were looked down upon from then on.For an appetizer, I opted for the escargot. It was good. Not great or amazing, but definitely good. James O. got the french onion soup. It was fabulous.For an entree, I had the salmon. This was the first time I had ever been asked in a restaurant how I wanted my salmon cooked. I went with the server's recommendation. And that turned out rather raw for me. I honestly would've enjoyed the salmon much more if it had been more cooked. But that's my own fault. The salmon sat atop asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes, and was topped with king crab and bernaise sauce. The asparagus was good. The mashed potatoes were wonderful. The king crab was divine. The bernaise sauce was great. James O. got the filet mignon with green peppercorn sauce. It was perfectly cooked and very tasty. When they brought the entrees, they were covered with those fancy silver domes. And the domes were lifted off both of our plates at the exact same time with a flourish. It was a cool touch that made us feel fancy.For dessert, I had the creme brulee and James O. had a lemon fruit tart thing. The creme brulee was great. The tart was kinda meh. They also brought around a candy cart and we got two of each of these different homemade candies. They were all awesome.All in all, it was a pleasant and tasty dining experience.I cannot believe this unfinished review on one of my favorite restaurants has been sitting there for exactly one year! Since I started the drat, we have been back there an additional 3 times. That says something about how much we enjoy Alize. So what makes a restaurant truly memorable? Is it simply saying, "that place was great"? Or is it posting a few pictures on Yelp and giving it 5 stars? Well yes. But for me, I found myself actually missing Alize and their tasting menu, and wanting to go back and experience it all over again. After my first visit in 2010, Alize became, and still remains one of my favorite restaurants. It's the first place we thought of when we made plans for a celebration in Vegas. The service is consistently top notch. The view of The Strip is unrivaled. And of course ... the food, absolutely amazing!We ordered the Summer tasting menu in early September '14. A Fall / Winter tasting menu in January '15 and another tasting menu in May '15. Their consistency was unmatched. Each course came out at near perfect timing. Dirty dishes do not stay on our table long as there seems to be staff members lurking in the darkness, waiting for us to put our utensils down. I won't go over each course individually as their creative menu changes with the season, and could possibly be quite different when you go. But I can state with certainty the plating, the combination of flavors, the view and service makes the entire experience memorable. If I had to complain about something (let's face it, there's no 'perfect' place) is a course called Etorki. I recall it to be a dry cheese course that just didn't work well with my palette and the tasting menu. Also, unless they did a recent remodel, but the men's restroom looks like it belongs at a truck stop. It's small, dark and dingy with an old paper towel dispenser. It's very unlike the whole Alize experience. But I didn't go there to use the restroom. I return to indulge in the whole incredible dining experience provided by the incredible chef and team at Alize.  Highly recommended! Notes: * Top of the Palms. Depending on what time of year you go, reserve a table when the sun sets. The Strip view is incredible as the sky changes color during sunset.* If you ask nicely for a table facing the Strip during the reservation process, they might accommodate, because they are just awesome! * If you're driving to the Palms, remember which garage you parked at. Apparently there are 3 exits and after a few drinks, we forgot where we parked. * Weeknights tend to be a bit less crowded* Excellent place for any type of special occasion.

Probably the worst place I have ever walked into.I would guess that the ONLY time you will ever walk in here is when you are half way to either San Diego or Arizona.  This town (if you can call it that) seems like nothing more than a pit stop for food and gas before your next one hour drive to civilization.I walked in to what appeared to be a run down diner with a gift shop and a picture of a space ship on the wall.  By far the ONLY reason to walk in here is to get a picture of the space ship (you can see mine posted on Yelp).  I smiled, got my picture taken, and then drove straight to Taco Bell (probably the number one or two place to eat in this town).I am sure you will do the same.Please note:  I did not eat or try their food.  My review is based on the look and feel of the location.

Fart Face? Apparently I can't eat a shitty meal without being the subject of pointless ridicule. Maybe if I was as high off of my own ego as one reviewer (let's call her "Dog Shit"), I would've enjoyed the charcoal briquettes trying to pass as lamb kabobs DS recommended. Or the oil pouches masquerading as the 'traditional' fried eggplant app I've had at many Med eateries....maybe 'ingenuity' was the wrong word -- 'flavor' was sufficient -- but wtf? Is that what this spat is about? Word choice? 'Rebellious iconoclast' is redundant, but I don't get my rocks off on scrutinizing sloppy diction on a fucking food reviewing website. DS is defensive b/c I had a bad meal at a restaurant she likes. BFD! This is about the food, not you, DS. It's always about the food! I could give two shits about what you or your cadre of ass-kissing lemmings who drool over every SAT word and spunky made-up phrase populating your reviews think about Kabob Palace. I just want tasty food. Maybe it was an off night -- who knows. But unless you're paying, I'm not going back.So let's just boil this shit down to its essence: The food I ate SUCKED. Get over it.

Greatest gyros in town! Paul C. and myself tried one of the more expensive, fancier, Rep rated trend joints and there was no comparison. What they lack in atmosphere they make up for with delicious food and great service! One time I spilled tzaziki sauce on my shoe and nearly ate it without thinking...that's how good the stuff is. They would be the perfect sunday lunch place if only they were open on Sunday.Wow, so good Mom and I ate  take out twice this week for lunch !!!  The Gyros were done  very well, ready for pick up and the salads are tasty. Their bread is great  even eaten alone .I don't know what else to say about this place that hasn't already been said... but it is honestly the BEST Mediterranean spot in the valley. Gyros, shawarma, hummus, french fries, kabob... and get this: they also make homemade pasta! Absolutely delicious. It's a family owned restaurant and I had such a nice conversation with the owner; she's a sweetheart and is hands on with everything about the business. ALWAYS order the tzatziki sauce with everything you get!

Feeling like pizza and being in the area of Uncle Joe's meant that something good was in store for dinner.We parked in a dirt lot on Ogden and 6th. It is free and plenty of other cars are parked there and I have seen security walk by it before. It isn't that far of a walk to Fremont St from here.Upon entering Uncle Joe's there was luckily one table left! They have a TV and some college game was on that people were going crazy over. We change up what we get each time. This trip we got a large pepperoni pizza and 2 fountain drinks. The total for that was $13.65! You can't beat it! The pizza was made fresh and brought to our table with plates, silverware and napkins. It was delicious as always. If you have any left overs they will give you to go boxes.The inside is very clean. The moment someone gets up from a table to leave there is someone wiping down the table. If you don't prefer fountain drinks they to offer sodas in a can. I saw Pepsi and Cherry Pepsi.If you like cheese steak sandwiches then you must try the one here. It is made fresh to order and is very good.Uncle Joe's pizza has just become my favorite place to get a New York Style of pizza (AKA Thin Crust) in LV. LOCATED in downtown LV in the newer portion of Fremont Street past the light show experience and across Insert Coins.  Their PIZZA has all the quality's of a thin crust that I love. First, they use just the right amounts of cheese. Let me explain what the right amount of cheese is to me. Other pizza joints will use too little, making the cheese blanket too thin which in turn will cause the tomato sauce to over power, or they will put too much turning the cheese almost to a glue like texture. Here, they use the perfect balance. Second, the crust. OMG the crust the crust. The crust here is light and crispy. If I had to describe it, I would say somewhat similar to a thick potato chip. But not to crispy where it's tough like cardboard either. In comparison to others, most other thin crust pizzas have very soft crust which makes it limp. Which is why you have to fold the pizza in half before you eat it. Now I know what your thinking, that's the way pizza is supposed to be and its nostalgic to eat it like that and so on...and your right but this crust is pretty good too. Last but not least, the pepperoni was crispy like bacon and had the right spice to my liking. The pizza has just the right amount of grease/oil to it but definitely not overflowing.PRICE is excellent. You can purchase a pretty decent size slice for around 3 to 4 bucks or the whole pie.  The ENVIRONMENT here is small with only a few tables. So if there is no seats then its best to take your slice to go. SERVICE here is good. They don't smile at you when you enter but they do however greet you, take your order, quickly get your slice, and tell you good-bye on the way out. What more can you ask for.  Overall, I love this place. I will definitely make this place a must stop on every trip and If I lived in LV then I would be picking up pizza from these guys all the time.

When you make the assertion that a place has "The best F'ing veggie burgers on the PLANET" and throw your arms up in the air in exclamation, you better know why you are talking about. Being that I have been a vegetarian for over 14 years now, I have had a LOT of veggie burgers and I hate to burst your bubble, Dally G, this is NOT the best F'ing veggie burger on the planet. It was tasty, I will give you that, but only because it was smothered with sweet jalapeno sauce, pepper-jack cheese and fresh jalapenos. I am not a fan of those garden patty's. Nor my soggy fries. Both times I have been here it was pretty packed. The first time, on a Sunday, the service was horrible and the waitress was quite the snob. Fortunately last nights visit was quite a bit better, but I think that is because our waitress wanted to give me the business. So... they have some good specials, I will give them that. The food is okay. The service leaves a little something to be desired. I couldn't figure out which bathroom I was supposed to use and the parking is pretty bad. but, they do have a cool patio with fire pits.  Because I am nice and the coffee is good this morning I am rounding up my 2.5 stars to a 3.Could I give this place NO STARS???My girlfriend and I head in and sit down with a group of friends already there. We smile and wave at the waitress to let her know more people joined and she purposely makes us wait at least 10 minutes.I am not a fan already... but yes, it gets worse, people. She brings our drinks out after another table sits down and orders theirs. Our friends are catching on and order a round. Get them before ours. Gosh, does she discriminate against blondes?? I am wondering. Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings. Didn't get it.At this point I go up to the manager and ask if the gal is super busy tonight or if something is up in the kitchen. No, and no. I tell him what's going on and he tells me he'll come out in a moment.Oh... that moment was priceless. He actually said we were rude to her and should be lucky she even continued to serve us. He must be screwing her so I am OUT OF THERE! My tip to folks. Sit at the bar if you must go. There are plenty of other spots out there that will treat you wayyyyyyyy better, have better service, food and prices.THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! I wish I could give it no stars. I had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week. Their PR person contacted me and asked more about it, so I told them. They asked if they could pass my information along to the Director of Operations/Owner and I received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that I am a self-righteous b*tch who knows nothing about customer service and I only care about myself. Todd Goldman, the owner who so kindly took "the time to teach young girls like [me] life lessons" about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that I "get so mad and take it so personally that [I] fail to think rationally while [I] struggle with the idea that [I am] not the most important person in the world". Apparently my "myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of [myself] are staggering". Whatever he may feel about me, I do know one thing about him: I will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again. This does not seem to bother Mr. Goldman because, as he told me in his letter from this evening, according to him, "[I] feel that [I] am so influential in this community that [my] posting will dissuade people from visiting [their] establishments". I only wish I could attach the PDF letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it. I cannot imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer, and yes, I do hope that people read this and see that they should pick Fox Sports Grill, Half Moon, Blue 32, Firehouse Bar and Grill, Duke's, American Junkie or any of the 1000 other sports bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix to enjoy their bar food, beer and sports viewing. It is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and Mr. Goldman should be ashamed of himself.***ADDITION 10/19/2010***I was currently in the building with 11 guests, sitting at a 6 person table when I asked to be accommodated.  I was not asking him to "hold" tables for us, I was asking that they take care of  "actual customers".

Review Text :
I finally dined at Chicago Joe's after long wanting to sample the classic Italian fare of this downtown fixture.  Despite high hopes for a great meal, after finishing a five-course dinner here I am sorry to report that I was underwhelmed by very uninspired cooking.  An appetizer of Arancini, served with duo sauces of Marinara and Alfredo, was okay, but on the dry side.  Unwarmed Italian Bread and butter, and a beany bowl of Pasta Fagioli, tasted good.  A fairly simple salad of greens, a couple of tomato slices, a touch of carrot, and a black olive, with a Vinaigrette Dressing was fine but nothing special.  And then came the really disappointing entry!My $33 entree of Veal & Peppers, with mushrooms and onions and an included pasta side, was extremely pedestrian.  Beyond pounding, the veal was ultra-thin, not very tender, and actually resembled luncheon meat.  And the strands of peppers that topped the meat seemed like they had been shaved off a thicker vegetable base.  However, the Spaghetti Bolognese with Mushrooms that came with the entree was good and hearty.  An average-size Cannoli tasted good but was rather ordinary, while a large slice of Chocolate Cheesecake that was not house made was excellent.  Service was good, and the ambiance in this very small eatery homey and comfortable.  But I doubt I will be back.There are just too many other better Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas valley to warrant a return.I recall this place being a lot better before. I have been there for dinner and from what I remember, the portions were large, ingredients fresh, and prices reasonable. A co worker and I were in the area and decided to try Chicago Joe's for lunch. The server was helpful and attentive, but he gave my co worker a glass with a huge crack down the middle. That could have ended very badly.The lunch specials are pricey for the amount of food that you get. We opted for a chicken parmigiana for $9.95. It consisted of a small scoop of cold pasta in an overly sweet pasta sauce, and a piece of breaded chicken no larger than the palm of my hand. The chicken also had gristle which was very gross. Overall the taste of the food was solid, the prices were too high for what you get, and the service was solid enough. I wouldn't rush back here again.

Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place, yet!I used to come here at least twice a week, back in 2003 when I used to live in Maricopa and in 2004 when I finally moved to Chandler.  Venezia's Pizzeria was nearby the Chandler-Gilbert Community College (cool academic institution, IMO) I attended at that time.  I remember grabbing a $1 side salad at McDonald's and then heading over to Venezia's for a slice of crispy thin-crust cheeze pizza w/ spinach... those were the days!  :)  I really thought I'd reviewed this place, but this could've been pre-Yelp and during my Citysearch phase...Finally had a reason to stop at Venezia's for dinner a little less than three weeks ago, so I decided I'd try a whole order of white pizza, no sauce.  While good on its own, this pizza came to life w/ many dashes of roasted red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan cheese.  The thin-crust didn't fare so well- it was soggy before you could say "cheese" (pardon the pun!), but I managed.  Too bad this pizzeria doesn't serve wine... I urgently felt the need to balance out the grease w/ a glass of wine, so my next stop was an Irish pub on Boston and Arizona...Venezia's delivers!  I mean that in every sense of the word.  We were out looking around the area one day and found this location.  Since we had just eaten we did not stop but I put it in my memory banks for future meals.  I checked their website and found that they delivered to my area.  Yay!  There is nothing like good pizza delivery after a long day. I have ordered delivery many times from this location and each time they appear at my door in the alloted timeframe with my fresh, hot pizza exactly the way I ordered it!  I have never called them but used their online ordering system and it works like a charm.  My requests have always been fulfilled.  The delivery drivers deliver with a smile and are always courteous. As for the pizza.....YUM!  It is a New York Style pizza with lots of cheese and great, fresh toppings.  They  have Sicilian style but I'm kinda stuck on NY.  :)  They also have a children's menu.  My daughter is a picky eater and, while she like plain cheese pizza her favorite is black olives.  I can order the mini cheese and have black olives put on it for her and that works much better then getting a portion of a larger pizza for her.  She is happy having her very own little pizza.  Their salads are always fresh and crisp.  I have not tried their wings yet but I'm sure I will.  They have some great specials too.  If you are near one of their locations within their delivery area give them a try!  I'm sure I will go to this location at some point but their delivery is so great, I'm not sure when that will be.  Thank you for delivering Venezia's!!!We live near so much good pizza that it's incredibly hard to choose now.  I had not eaten at Venezia's until almost 2 months ago, and we did the lunch special with a slice and a salad and a drink.  I forget the exact total, but it runs right around 6 bucks.  GREAT deal and GREAT pizza.Then, we've gotten delivery twice and I am so impressed with their website and online ordering system.  It's the best I've ever used.  You can customize the order, apply a coupon code, and pay online.  Both times we've ordered online we got our pizza in approximately 45 minutes.  And both times the driver was very friendly and had the cc receipt all ready for me to sign.  We've had the Meat Lovers, Pesto w/ artichokes & sausage, and the Hawaiian and enjoyed them all.  This pizza really reminds me of pizza I've had in NY.  The toppings are fresh and the crust is the right amount of yeasty chewiness.  Right now, Venezia's is my #1 choice for pizza.

Review Text :
King Tut's is both my scene and not my scene. Moving out here from New York, I was thrilled to find hookah places, and also one that was open late with floor seating in private booths and decent Egyptian food at good prices. The atmosphere is definitely a bit run-down in a good way, and the waiters are pretty on point, especially in dealing with such a huge crowd. But that crowd is the other thing. I was shocked to find that the hookah scene was primarily filled with frat boys and sorority girls. It still perplexes me how this crowd, many of whom seem completely uninterested in world culture, has made this place their home. Fine for them, but if you're not in that scene or an ASU student, be prepared to feel like you've just gone to Psi Delta Psi or whatever for their hookah-themed party where everyone knows everyone else.  King Tut's knows who their target audience is, and I always am annoyed when they turn off the loud Middle Eastern music for the latest hip-hop. It just makes it seem more like a frat party. I love a party vibe, but I also feel out of my element.

Review Text :
Burrito Express...how do I describe you? You're like a dive bar...that only serves Mexican food and no alcohol. You're not in the greatest part of town. You're located in a less than reputable shopping center. Your parking lot is treacherous (only one way in and out with minimal parking). But I'm not here to review your atmosphere. I'm here to review your awesome burrito! I stopped in one afternoon to grab something quick. I didn't expect that when I ordered my food that it would be THAT quick, however. From the time I made my choice to the time I sat down, I don't think five minutes elapsed. When my Chicken, Potato & Cheese burrito came out, it was piping hot! My particular burrito was on the spicy side...which is how I like it. Now, I know that the menu had the little "hey, idiot...this is spicy" symbol next to this burrito. However, I was caught a little off guard at how spicy it actually was. To put it mildly, it's been quite some time since I ate something spicy enough to give me the sniffles.The burrito was quite sizable, too. For comparative purposes, I'd say it falls right between a Chipotle burrito and one from Q'Doba. It was definitely very filling. Couple the size of the burrito with the massive amounts of shredded chicken and potatoes inside, and I was full for quite some time afterwards.Price wise, I think I ended up spending around $8.00 for the burrito and a "medium" drink that would make a camel think twice before drinking it. Couple that with the awesome red and green salsas they keep in the refrigerator, and you're set!If you're looking for quick Mexican food for a decent price (and  you're not overly-concerned with ambiance or location), then stop by Burrito Express. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner (combination plates), so you can come any time of day. If you don't want to stop by, they deliver, too!Normally I have been a fan of Burrito Express and order from them 5-6 times a year. My neighbor had food delivered to him yesterday and I was trying to relax in my home next door but found it impossible as there was a car with the bass so loud everything was vibrating. So I go out side and ask the guy nicely if he could turn the volume down when coming into the neighborhood. He is like, "oh, I can't do that as they are 1200 somethings he said...., ya da ya da ya! I'm thinking REALLY!!!! So I told him that was rude/disturbing coming into neighborhoods with it that loud. He could have cared less! So today I call to talk to the manager as there wasn't one there when I called yesterday afternoon. She picks up the phone and I told her what happened. She is like - ok, I will talk to him. No sorry for the disturbance, no asking who it was (because she knew). She sounded like she could care less also. I told her he should have turned it off when he got in the car to leave. She didn't care. Then I asked her what her name was - because I didn't want someone pretending to be a manager who wasn't. She refused to give it to me. She said this is a family business and I told her I know as I order from you, but how do I know you are the manager if you won't give me your name. She didn't care, didn't apologize, just had a snotty attitude. Then a couple minutes after hanging up my phone rings and it is them again - thinking oh she is gonna apologize for her unprofessionalism. Nope! I answer and same girls voice "Oops, got the wrong number" - are you kidding me, grow up. So I am done doing business with them and my neighbor who ordered wasn't happy about the situation either. Two rude employees who obviously don't care that much about customer service for their family business.I am placing Burrito Express just inside the 3 star camp.  A qualified 3 stars, 3 stars for the category...little Mexican joints.  Is that a category?  If it's not it should be.Anyway, just inside 3 stars.  Maybe 3.05433 or 3.06155.  Not as far as 3.14159 though.  Definitely not.  I had a burrito with potato, egg, cheese and ham.  It was big.  Not huge but pretty big.  I mean it didn't bludgeon me with it's girth or anything but it was pretty big.  It was good.  Not mind blowing good or anything but good.  Like I would have it again but I wouldn't drive far for it.  Like I would drive a few miles.  Probably only a few though.  Not a score of miles, that's for sure.  I would drive more than a couple but less than, say, 10 for one of their breakfast burritos.  Probably about 4 if I had to rate the burrito based on how far I would drive for it.  But there are other places closer to my office with good burritos.  So if I was somewhere, say within about 4 miles of Burrito Express and I was in the mood for a large but not too large breakfast burrito that was pretty good I would consider going to Burrito Express.  I'm not saying I would definitely go, like I'm not making a commitment by any means here, but I would think about it.  Probably.  Then again, I might not.  I might forget about Burrito Express, actually.What were we talking about?¡Su burrito de desayuno es muy bueno! I've been to Burrito Express a couple times, and on each occasion, I was drawn to have breakfast for dinner. The first time, I tried the regular ham and egg burrito. It's big with healthy amounts of egg, ham, and cheese throughout. The dish is served with a side of lettuce and the servers will bring out bottles of red and green sauce to top it all off. In the mood for even more? Step up your breakfast burrito game and get one with steak and eggs. It's what you'd expect and loaded with potatoes to boot. This one had me full and satisfied. My wife enjoys their bean and cheese burrito.The inside of the establishment is deceivingly spacious for the location. You can choose to hunker down at a table or booth, all within viewing distance of the big TV on the wall. I noticed that each time I went the TV channel was playing an international or uncommon American sport like women's boxing or volleyball. The outside of the restaurant even promotes English Premier League soccer, so that's pretty cool too.So, hey, whenever you're in the mood for some conveniently priced, quick and tasty Mexican food, give Burrito Express a try.¡Adios amigos!

Review Text :
I was totally creeped out by El Charro when I first went in there.  Super dark (like, you seriously cant see in there for about 5 minutes when you first walk in and are literally blinded by the AZ sun when you come back out), cold, and at the time SERIOUSLY smoky (but not anymore).  Its very small and cave-like, but dont let the weird ambiance deter you from trying this mexican joint.I always have the cheese tea, which is just a cheese quesadilla so I dont know why they have this odd name...  They also have the mexican cheese tea which is filled with cheese and beef.  Its lathered in butter so be prepared to hit the gym afterwards, but its worth it.  The burritos are good too, and surprisingly I hear they make an exceptional cheeseburger. Be forewarned, El Charro closes for three months in the summer, so call for open hours.

Review Text :
For a night on the town in Vegas, we opted for an off the strip Old Vegas style restaurant. My brother raved about this place and told us of the great food and Old Vegas charm. Our reservation was at 8pm and before we were seated we headed for the bar. The bar was a separate room and there was a piano and a lounge singer on the corner which reminded me of Frank Sinatra. He sang the classics: Fly me to the Moon, Luck Be a Lady...I was transported in another time, a glimpse of that Old Vegas that is now hard to find amongst the new glitz and glitter that Vegas has now become. The cocktails at the bar was served stiff but expect steep prices...my hubby's kettle and soda was $12 and my wine was $15. The servers, hostess and lounge singer all seemed like a character from an old movie...they were older, very proper, but with an Italian flair so much like those I would see in Sopranos, minus the gangster attitude.Our waiter who greeted us was very friendly and told us about the specials. He mesmerized my group with his explanation of the food. he had a great italian 'soprano" accent and a pompador hair which he kept in character the whole time. I ordered the Osso Bucco, a special of Pieros and a dish I have never had and most of my friends ordered veal. It seems veal is the way to go here, as the menu is full of veal. All I can say is everyone in our table ooh'd and aah'd over the food. My osso bucco was cooked for 4-6 hrs with the bone intact and my waiter stuck a little fork in the bone as I realized Im to eat the bone marrow! Cool I never had that before. The veal is tender, flavorful, and the bone marrow is unforgettable. My hubby's veal with quartered mushrooms, capers and wine butter sauce was also amazing. I couldn't help but be greedy as I ate from his plate too. This place is an experience in its own...receiving many accolades and culinary awards. its not the glitzy in-your-face-Vegas so don't expect a contemporary and ultra modern space. It is fine dining but it is unpretentious, has a dated feel with an old vegas charm. I loved the food here and I am planning to come back and have another chance at the menu.Love the old school Vegas vibe of this place.  It's like someone could get whacked at anytime here...in a good way!!Went with the house specialty, osso buco and loved every tender bit of it!  Too bad you can't order extra marrow on the side.  I feel guilty eating veal for about 30 seconds and get over it.  The cocktail lounge is awesome.  This would definitely be the place to get a martini.  Too bad for me I go looney after 3 and wanted to remember this meal.  They had a duet cranking out all the oldies which really took you back to a different time in Vegas.  Good stuff.  I'll still reserve Ferraro's as the best Italian place I've been to in LV but the ambiance and food really make this place one of a kind around here.Piero's is a solid go-to for traditional Italian in Vegas. I like that it's not a chain. It has an old-school feel inside with dark lighting and white tablecloths. The waiters are dressed to the nines and act very formal (in a good way). Here is what we ordered:-glasses of prosecco-proscuitto and melon-"garbage" (Piero's connotation, not mine) caesar salad (meaning it has alot of ingredients in it: avocado, shrimp, etc.)-house salad-fettucine alfredo-veal osso bucco (also comes with a side of fettucine noodles in the osso bucco sauce)Everything was delicious, especially the veal osso bucco. You definitely don't need a knife. Service was spot-on. I knock off one star because the fettucine alfredo, although delicious, comes in a distant second to the fettucine alfredo at Il Mulino in south Florida.I'm not a fan of Italian food, but I *AM* a fan of weird retro ambiance...which this place has in spades!! To me, it wasn't so much Rat-Pack-y as it was '80s Vegas -- more precisely, Golden-Girls-Go-To-Vegas: pastels on the wall, lots of beige, smell of Geritol in the air, old-school food and drink, Pia Zadora (!!!) playing in the lounge. FABULOUS! As mentioned, I don't care much for Italian food, but what I had here was excellent: prosciutto & melon appetizer, "garbage" Caesar salad and osso bucco. Bonus: this is one of the few spots I don't feel out of place ordering a Campari & soda, so I had two of those, as well! The prices are a bit steep, but just do as I did and have a fast-talking name-dropping deal-making TV producer/pornographer take you. Problem solved!To be honest, because of this place's pedigree, I was expecting a bit more mob shtick here. But rather than be disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised by the weird 80s grandma vibe. Let's be real, Rat Pack-era Vegas is played out anyway -- 80s Vegas is the new 60s Vegas!*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***I've been wanting to try Piero's for many years.  It's one of those places that have a lot of history with the city and some of its famous entertainers and residents.I was brought bread and iced tea soon after being seated.For the first course, there was no choice.  It was an agnolotti and cheese combination.  There were five agnolotti in a cream sauce and a triangle shaped piece of fried mozzarella.  The server ground parmesan onto the agnolotti to my liking.  This starter dish was very good.  When eating the fried mozzarella, I couldn't help but think of my students and their senior prom.  They always cleared the place out of mozzarella sticks.  The second course was a choice salads.  I chose the Caesar and the server did freshly ground pepper to my liking.  The romaine was as crisp as can be and the dressing was great!  A large salad course but I managed!For the third course, I had to go with the house specialty--Osso Buco.  It was amazing!  The meat gently came off the bone and the sauce in which the veal shank was braised was very good.  The server brought me a cocktail fork and stuck it in the bone to use as a marrow fork.  A straw would have been a good idea, too!  Along with the Osso Buco, there was a nice sized mound of fettuccine.  It had the brazing sauce poured over it.  Again, the server round parmesan over the dish.  I've had Osso Buco a few times before but it was never this good.  You can tell their process takes hours.  Service throughout the night was exemplary.  There must have been 10 people at least on duty and every one of them worked every table.  I was asked several times if I wanted a fresh iced tea.  When I finished my first glass, immediately a server appeared to take the glass to be refilled.  An empty pack of Sweet 'n Low was removed within moments of putting it on the table.  One of the servers who hadn't been at my table took my check and payment.  No waiting.  It's all for one and one for all.  Many of the Yelp reviews refer to this as old school.  I agree, and I think it's a great idea.  Seeing the servers with white jackets, watching the plates be pushed by my table on a rolling cart, having service that is outstanding--these may be characteristics of old school, and it's good that some places retain their old school ways.My only complaint with the place is the mandatory valet parking.  The lot isn't that big.  I can walk.  If some want to valet, let them.  A requirement--no, it shouldn't be!A Vegas classic...This place has been around for many years and even featured in one of my favorite movies ever, Casino! We came here for Valentine's Day per my man and I was hoping for the best as it wasn't exactly on my radar. We both left disappointed. To start off, an older lady who has probably been the host since it opened wasn't friendly and that's how the experience began. We arrived early and were seated near the kitchen however there were many other tables open including booths. Not cool. The room itself was a little odd. The low ceilings and outdated furniture wasn't pleasing to my eyes as I'm always into the decor. Odd space and it didn't feel like a classic Italian restaurant. We must have been served by 6 different people this evening which was a little odd however they were all very nice. Now let's get to the food -Started with a few cocktails, a lemon drop for me which was very smooth and a belvedere and ginger ale for my man which he enjoyed and had a few of them before the end of the evening. His second drink wasn't correct so we had to send it back. Crispy bread was brought over with very good butter. Next we ordered crispy cheese with house marina that was a little on the spicy side and this happened to be my favorite part of the meal. After that came a garbage Caesar salad that was traditional with a few extras like - avocado, shrimp and tomatoes. The salad was on the bland side, was hoping for a more flavorful dressing. Next came out entrees - osso bucco for him and penne alla vodka for myself. The osso bucco was fantastic loaded with flavor and bone marrow. We both enjoyed it very much. My penne was bland and boring. I make this dish better at home, was very disappointed. For dessert we had two large chocolate dipped strawberries that were super juicy and we thoroughly enjoyed them. The bill came and it was nearly $250. Not worth it. I've had cheaper meals that were much more memorable. At this price I expect at least one food orgasm and it never came :(I have long wanted to eat at this purveyor of classic Italian food with an "Old School" Las Vegas vibe and a longstanding reputation for memorable dining.  Now that I finally have, I am pleased to report that my high expectations were exceeded.  We had 6:00 p.m. reservations, and, when all Las Vegas Convention Center lots were full at 3:45 p.m., restaurant management was kind enough to permit us to park here without charge.  Normally it is valet parking only.When we returned from the Las Vegas Jewelry & Watch Show, Diane and I were quickly shown to our requested booth, and soon enjoyed a starter of cheesy and gooey Mozzarella Fritta with thin and spicy Marinara Sauce, along with exceptional crusty Italian bread and butter.  By the end of the meal, we (mostly me) had collectively consumed almost two entire loaves. A House Salad with fresh tomato, carrots, Green Bell Peppers, Red Onion, Iceberg Lettuce, and a light Italian Dressing was cool and refreshing, and a half Garbage Caesar Salad with Romaine Lettuce, tomato, a generous amount of avocado, croutons, Hearts of Palm, and large chunks of tasty shrimp was even more delectable.I wanted to sample the Verdure e Legumi in Brodo, so I requested a half order.  When the so-called cup of soup arrived, I was shocked to see that the white lion-headed crock containing the hot liquid would have qualified as a bowl almost everywhere else.  But not here!  After being on the lookout for a bowl, I finally found one being carried through the dining room by a server.  And it was a huge white ceramic tureen covered by a plate.  As good as the soup was, I was glad that I only had to face a half order.  Filled with cauliflower, spinach, carrot spears, celery, vermicilli, mushrooms, and a very tasty vegetable broth, the soup was simply great.The chef then surprised us by sending out from the kitchen complimentary Creamed Corn Au Gratin with Parmesan Cheese, which was sweet and creamy.  But nothing overshadowed my delicious signature dish entree of tender, falling off the bone Osso Bucco: a perfectly prepared slow-cooked veal shank mingling with a light tomatoey sauce and al dente fettuccine.  Meanwhile Diane greatly enjoyed her main of Veal Scaloppine Parmigiana topped by requested homemade Alfredo Sauce, and accompanied by splendid Roasted Potatoes.     A dessert tray then beckoned with several tantalizing treats.  But, since Diane is allergic to berries, we had to turn back a chosen Cream Puff when we saw that it contained pieces of strawberry inside.  With sincerely expressed apologies, a slice of Carrot Cake with Coconut-Flaked Cream Cheese Frosting was quickly presented as a suitable replacement, for which we were not charged even though I was quite willing and poised to pay for everything we ate.  There was no reason for any restaurant employee to know of Diane's allergy.Service from our highly competent waiter John Y. and his able assistants was on point all evening, with unbidden water refills, and requests for more bread and butter quickly accommodated.  Our booth was very comfortable, and, despite a bustling dining room, the ambiance was somewhat romantic with dimmed lights overhead.I will surely return for more fine Italian cuisine and hospitality.We had early evening reservations for a group of 4 on Tuesday of this week. We were seated at a table in the bar area where it's a bit noisy but convivial, especially the one chick grinding on her boyfriend's lap at the bar. Group orders cocktails, appetizers, salad, 4 entrees, a bottle of wine, dessert. Service and alcohol are wonderful; food mostly bland except for the veal chop parmesian, which was excellent. The service has been paced perfectly: no long waits between courses and no courses overlapping. Group has just finished dessert and has paid the bill -- a mere $600 -- and two of the group are slurping up the last of the wine. Older dude (I'd generally use the more respectful "gentleman" but it doesn't apply in this case) comes over and says, "It's time for you to leave. You've been here long enough." Group looks up and thinks he's being funny. Nope. Crabby dude says, "I'm serious. I'm the manager here and I need this table." Group looks around. There are two empty tables next to us. Most of us are fairly cosmopolitan and have eaten at swanky places all over the world, but never, repeat, never has anything so uncouth and rude happened to us in a supposedly classy but definitely expensive joint. We could certainly understand if the four of us had been loud and obnoxious or rude or cheap or spent an extra hour dawdling after we'd finished our meals. And even then we would have expected the manager to say something like, "Hey, I'm sorry but we need this table for a large group. What if you head over to the bar and I'll buy you a drink?" The woman who had treated us was not only livid, but embarrassed, and she dashed out of the restaurant. Two of us were slower and a different manager came up to apologize for the old man, saying that had happened a few times that week. What? We then made our way through the throngs of people waiting to be seated -- oh, sorry, there were only about 4 people standing in the lobby.So, a fun evening with friends was soured for no reason whatsoever. Plus I had to use up time which could be spent on better things writing this because I could never forgive myself if I didn't. For the record, the dishes I classified as bland were the mussels (puny mussels in broth not even interesting enough to dip bread in -- if you're into mussels, try the green mussels from New Zealand served at The Barrymore up the street), the shrimp appetizers, the garbage salad and the Osso Bucco, which was tender but didn't taste much different than mom's pot roast.

Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny.I'm listening to 2 Live Crew as I'm writing this so I'm feeling extraordinarily misogynistic. Forgive a brotha. There are two things you should know about this place, and it pretty much sums up my entire existence... Take a girl here on a lunch date. She will see you as sensitive and intuitive. You may want to use phrases like "I feel..." and "When Carrie gave her assistant that Louis Vuitton..."Order the Mushroom tart. Or is it tort? If you follow my advice, gentlemen, you'll have a great day. Good luck. And god speed.I've been to Arcadia Farms several times since my last review...Spotty service a few times, i admit, but I can't bring myself to take off a star since their food and iced tea are so fantastic!I went today for a baby shower and we had the back room for our group of 20+ ladies.  They gave us a limited menu so I couldn't order my usual (warm vegetable salad with chicken).  Instead, I decided to try something new... I went with the "wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart."  It was delicious!  The cheese was not overpowering and each bit had the perfect balance of the crust with caramelized leeks, spinach, mushroom and cheese... it was served with a mixed green salad on the side.  Yum!The AF staff did a great job with keeping our glasses filled with iced tea and lemonade and everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  AF continues to be a fave destination in my books!Gabi K and I happen to be "ladies who lunch."Arcadia Farms is THE perfect location for ladies who lunch, as it turns out...A perfectly made pitcher of iced tea, an heirloom tomato salad with mini mozzarella balls and sweetly poised basil. VERY good. Everything on the menu was quite tempting, including the desserts that greet you upon entering. EVIL tactics. For a moment in time, we were those lucky ladies. I just need more jewelry, and a better car. ;)Visit # 827 to Arcadia Farms...Since my last update over a year ago, I've literally been to Arcadia Farms way too many times to count (which is why I will estimate 827 total visits above).I've never once had a bad meal at Arcadia Farms... and I'm proud to say, I've ventured away from what my 'usual' order is on several occasions.  You really cannot go wrong at this place, but my favorite dishes are:*For appetizers: the brie cheese and the crab and avocado tower* For entrees: goat cheese tart, salmon, grilled vegetable salad, pesto shrimp salad, strawberry chicken salad, raspberry goat cheese salad, tuna sandwichAnd again, the apricot iced tea is my favorite in town!Despite how amazing their desserts look and sound, I always refrain from dessert because the meal is so filling!This is the perfect ladies lunch spot and although it's a bit pricey, it's so worth it for the fresh, healthy, and delicious food and the lovely ambience.  Keep up the great work, Arcadia Farms... I hope to be a loyal customer for years to come!Yes... I am writing yet another review for Arcadia Farms.  I've been in more times than I can count and aside form slow service once or twice, I've always been extremely pleased with the ambiance, service, food, quality, and overall experience.Whether it's lunch with a girlfriend or two, a business meeting, lunch with my family, out-of-town friends, and even baby and wedding showers... i love this place.  But can you believe it took me this long to go check out their breakfast?I was part of a business breakfast meeting at Arcadia Farms earlier this week.  We chose the venue because of the private dining room and it worked out perfectly.  Tiffany was our waitress and she was fabulous.  I had one too many cups of coffee so I was feeling great!  I also enjoyed fresh squeezed OJ and a delicious egg white asparagus scramble.  It came with potatoes and fresh fruit - I also had a side of whole wheat toast.  The other menu options looked fabulous also; whether you're in the mood for fruit, pancakes, yogurt, omelettes, french toast, smoked salmon, or the AF signature wild mushroom, spinach and leek quiche (which I bet is similar to their amazing wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart), there is something for everyone!Our business breakfast was wonderful not only because of the people that attended, but because of the experience we had at Arcadia Farms.  Now I can add Arcadia Farms to my breakfast rotation in addition to my lunch rotation!  See you there!What's a French cottage doing in the middle of Scottsdale? I don't know, but I adore it. I had lunch here with my lovely gal pals, along with scores of other ladies who lunch. Everything is so dainty and cute here, it might not be a dining destination of choice for most manly men. But no doubt that the guys who have eaten here will tell you that the food is pretty amazing.Farm-to-table food is dished up here, and there is not one thing on the menu that won't tantalize your taste buds. I had such a hard time deciding what to get, and after looking around at other tables and digging deep into my own cravings, I decided to order their Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes with goat cheese and basil beurre blanc. Wow, was this decadent! It's saucey, which I wasn't expecting, so it was a bit rich. But the combination of ingredients were delicious and I ate every last bite. The salads that my friends had looked fantastic as well, and portions were huge. I was also eying the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart and their signature strawberry chicken salad, but unfortunately, I'll have to wait for my next trip back to AZ to taste them. Of course, we had to make room for dessert. You must not skip their desserts! Again, everything sounded wonderful, but we went with a carrot baby cake and a coconut baby cake. Don't be misled - these cakes are not bite size. We had to take at least half of each home because they were so big. A beautiful setting for a lovely lunch, and if it's gorgeous out, try to snag one of their patio tables out back. It's places like these that make me wish I was a professional lady who lunches!um wowi was a bit nervous trying this place for lunch since everyone says it's so slow but we took a risk and we told our waitress we were on a lunch break. she was so awesome about it! we were in and out of there in an hour, with to-go iced teas to boot. seriously awesome! like, so awesome we went twice in a row. this is a frequenter.i had the roasted chicken with tomatoes, spinach and artichoke with a side salad. it was delicious. my friend had the mushroom and chicken crepes which she said were insane. and our other friend had the shrimp salad, also good. but from my eyes i would say my meal and the crepe meal looked the most delicious. i wish my backyard looked like their patio. im going to spend the rest of my afternoon pretending i'm still out there relaxing.I can't remember the last time I've had such a picturesque brunch. The patio at Arcadia Farms is absolutely beautiful, and it almost reminded me of the times I had brunch in Key West (which, trust me, is definitely a good thing.) Our group of six grabbed a round table on the patio under a huge tree, and it almost felt like we were brunching in a treehouse. In case you can't already tell, I really loved my experience here.The coffee was strong and much-appreciated after a long travel day the day before, and the iced tea had something fruity going on which was quite refreshing. The menu is pretty big and I was happy to see so many unique items. And can we just talk about the warm strawberry shortcake? I wanted to, but I decided to be "good" and go with something a little healthier.I ordered the mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese, and added tomato and spinach. I loved how fresh everything was and how generous they were with the vegetables! I subbed fruit for the potatoes but they gave me both (dammit.) I ended up being happy to have a few potatoes along with the great spread of fruit. It was a really healthy, happy & colorful way to start the day! Service was a bit slow but this isn't a place you go to for a quick meal. Visit, enjoy, and definitely score a seat on the patio.Awesome place. I hope to visit again sometime soon for that cake!I had a lovely Sunday lunch at Arcadia Farms Cafe with my husband and two friends, during a weekend visit to Phoenix. It was a charming little restaurant, with the feel of a rich old white lady's house--greenery and white picket fences outside, white furniture, white tablecloths, and gingham prints inside. The vibe was calm and relaxing in an upscale kind of way--like this would be a great place for a fancy tea party. I had a glass of red sangria with my lunch, and that felt right, too.The food was excellent--fresh, clean, farm-to-table kind of fare. We ordered some warm brie with caramelized apples to share, and this was a wonderful appetizer, the cheese baked soft and gooey, the apples the perfect sweetness, all served with crusty toasted baguette. I got the roasted salmon "super" salad for my lunch, and it was perfectly executed. The salmon was ideally moist and flaky, and it came over a bed of farro, kale, radicchio, red onion, chickpeas, and cherry tomato, with a tarragon dressing. I loved all the textures, and every element was inherently flavorful. I very rarely order salads for meals, but this was one I'd get again and again. My husband got a modified ham and cheese sandwich (the kitchen graciously made it more kid-friendly for my 32-year-old boy) with the potato salad on the side, which I ate with enthusiasm. It was a phenomenally good potato salad, with firm, fingerling potatoes in a flavorful dill dressing.Arcadia Farms is across the street from the Poisoned Pen bookstore, which is my destination whenever I come to Phoenix. I'm happy to have a go-to place for lunch in the area, and look forward to my next Arcadia Farms meal.

Review Text :
I infrequently go to Jack in the Box. Don't get me wrong; Jack in the Box makes great burgers, sandwiches and sides.But the only time I'll go to Jack's is in the wintertime, in which they featured the Pumpkin Pie Milkshake and Eggnog Milkshake. And I was craving for the Eggnog Milkshake after my dinner. Another piece of technology I don't see back home is the kiosk booth to place your order for your food. As a substitute of seeing the cashier, you input what you want and how you want your food(s) and/or drink(s) customized. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=MkeNe_5lsNK9CkM4mqZMKgAnd the large $2.99 seasonal milkshake is programmed in the machine. You can even request for extra whipped cream and extra maraschino cherry as one many options. I slide my Visa to pay for my treat and I get my receipt with the order number. My milkshake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=ymC0PFMYFXXeOjZgd5QH9wAfter a few minutes, the clerk yelled out my number and I finally got my milkshake. One sip of the thick seasonal milkshake, I was instantly in the holiday spirit.Ladies and Gentlemen: that is technology in Las Vegas!

Review Text :
Holy mother of god!!  What an outstanding meal THAT was!!!  Thanks to Susan R for hooking me up w/ the link for $50 off cuz I probably wouldn't have tried this place out if I didn't have it.  You could easily spend $100 by yourself.  The guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine, crab cakes, osso buco and the crepes for dessert.  He also inhaled the whole damn thing but that's another story....How can you possibly beat homemade pasta???  You can't.  We opted for the pasta sampler for the appetizer which consisted of gnocchi, ravioli and risotto. I've never had gnocchi so tender.My wife went with their version of frutti di mare which was amazing and I went with the squid ink pasta w/ clams.  Did I mention how good fresh pasta is???The waiter even brought us a couple small desserts on the house which consisted of a small tiramisu and cannoli which was really cool of them.I guess the only thing that would hold me back from coming back here would be the price.  I'd be interested to see how it is for lunch.  I know we'll go back again before the coupon expires.  This is definitely the best Italian I've had in Vegas.Was very excited to visit Ferraro's for the first time last night.  Although I've lived in Vegas for 17 years, I've never been to Ferraro's.A good friend was hosting a party there to celebrate the launch of his new company.  For hors d'oeuvre we were served slices of Cheese Pizza, Sausage Pizza, Risotto Balls, and Sausage w/Marinara Sauce.....all of them were awesome.Once we were seated, we were served Gnocchi w/Marinara Sauce & Penne Pasta with Bolognese Sauce for Appetizers.  For a Salad we were served a salad w/Heirloom Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar, Avocado, and Red Onion.....this was soooo good too!  For an Entree, I chose the Filet w/Wild Mushrooms in a Veal demi-glaze reduction while the Better Half chose the Fresh Seabass.....a couple of friends ordered Ferraro's World Famous Oso Buco......we loved them all!And to finish the dinner, we had Tiramisu & Cannolis....what!!!  I think I died and went to heaven!Plus the wine was free flowing all night long.....I can't remember how many glasses I put away.....ha!I hate to sound like such a Homer, but this was a really really good experience from beginning to end.Will I return?  F-U-H-G-E-T-T-A 'B-O-U-T I-T!Want a mouth orgasm? Ferraro's will give it to you, and give it to you good!Finally tried Ferraro's for lunch with my gal pal. Lunch special 11-4 $9.95!We started off with an Appetizer Arancini Tartufo, rizoto filled fried balls MMMMMMMMMMM YUMMY!I ordered the Salmon, very good, moist and delicious!My friend had the Chicken Vesuvio, must have been good she wiped her plate clean with her last piece of bread, lolOur meals came with a delicious house salad, scrumptious!Bread basket is a winner, comes with Olive Oil and garlic spread.They have sweetened Iced Tea! Yeah baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The service was fantastic!Peter was our Server and he rocked! He really is a kick ass server! They are lucky to have him!Will be back for sure!HAPPY HOUR...yes they have one! 4-7 and 10pm-2am in the lounge and bar!This is a great restaurant for a first date!I added a few photo's of our visit.It's all about the lunch specials here.  Fantastic spaghetti and meatballs with a salad lightly dressed in a yummy balsamic vinaigrette for only $10.  The pizza I had was good, not great.  I appreciate the different size pours of wine offered.  Other restaurants should follow suit.Excellent!  Love this place. My former "go-to" place was La Scala.  However if you want a special meal, try Ferraro's.a. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.b.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.c.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.d.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.e.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu. I love coming here and will continue as the food and service are great.Came here for restaurant week!Semi casual Italian restaurant, off the strip, that caters to locals!  Not sure if they offer the menu at 1/2 price for locals year round, but during our visit it was still going on!  That's EVERYTHING on the regular menu at half price for locals!We supplemented the RW menu with Calamari Fritti ($15 / $7.50 for locals): Fried calamari and Spicy Tomato Sauce. This was good, very tender pieces of squid. Lightly breaded with not much flavor/seasoning...almost plain!  Wish these was a bit more zing/kick in the flavor dept.The Complimentary bread...nothing crazy here, but the pesto/olive oil combo was nice.  I dipped the calamari in it to add flavor lol.Tasting of Agnolotti : Ravioli Filled with Spinach, Mascarpone, Ricotta, Mortadella, and Tear-Drop Tomato Sauce. Good, but wish there was more to the tasting lol.  They gave up one ravioli, so it was a pretty light portion.Tasting of Gnocchi Bolognese : House Made Potato Dumplings with Bologna Meat Sauce. This was perfect! The dumplings were super soft, tender and meat sauce was flavorful! This was the highlight of the night for me actually, and I would come back for this dish alone!  Gnocchi doesn't usually do too much for me, but this actually wow'd me!Mista del Casa: Mixed Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette. This was actually pretty good, coming from someone that doesn't enjoy eating salad lol. Simple but flavorful salad.Caprese di Bufala: Bufala Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil, Pine Nuts, Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil. I only tasted the Mozzarella, which was good. Not my kind of dish.For main entrees, Osso Buco ($45 or $22.50 for locals): The House Specialty, Veal Shank Braised in Red Wine Reduction and Faro. This was super tender, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth! Sauce was a good consistency, but a bit rich...couldn't finish it!  Tried the bone marrow...ok, but I guess I am not a huge marrow fan.Pollo Piccata: Chicken Breast, Capers, Lemon, Butter and White Wine. Good chicken, a bit heavy on the capers with a strong mustard taste, but good overall.And for dessert, a Tasting of Tiramisu and Cannoli. Tiramisu wasn't overly strong tasting, but good overall. Cannoli had a crisp shell and light filling...good! Service was very friendly, and our waiter even entertained Little Foodie Dude while he ate :PPrices would be great if you are local, and fair if you aren't...just not as much bang for your buck on certain dishes.  Go with the pasta since everything is made in house!  Give em a try :PPics :My bf had gotten a restaurant.com certificate a while back and we finally made a date to go and try out Ferraro's. I love going out to fancy dinners and splurging every so often so I was super excited. Basically, the ambiance and food were awesome, but the service was so blah that I just couldn't enjoy the restaurant much.We arrived right on time and were seated right away. Our server came over and my bf showed him the certificate, but he told us they had stopped taking them. We said we didn't know because restaurant.com usually informs you if that happens with a certificate you've purchased. We were not rude or upset with the server at all and in fact were totally nice about it. After that little exchange, he basically treated us like we didn't exist. We had checked in on Yelp and saw that there was an appetizer offer for checking in and didn't even feel comfortable bringing it up as he had seemed so annoyed about the restaurant.com certificate.I think this sums up everything he said to us that night: "Wine? (takes our order) Great." And then later, "Ready to order? (takes order) Great." And once we were done with our meals, "Dessert or are you done?" To which we replied, "we are super full, so ready for the check whenever." And that's it. When he dropped off the check after running our card, he didn't even say thank you for coming in or have a nice night or anything. Just dropped it off quickly on his way to another table. Needless to say, I don't even need to go into details about the food, but I will say that one of my fave places is Gaetano's in Henderson, which has a swanky romantic ambiance and the food is even better AND the service is TOP NOTCH. You always feel welcome and greeted warmly by the owners, unlike Ferraro's.I always know that if I ask for a recommendation for good Italian food from a cabby from MA (Hey, Mike!) that I won't be led astray. My mom and I were looking for some chow before we went to see Divas last Saturday and ended up at Ferraro's. It's in a strip mall, but do not let that fool you. I've only been to one other restaurant, ever, whose service rivaled theirs. Our very helpful and welcoming waiter, Eric, made our dinner such a treat! He also gave us really great tips on what to order, and I must say that although it was so out of the ordinary for me, I could not have been more pleased. BREAD. It needs to be in all caps because up until this meal I'd been forgoing all gluten....but when they sat the basket of warm focaccia and rolls in front of us with the tangy balsamic/oil dipping sauce I knew I was in trouble. There was no way I wasn't going to eat it and can I just say that I don't regret not one bite! The focaccia is buttery and crispy and chewy...all of my favorite things. The rolls were crunchy on the outside and perfectly airy and chewy on the inside. The oil & vinegar didn't last long. I almost licked the dish. I also ordered a side of their marinara since our main dish wasn't marinara based. So delicious....I can imagine the pasta dishes where that is used are out of this world.We started with the Beef Carpaccio. It is served with a bed of arugula and fresh Parmesan cheese atop and then Eric squeezed half of a lemon on top of the whole thing and rolled it up for us. I just don't even know how to explain to you how delicious this dish is. Simple, flavorful, and I didn't want it to end. While I was in the ladies' room, my mom ordered the grilled octopus salad. I can only imagine that Eric recommended the dish as my mom would never, ever order octopus on her own! I was a little worried until it was brought out and I got my first bite. It is served cold, diced up with other amazing things that I am blanking out on at the moment, but it was all perfect together. Interesting texture to get used to, but oh so very tasty. We shared the Pappardelle Mimmo which is long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, and truffle. So decadent but they also do such a great job of not overwhelming the dishes with any one flavor. This was a celebratory dinner and it couldn't have been more of a success. Eric took such good care of us along with the rest of the army of servers who made sure we never had an empty glass.There's not a lot to not heart about Ferraro's. There's not really a reason to read this review either since you can tell that everyone is telling you... GO! Pros:- Perfect for a date, no matter what age- Fancy pants enough to have a bathroom attendant?!- Clean!Cons:- Erm, like none? Service - 5/5. Staff was beyond wonderful. Just genuine, warm vibes through and through. People here to treat you with kindness because they're just good people, not ONLY because they're here to make some money. (Which is a great way to earn even more of my money, too.)Happy Hour Food- - Wine is 25% off! - House bread- 5/5 Ohhhhhhh you need this. One of the best I've ever had.- Beet salad- 5/5 Fabulous flavors! - Calamari- 3/5 pretty generic. Comes with a sweeter sauce.- Caesar salad- 4/5 pretty plating.

Navigating a menu steeped in heritage, many 'signatures' outlined while seasonal notes decorate a large collection of house-made pastas, it was with a basket of warm bread with oil atop caponata that the two-and-a-half hour meal began and with a bottle of white from the well-priced list soon poured for some a duo of sliced truffle alongside meatballs and polenta proved a decadent opening duo, both notably available as part of the 4-7pm happy hour in the lounge at a fraction of the a la carte price.Transitioning to Antipasti, the well sourced Affettati e Formaggio was presented as a veritable bargain at $18 with mortadella, prosciutto, and speck all shining alongside crumbly Pecorino and rich Gorgonzola, but acknowledging that none of these items are made on-site the true star was actually bowl of Mrs. Ferraro's sliced eggplant, an in-the-know sort of item served at the request of one diner that saw the oft-fried ingredient breathed new life through vinegar, sugar, and black pepper - each bite delicious on its own, but all the moreso when used taken as a poignant foil to the charcuterie's meaty sapor.Joking that an Italian Tasting Menu mostly means the chef will send out more pasta, round three featured a quartet of primi plated tasting-style by the kitchen plus a bowl of pasta created at the Sicilian Chef's whim, and although the risotto unfortunately came off a bit undercooked the four house-made noodles were undoubtedly amongst the best in the city, the signature Puttanesca not nearly as briny as one may guess from the ingredients while both gnocchi and agnolotti were tender bites of decadence, the artichoke pasta marrying discrepant flavors with brown butter a truly dynamic dish that hopefully represents a sign of evolution from a kitchen already well versed in the things it has long done well.Sticking entirely to signatures for secondi it would seem obvious that no meal at Ferraro's should end without the city's most storied Osso Buco, and carved tableside by Gino with no more than a fork and spoon the tender meat in rich wine was just as good as rumor would have it, a compliment no less applicable to juicy braised rabbit served alongside lemony wilted spinach or the best tripe dish I've encountered stateside in quite some time, each supple bite rife rife with texture while the spicy sauce served to highlight the offal's intrinsic flavor rather than hide it like so many others.Perhaps mistakenly allowing the kitchen to decide upon dessert it was with a rather mundane chocolate cake that the evening was originally set to end, but having heard rumor of a tiramisu not to be missed a slice was requested along with four spoons, the sizable $12 wedge every bit as textbook as the menu's other classics with a delicate balance of mascarpone and cinnamon overlying feather-light ladyfingers ever so faintly accented with coffee and a the slightest hint of liquor.Four of us got together to try several dishes at Ferraro's.  Shortly after being seated, we were brought drinks and we took awhile to peruse the menu to agree on the items we all wanted to try.  We were brought a bread basket with ciabatta and focaccia.  We then ordered the following:House made meatball with a fried stick of polenta and a rice ballImported Italian meats and cheesesSpicy eggplantRisotto with Italian arborio rice, tomato, ricotta cheese, black olive powderPesto gnocchiCapellini puttanescaArtichoke spaghetti with caviar and cinnamonHouse made ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, light tear-drop tomato sauceTripe in spicy tomato sauceOsso buco with farroFarm raised rabbit with sautéed spinachFlourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and strawberriestiramisuNoting we were sharing dishes, the house opted to serve our appetizers and initial four pastas on separate plates with a small serving of each.  The imported meat and cheese plate on the menu as affettati e formaggio was outstanding with a good selection of meats and cheeses.  Along with this, the off menu item, sliced eggplant was excellent.  We then moved to the pastas.  The risotto was not cooked enough and was chewy.  The pesto gnocchi and house made ravioli with spinach, ricotta, mascarpone, and mortadella were the standouts.  The puttanesca was also good.  A fifth pasta was brought, an interesting and very tasty spaghetti with artichoke, caviar, cinnamon, and brown butter.  I never expected cinnamon and pasta to be together but it worker very well with the butter and caviar.For the main course items, the peppery tripe and osso buco were excellent.  Their menu notes that the tripe is "awesome" which it is.We finished with two desserts--a flourless chocolate cake and chocolate mousse with strawberries.  This was OK but we ordered one more dessert--tiramisu.  It was excellent.  Soft in texture and not overrun with alcohol, this was a perfect ending, along with a double espresso over ice--to a very delightful two and a half hour dinner with good friends.Service was excellent during the meal.  The individual plating of some of our dishes made sharing easy but sometimes the food appeared lost on the very large plates.  During the second half of the meal, the servers opened the extenders on four sides of the round table so we had more room.

Owned by the same parent company as Old Country, and much of the same food, but just not as good (or should I say not as mediocre?)This location is close to my job and they give a 20% discount if i show my badge, so I end up here sometimes even though it's not so great.The food's ready to grab and eat, so that works well for lunch hour.The digs are showing their age and wear and tear, but most of the bussers seem to keep things tidied up (as they try to earn a tip from you, even though they don't even get you drinks anymore)Pretty much everything here used to be better a few years ago.  The last several visits I've encountered things like wilted spinach one visit only to have my complaint remedied by NO spinach on the next couple visits.  That's what i get for being picky i guess!Your lunch here will consist of such delicacies as cheese enchiladas, cheese pizza, macaroni & cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn bread, spaghetti, chicken dumplings, soup, jello, and an iceberg/romaine lettuce mix, and a few other things.  'tsabout it....day in and day out, with an occaisional 'teriyaki' chicken & white rice or grade-school-cafeteria-grade 'meat' patty on dried bun, or something like that thrown in to keep you on your toes.They used to offer both ice cream and yogurt in soft serve machines, but usually it's only one or neither.  Just like the main courses and sides, the dessert selection just isn't what it used to be.The creme brulee and prime rib must be held back until the weekend when they charge that $2 more.

Any place with a boisterous Bostonian as an owner and Red Sox memorabilia plastered on the walls automatically makes me a fan. The fact that their pizza is delicious makes me an even bigger fan. All these people who say the counter service is rude have obviously never been to Boston, and cannot appreciate the assholeic nature of its inhabitants. I mean, do you really think the people who are taking your order really give a shit about how you're doing? I don't. Anyway, I ordered 8 pizzas for the office the other day and tried 3 different kinds, yes I can slaughter an ungodly amount of pizza, and I don't care about the repercussions. Call me a fat kid if you want.. The crust is perfection. The cheese, oh god, the cheese is a mouthgasm, the toppings are all fresh and delicious and the slices are HUGE. They also sell em by the slice @ $3.25, but considering what I just said, its totally fair. They have a potato, bacon and cheese kind that I am dying to try, and since lunch is in an hour and its a 45 second walk away, I'm probably going to go satisfy my craving... and then some... My only complaint is that they don't deliver.. but other than that, its wicked pissah.much like my eriberto's review there are certain guidelines and codes of conduct that are associated with Slices; and while i am currently a little too lazy to make an in depth crack at it here's the jist:steps to properly enjoy pizza at slices1. drown yourself in alcohol;   slices is only tolerable if thoroughly drunk, otherwise thoughts like "i wonder how long these have been sitting out under those heat lamps for" or "why is my pizza cold" or "why does this taste strange" will pop into your head, ruining your meal.2. don't bring your girlfriend here;    not only will she think you're a cheap dicknose but she'll look down on you for your horrible taste, and as a cautionary tale there is usually a minimum of 3-5 complete bromosexual pseudo-alpha males here decked out in their matching affliction shirts and amped up on enough cheap domestic light beer/red bull/anabolic steroids to make Danny Bonaducci look normal, just in case you might not want your special lady friend oggled&harassed.3. avoid at all costs;   but if absolutely necessary to eat here- choose a meat free option.   my detractors will wish they'd heeded my words when they're crouched over the commode spewing up that bacteria infested pepperoni the next day.All in all, with the various pizza options in the area;-Otto's-Tessio's-Spinato's-La Bocca-Venezia'swhy would you eat this garbage?

I recently had drinks and food with friends here. The service was awful! It took over 40 minutes to get my 2nd drink. In addition, they forgot two food orders. When I spoke with the manager he offered to take the items off my bill. I told him I will pay for the items I got. I was so frustrated because I just wanted him to listen to my complaint and he only kept throwing out excuses.

Review Text :
Yay! I'm a fan.Thank you fellow yelpers for the spot on reviews of this place.Cheap,decent and friendly. Best downtown buffet? I'm on a mission to find out!Main Street Station, tucked away behind the Cal (California Casino) and right next to the Plaza, is one of the nicer casinos on or near Fremont Street in Downtown..  What I usually do is park my car at the Cal, get a good 4 hr validation and walk over to Main Street for the buffet via the skywalk to save time, money, and avoid the heat by walking outside...  Main Street has a parking lot but it's outdoors, so I prefer Cal's option much better...So...when I was younger I remember going to Circus Circus to have their super cheap buffet!  (for those of you near Vegas I'm sure you've been there and done that too!  Circus Circus was the bomb when we were kids and thought the buffet was great until we grew up and out of it)  Well, Main Street offers a buffet that has the price of Circus Circus, but the food is actually comparable to those on the strip.  Granted it's no Bellagio but food is probably as good as I say Harrah's, Monte Carlo, etc... so it's definitely no slouch when it comes to the quality.  Went during the weekend for Sunday Brunch and it cost us $10.99 with free flowing mimosa if requested!So what makes this place that good?  First, the decor...  For a downtown casino it's got a grand feel to the buffet as it has a really nice european setting...  A few statues here, 30 ft high ceiling with stained glasses and windows, I believe there may also be a fountain inside the buffet, etc... real nice touch!The buffet layout was very nice as well.. wide open, lots of seating, easy buffet lines to get your food as the line goes from right to left starting with salads and ends with desserts.Variety was also terrific as they had everything from salads, pizza, soup, 3 varieties of eggs, country fried steak, roast chicken, steam corn, omelette station, bbq ribs, enchiladas, nachos, orange chicken, bbq pork buns, lau lau pork, etc.... a wide variety which I couldn't name them all but selection is awesome for it's price....Here are the notables..... prime rib brisket was off the hook!  Meat looked dry yet when it gets into your mouth it literally falls apart... Roast chicken was moist like it just took a shower without much oil (which should be the case), lau lau pork has a terrific smokey flavor which I have not had in other Hawaiian places making it a very nice treat, and some chicken wing dishes (Asian) had the most juiciest chicken wings available!  Just overall a awesome meal when you are not thinking of paying $20+ on the strip as this is a great alternative.  They even have ice cream cones you can self serve and the vanilla ice cream was tasty yet not overly sweet.  A great end to a nice meal!Service provided were pretty superb as well.  Our drinks were consistently topped and plates were removed promptly so there were no complaints here.  So guarantee worth your $14 with tip!One fun side note.. after eating do make sure you visit the restroom at this place...(I'm thinking of washing your hands after the meal what were you thinking???)  But for the guys restroom do take a look at a piece of Berlin wall that is used to hold up the urinals.  It's sort of all to see a piece of history while you do your business....  Only in Vegas!Hmm. I don't really know how to review this place. We came this morning for the champagne brunch with a pretty large party. The line was pretty long, but it went quickly and they were able to seat us relatively fast considering the size of our party. There were many pros to this buffet. Once seated, our server quickly took our drink orders and we were able to go get our food. They have a pretty good variety of options and it's organized well. There seemed to be something for everything. The food was ok as well. Now, onto the con and it's one heck of a con. I unfortunately caught sight of a roach on the line, right on the waffle, biscuit and corned beef hash station and that obviously stopped my appetite in it's tracks. That's unforgivable in my book, I won't be back.A long time ago a certain Pineapple clad Yelper told me about this buffet. He insisted that I should try it the next time I'm in Vegas. I did and have been taking family and friends here since.So it's already cheap right? You can make it even cheaper by signing up for their player's card and getting the 2 for 1 deal.I've been here for their Champagne Brunch. Pretty standard selection but good enough to satisfy your morning cravings. The champagne is free flowing and you can always order a side of orange juice to make your own mimosa!Filipino tip: They have ox tail at the far end of the Asian section. My family loved it and said it tasted like "kare kare". And if you're familiar with that dish, might be worth giving a try. They also kept saying how the oxtail was worth the price of the buffet alone.Service was pretty good. The servers are on top of refilling drinks and taking plates away. So if you're looking for a cheap, no frills buffet outside the Strip, give this one a try.UNPREDICTABLE QUALITY =2.5 STARS What had been a rewarding relationship with the Garden Court Buffet (abbreviated GCB)  has become volatile and unpredictable. On its good days, GCB is a reasonably priced buffet serving decent (not great) food. Excluding themed buffet nights, $10.99 with a Boyd card is a sweet deal for a buffet in downtown Las Vegas that is walking distance to the Fremont Street Experience. A handful of my Fremont Street Experience adventures plus two visits to the IRS were anchored by dining experiences at GCB. Although the GCB selection has trailed behind many of the popular Las Vegas buffets, there was always a few delicacies to reward my taste buds. I have enjoyed their meat loaf, salmon, lasagna, rice pilaf, miso soup, and Asian foods station. A sweet dessert would top off the experience.   With any volatile relationship, the bad days pull you away. Yesterday was one of my few bad experiences here. And it is a shame because it was my day off and I just happened to have my mind set on topping off an afternoon in downtown at the GCB. This experience started off promising. By 5:30 pm, a line to the cashier had developed. Being proactive, management opened two cashier stations leading to a smooth transition to the host then table. From there, I might as well been as present as a utensil to the server. It took a while for him to acknowledge me. Finally he'd bring me my two glasses of Pepsi then pass over checking up on me afterwards. When I was on the buffet cues is when he'd clear off my table (small portions on my plate).  Near the end of the meal I'd give up on waiting around for him to ask me if I wanted coffee,  if he would of even done that. But forget about the service, I was disappointed with the food.    Supposedly this had been coined the Best Buffet in Vegas. I tend to disagree. I have dined here on and off for nearly a decade and no way this was the Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Today GCB is supposedly one of the top five buffets in Las Vegas according to their advertisement. No way! Right off the bat I could say that better buffets include Carnival, Red Rock, The Orleans, Boulder Station, and South Pointe. And if you add the higher priced buffets in the Bellagio category, GCB falls lower on the Las Vegas Buffet totem pole. On its good days it has been simply "good."    There are a few reasons why yesterday I was disappointed with the food. First off, sushi which is  currently my favorite buffet food was nonexistent. No sushi whatsoever. Boo! Then there was no peeled shrimp. Ditto for the meatloaf. The fish was unappealing. Celery spoiled the taste of the rice pilaf. Not much choices at the Asian foods station, which is my current second favorite buffet station. On a bright note there was miso soup. Disappointingly , the miso soup that I have relished in the past was now dull and a few degrees short of the warm temperature of how I prefer my soup. Regardless I'd fill up on miso soup. A complaint I have with their miso soup is that the soup cups are not much larger than the ones that you put cocktail sauce in when there are peeled shrimp. With my options running out, I'd place spaghetti on my nearly empty plate. If this is supposed to be the fifth best buffet in Las Vegas, how come they skimp over meatballs? Why did it taste like can pasta?  And why would I go back here in the foreseeable future?   My relationship with GCP has become volatile and unpredictable . The way I see it, you live once. If you live once, why settle for unpredictable experiences? It has come to the point that I will now separate from GCB for at least six months.Very solid buffet for the price! I have come here for normal dinner nights, prime rib dinner on Saturday as well as champagne brunch on the weekends. Price is great for a buffet and the selection is decent. Tucked away in Main Street Station, the buffet is directly next to the cashier. It's pretty hard to miss. Make sure you are a B-Connected player's club member to get a discounted price. My favorite is the champagne brunch. All you can drink champagne and all you can eat brunch food? Love love love. Like I said, the selection is decent, but other buffets on the Strip definitely have the upper hand here. That is the only downfall imo about this place.Located inside the Main Street Station Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas, I was curious to try this place out and I must say that this place left me quite impressed. In a very good way!I managed to get there in time for their dinner buffet. For only $14 each, myself and my foodie date got to enjoy quite the cuisine they had to offer. I had to start off immediately with a plate of spaghetti paired with a garlic bread slice and chicken wings. For beverages, I had their pink lemonade which was not too sweet but just right! For my second helping, I had their chicken taquitos, dirty rice and a taco I made out of ground beef. Very good in taste! Since I was trying to not get too stuffed, I had to opt for dessert, which to my surprise, they had one of my all time favorite desserts- key lime pie! Had to grab a slice!Inside it is very roomy with a very lovely décor. It would kind of remind you of the décor that you would expect to find in a restaurant off the Strip. Since we arrived a few minutes early for dinner, there was already a long line. If you are a card member, your meal will run for less, maybe a dollar or two cheaper. They also have a very well known seafood buffet, which we did not have time to check out. Servers were very attentive to filling my beverages. I overall had such a great time here and my experience was very pleasant. Just come prepared with your fat pants, as you will be feeling very full with quite the variety of eats. From pizza to fried yams to spaghetti to salads to pork chops and fresh fruit, they got it all. Already become one of my favorite buffets when I decide to come visit Downtown Las Vegas next time!Came here for dinner. I'm not used to eating buffets anymore. I normally snack throughout the day. Been feeling more dehydrated than normal cause of the heat. I ended up drinking more than eating. The trick is to eat first and then drink if you eat at a buffet. I remember coming here way before I started Yelping with my now mother in law. This place is descent and offers a wide variety of food including pizza for the most pickiest eaters like my daughter. I thought I could handle more food but I only had one plate that consists of fried chicken, corn on the cob, grilled fish, sausage and rice. Rice was mushy. Blah. Chicken was good. A little dry but the skin was crunchy. Fish and sausage was good. The fish had a mild flavor. Sausage was flavorful. I had to save room for dessert. I had a chocolate cream pie which was sugar free but I also grabbed a couple of smaller desserts. One was a strawberry rolled cake with coconut on top and a chocolate fudge with a very rich frosting. It was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. Too sweet! Service was great. The waiter refilled our drinks and cleared our table once he saw the empty plates. I really like how attentive he was! The place was very spacious and had plenty of room to move around and grab food as you walk back to your table. It was an okay dining experience.

Once upon a time I was a young lad with a powerful hunger for life and meat. I used to love going to Chuy's. Tri tip sammiches FTW I would have pronounced had FTW not still carried the Tupac meaning back when I liked it...yeah the good ol days. How the mighty have fallen.After a trip to Ikea that went a bit too late to get my lingonberry fix, my companion and I were famished. One of the first places my navigation brought up in the area was  Chuy's. Hey right on, my generation digs nostalgia. The folks working were nice enough...I love the idea of serve yourself all you can eat chips and salsa, I forgot they have a bar, hey things are looking good....until.I don't know if the stale chips just put me off enough to realize that Chuy's looks like my ex's parents bedroom after they refinanced their house to take out an equity loan in order to make their bedroom look like a Margaritaville restaurant. Parrot Heads. They did a half-assed job and so did Chuy's. It lacks the charm I remember the old Metro Center location having.The chips were stale, the salsa was lame, the tri-tip was dry. The service was ok but apparently Wednesday night is the night to visit your buddy who works at Chuy's and get your drink on..I dunno maybe it's just short of payday and you couldn't afford your meds so this seemed like a good idea at the time. Point being I had to (got to?) listen to a loud conversation about a guy's terrible luck. He got pulled over speeding while hauling a trailer that he knew had no lights and got ticketed for everything he was doing wrong, Next day his wife got mad at him and busted a window in their house, later she burned his trailer down, ater again while "partying" he accidently hit the panic button on his friends house alarm causing the police to come to their rescue only to find 3 men with a pile of coke, entertaining a hooker. you aren't unlucky bro, you have bad judgement and worse taste in women.Sigh. If you dragged me to Chuy's I would go I guess...maybe...for childhood Nathan's sake.

Review Text :
Our first visit to Remington's was on a recent weeknight.  We made reservations but they certainly were not needed as the dining room was nearly empty.  By contrast the bar lounge area was rather busy.  A piano and lounge singer could be heard into the dining room, kind of a nice background that we did enjoy.  Others have raved about this being a classy place.  I sure didn't get that vibe.  It was more 80's dated hotel restaurant than classy to me.We had a very attentive waiter who served us well.  There seemed to be a lot of servers with a lot of busy acitivty, constantly in and out of swinging doors.  There was a large group in a private closed off dining area.  We noticed most patrons were in their Senior years.  Maybe they alternate between here and Charleston's?Between us we ordered steak & grilled salmon with a potato dish to share and a couple of side salads.  The steak was not cooked as requested but we didn't bother to send it back.  Salmon was unremarkable.  The tomato mozzarella salad was abundant but yellow tomatoes were inedible mush and the red tomatoes were just flavorless.  Lyonnaise potatoes were a tad greasy.  Dinners are all ala carte.  Nothing was particularly bad, just nothing to get excited about.  I felt like I was dining in a hotel restaurant, food was delivered with plastic covers like they use in room service dining.  Overall I have to say I was simply underwhelmed.  After reading other reviews I had greater expectations for Remington's.  At a total of $84 (no alcohol) we expected more.  If I were a hotel guest on an expense account, maybe I would have felt differently. For the money, next time I would drive just down the street and go to Ruth's Chris.  We won't be hurrying back to Remington's.If you've got the time, then Remington's is the place.  I made reservations on line for a Wed. night at 7, and they even called to confirm but when we showed up they had no clue who we were.  The maitre de said 'no problem, give me a minute' and then disappeared.  We were left standing for 10 minutes before a hostess came to seat us.  We assumed they were clearing a table and were surprised when we were led into an almost empty dining room.  We were seated and although someone brought us water almost immediately, it was another 10 minutes before our server showed up and asked if we wanted menus!  NO let me guess what you have!  A few minutes later, she came back with the menus and left us alone again.  Assuming this was how the evening was going to go, we decided to skip any appetizers and just order, eat & get out as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, Remington's must have liked our company because it seems they wanted to keep us there for as long as possible.  Our salads arrived promptly at 8 (1 hour after being seated).  Shortly after, someone dropped off a basket of dinner rolls -  butter would have been a nice touch.  We finished our salads and sat waiting for our entrees.  And sat and waited and sat and waited.  At 8:30 our entrees were finally delivered.  We ate our meals and as she was clearing our plates we asked for the check so we could make our exit.  And again we waited.  The time stamp on our receipt shows she rang us up a little after 9 but it was almost 9:30 before we allowed to sign the bill & get out. The one redeeming factor of Remington's is the food.  I had the tomato/onion salad and pork chop while my g/f had the baby spinach salad and shrimp.  All were wonderful and certainly worth the price on the menu, but not worth the time.After looking at the menu and having a groupon burning in my pocket I was pretty excited to try out Remington's Restaurant.  Unfortunately that's as far as the excitement went as far as dining experience went. Pro's:LocationCon's:Fly landing on bread bowlHost's dressed like morgue workersFood comes out with plastic dome's over it to keep warm but really wasn't too warm anywaysFelt very dated inside Server pointed out total before groupon like I was going to stiff him on tip Overall I will not be back and wasn't impressed at all.  I guess if you are staying at the resort it's not a bad choice but I'd still go for a quick drive to one of the many other fine establishments within a short distance.

I went to lunch with my buddy, Rob M., to a place called Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill. It was actually pretty cool! I was surprised because it is in one of the more LAME areas near my house. Namely "Warner and Cooper".When we entered however, it was anything BUT lame. Dog bowls on all the tables filled with mutant peanuts. Granted, it was lunch, but there really wasn't more than 3 other groups there. This led me to believe the food/service was bad. Not at all! This place rocked!We shared some nachos in a heterosexual kinda way, and shared manly stories about football before shoving off. By the way, Rob, you owe me $15.00!!!

What the...I was super impressed by this Subway. I tend to reserve four and five stars for places that really exceed my expectations. And fortunately, because I am addicted to Yelp, I find only the best of the best. But what brought my to Subway was the need to feed. On a hot AZ day I was driving around running errands with friends when suddenly I just had to have some lunch. My friend spotted this Subway and while I first thought that finding another option might be better, I didn't see the point in disagreeing. We walked in and were immediately greeted by three smiling employees eager to take our orders. We wanted the same sandwich, split, so they offered to make two sandwiches but give us the low low price of 1 footlong instead of 2 6 inches. This saved us two bucks!The "sandwich artists" were super funny and it was clear that they had been working here a while. They had a good time slapping the ingredients together and really piling on the toppings. I don't live in the area but if I lived closer, I'd come here just for the service. I left here with a smile on my face and a pretty decent sandwich to boot.

Have I ever shared my issues with microwaves before? I know I am a creep but I really dislike microwaved food. I almost had a meltdown when my expensive green chile burro was placed in the microwave. It was $11 and it's not even fresh? Is it cold? I watched you scoop it onto the tortilla, it wasn't from the fridge and if it wasn't hot to serve......does that mean it was at the perfect temperature for food born bacteria?  Also, don't you know microwaves make tortillas all funky and weird textured? While it was microwaving I was able to check out the dried, crusty filth on all of the appliances: evidence of cooking and not cleaning. Yuck.  I really need to stop looking at stuff like that. Luckily, I was able to talk myself out of being a total nut job and I ate it. I was only able to eat  some of it because 1. it was effing huge and 2. the image of the crusty splatter kept popping into my head. regardless, It was so tasty. My favorite green chile burro used  to be from Espos but I have other issues with Espos.  This burro compares and while not totally clean and it being overpriced... and the fact that they microwaved it....it was really really really good. like good enough for me to give this place 3 stars. I like my green chile burros made with shredded beef, none of that weird cubed meat for me,  and they deliver on that aspect!i honestly don't know if i'm capable of going again, but if you're more hardcore than i am and you are down with the get down, the i say munch up!Looking for quick, moderately priced Mexican in Old Town?El Molino is your answer...It's nothing fancy but it hits the spot.  I've had chips and salsa, guac, a chicken taco salad, and most recently a bean and cheese burro... I hear the breakfast burritos are pretty delicious as well so I may be back soon for some am fuel or to cure a hangover.Either way, El Molino is a step up from fast food but it's no frills.  Oh, and the people in the Yelp office are huge fans... they are the ones that turned me on to it.  (Gracias amigos!)

Review Text :
Metro pizza is a Las Vegas locals pizza place. It's NOT cheap but they are pretty consistent.Most recently we had a lunch caterered in at work and everything was quite good.The delivery & setup man was fantastic he made sure we had everything and extra.We ordered the salad, garlic knots, baked ziti and chicken parmesan. The food was hot,cheesy and the chicken had crunch. I couldn't find myself shelling out $40 for pizza & breadsticks but it was a nice treat.For starters, the complimentary fresh baked sourdough loaf bread and butter basket is a nice treat!Mmmmmm yummy I love Metro Pizza. The Decatur and Flamingo location is cozy and fun always a nice experience!The Service is Fantastic every time I have dined here and I am unsure why I am now just submitting my review for this Awesome pizza and Pasta place?Mmmmm yum what we ordered this time around was a Sicilian sub, spicy shrimp pasta and baked ziti.The jam packed Sicilian sub was great and set on home hearth baked bread it just melts in your mouth!The baked ziti loaded up with sauce, mozzarella and ricotta cheese it was the best!The portions are very generous as you are guaranteed to be leaving with leftovers for another meal!I have always had their pizza in the past which is very good however this is the first time I ordered a pasta dinner and am so happy I did!!!The Spicy shrimp pasta was divine, the sauce spicy and so flavorful the perfect mix of goodness! The big shrimp mixed in as well was very good and all tied in with angel hair pasta. Soooo good and my boyfriend loved it as well because we shared both of our dishes.We even saved $12 bucks off of our meal with an Entertainment book buy one dinner entree get one free. That is insane considering what the portion of the pasta dinners are!The service is always Stellar!!!See posted pics! Enjoy!Do you have any idea how good the pizza is here?On a scale of 1-10, it is a 9.5.  I am only holding out because we have a Tony's Little Italy Pizza in Placentia, Ca. that ranks a 10 in my book.We have been coming here for years, whenever we find ourselves in Las Vegas.  I think this may be the original location.  There is a decent amount of seating, not really huge, and bright, cheerful, NY ambiance.We usually order the extra thick crust, but we were trying to cut down our carbs this time around, so went with a thin crust.  I loved it's thin "crustiness"  with cornmeal base, and would definitely do it again.But....our real downfall was the fresh out of the oven, hot Italian bread with sesame seeds.  Fabulous tasting, it has a crumbly crust and the most tender insides you can imagine. They brought out a soup bowl of their amazing marinara sauce (I ended up drinking it like soup when everyone else was done) for dipping, and lots of butter.  I think I like the less acidic marinara even better than the pizza sauce.  Either way, you will be tripping over your feet trying to come back just for that.The good Italian sausage with fennel seed, cheese, pepperoni, and fresh mushroom is our standard order.  It never disappoints.  A large size gives you 8 large slices.They kept the Coke coming, and it was free with a Yelp check-in.  Even refilled our marinara bowl.  Such piggies we were.  No leftovers. We walked away full and happy, 4 of us for ~ $30 including one generous glass of house red wine for Mr. B. Happy to share this with you!Items Selected:Warm Housemade Bread and ButterMeatball Sliders and Garlic Romano Fries - Housemade Meatballs, Melted Provolone, Soft Garlic Knots with Marinara SauceFried Metro Calzone - Pizza Dough, Ricotta, Mozzarella, Romano Cheese, SpicesThe Cicero Stuffed Pizza - Meatballs, Ricotta, MozzarellaCannoli, Carrot Cake, Red Velvet Cheesecake, and Chocolate Fudge Layer CakeTold of a fried calzone that can be special requested whenever owner John Arena is present at any of the Metro Pizza locations, and perhaps occasionally even when he is not, it was on the invitation of the pizza-guru himself that my family stopped by the spot on Decatur for a lunch featuring the crispy golden pockets, a few additional items again proving the high quality of the local chain's wares.Decked out with a Mid-80's Miami Vice sort of vibe, the retro décor apparently demanded by locals who rebelled when an attempt was made to change up the style, it was with greetings from John as well as friendly servers that our group of five was seated in a large round booth in back, more stories of Italy and Metro's New York roots helping to pass time before the start of a true feast; the well-seasoned fries a bit less crisp that would have been ideal, or perhaps simply just less memorable than a quintet of delicious meatballs atop soft garlic knots and the restaurant's complimentary housemade bread.Ordering a stuffed pizza but told that the customized calzones would indeed arrive first, it was admittedly a bit shocking when three of the folded-pies landed at the center of our table, each large enough to feed two-to-three adults all on its lonesome with a crunchy shell giving way to a molten cheese center, the flavor of ricotta particularly prominent even when dunked in a sidecar of meat sauce with each bite far lighter than one ever would have guessed.Requesting one of the trio be packed to go, a reheated calzone reportedly proving more than palatable per a reliable friend, it was next to The Cicero that eyes were turned and as much as a pasta-filled iteration was a fun bit of novelty just a few weeks prior the meatball and ricotta-stuffed double-crust was even more decadent, the execution impressing not just those of us calling Las Vegas and Ohio home but also those visiting  from the Windy City land of Giordano's.Missing out on Metro's desserts during the seminar on Sky Pointe, and almost too full under these circumstances to indulge once again, it was at John's insistence that a platter of pastry arrived last, the crisp cannoli rivaling some of Sin City's best while both the chocolate and carrot cake were as elegant as those served full-fledged bakeries, the cheesecake simply too at this point to be enjoyed past more than a bite.A bit dated on first glimpse, the explanation from John helping to explain décor that dates to my childhood, Metro on Decatur may not be as 'fancy' as the one up North, but with food just as good it seems John's formula remains in skilled hands even outside the Flagship, future visits to other locations soon to come.Previous visits I had sliders and salads, but lately I've been eating from the pizza portion of the menu exclusively. The rumors and ratings are right: this place has fantastic pizza. Multiple crusts to choose from, several specialty options, but almost everything I've tried has been great.The Modesto is my favorite: roasted mushrooms, garlic, and roma tomatoes, with fresh basil. And you can add sausage for FREE. Who has ever heard of that?! So props for having legit vegetarian options, and for kicking them up another level with the carnivore customization option. The small is perfect for two, add on some wings or a salad and you won't do too much damage to your diet.The stuffed pizzas are also a hit- I'm not a fan of carbs on carbs on carbs, but BF would consider selling one of his kidneys for a large Loop (sausage, pepperoni, roasted mushrooms). The marinara dipping sauce is robust and comforting, but the crust is a bit too thick for my personal liking. I will say that the large, 8 slices for $30, is a great deal if you have a large group: similar, smaller, thinner slices in town go for $5/each elsewhere, and this averages out to under $4/slice with much better quality and a larger portion.And service. It's always great. Phoning in my order is easy, it's always ready on time at pickup, and staff are friendly when I pop in. Bonus points for having the two takeout-pickup spaces in the parking lot!2 for 1 Whole Pizzas on Sundays and 2 for 1 Slices or Whole Pizzas on Thursdays. This location only. No player card needed. Open everyday from 11 am to 12 midnight!Located inside the Ellis Island Casino off of Flamingo and Paradise, this find of a gem is a must especially on those days! For those that are not familiar with Metro Pizza, these guys are consistently in the top 5 of the Best of Las Vegas. For you first timers I suggest the Gotham, which has a little bit of everything. If not that, then the Honululu, which has ham, pineapple, green onions, and bacon bits!They not only have pizza, but their Garlic Romano Fries will definitely keep the vampires away from you! Or that one obnoxious person you don't wanna talk to! They have other locations as well but why would you not go here on those two days listed? You not only save money, but you get 2 awesome pizzas guaranteed!The only downfall I think is that on those particular days, they are very busy. They do have booths with tables but they are usually taken. My suggestion would be to call for pick up. When you get there, if there are tables available, by all means, grab them! If not, then you can always go somewhere else to eat.Lastly, don't forget to get an Ellis Island player's card because you just might score a free slice!

Restaurant name  Oregano's Pizza Bistro

Review Text :
Don't tell anyone back East that I had a Chicago-style pizza last night!  I'll lose a pinky or end up buried in the Meadowlands.What I like about Oregano's is the freshness.  We ordered the deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza and they warned us that it would take 45 minutes.  Hey, fine with me.  So, to bide the time, we got cheesy bread.  This thing was about 2 feet long!  It came out in a bread basket, but was hanging over the ends.  That's how long it was.  Hey, I'm single.  I pay attention to length.There are a million different ingredients you can put on your pizza.  We had mushrooms (you can choose regular or portabella), onions (white, carmelized or red), green peppers and jalapenos.  It came out loaded with cheese and topped with sauce.  I like that.  It made the veggies and cheese all melted together and then topped with sauce.  I could only have one piece.  I didn't stay for the pazookie.  One of these days, I will.  The service was excellent.  We had a table outside (it had stopped raining) near the heaters.  The manager even gave me a blankie to put on my lap.There is a great amount of effort that goes into eating at this particular Oregano's. First of all, arriving between the times of 430-6ish means you will be arriving near the time where there is limited parking space. I'm not sure how many people Oregano's seats, but it's 3x the amount of parking spots available. Secondly, the wait time can be killer. They do not accept reservations so you can easily wait up to 45 minutes during a non-weekend dinner rush. It's up to you to bring a powerbar or a TIME magazine, luckily I live 1 block away so I can come by, write my name down and go back home to watch LEBRON JAMES manhandle Paul Pierce. Or you can wait around and hope they bring you out pizza samples while you wait, which they commonly do.I did take my dad to this restaurant for his birthday. When we were all seated...my mom changed her mind and decided she did not like her seat...."uhhh, excuse me waitress, my mom really doesn't like this seat...can we please move?" Even though it was busy and crowded, no hesitancy, we got moved immediately. Definitely some solid service points with the staff. Despite the wait, the customer service here is impeccable, makes the wait time extremely tolerable.So we built our own Stuffed Crust 12 inch pizza with mushrooms, chicken and jalapenos....which takes 45 minutes to make. 45 MINUTES! So, yeah that sounds like a long time and it is. But good food is not fast food, do not forget this. While we waited we ordered the large Big Beefstroni Salad, which came anchored down with a mix of shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, white cheese, tomatoes, spinach, Romaine lettuce and crispy sauteed sweet onions on top. And it comes with some bomb dressing (not ranch). Definitely enough to feed 3-4 people. Once we finished that up, our pizza was knocking down our stomachs. This was a massively deep pizza with cheese and sauce and toppings for days. The menus says that it's big enough to feed 4-6 people. Sometimes when I read that, I think to myself that's a lie. But not this time my hungry friends. 4-6 people actually means 4-6 people. Oregano's, you have great dinners but you make me feel like a wood-legged pirate running a marathon...it takes me so long to finish with you, but alas your food is good and the amount of homeless people surrounding your establishment is amazingly 0....which is difficult to accomplish when you are so near to Mill Ave. So for this I thank you.I do wish parking was better, I do wish that there was more variety on your menu and I do wish that your seating was more comfortable. I'm 6 ft 3 and when I sit in one of your booths, the table is nearly on level with my head. I feel like a child who needs a booster seat.If I were ever to be grossly obese and it were due to the fact that I stuffed myself with Oregano's on a daily basis, I think I'd be willing to set my vanity aside and be quite content with that fact. Needless to say, this is not a place to go while you are on a diet. This is the place to go when you want a good ol' fashioned carb overload Italian style. I consume more carbs in one meal here than I do in a month of eating at home. And I love every gluten filled bite of it. Notable items: Cheesy bread - two foot long loaf of soft wonderful white bread slathered in garlic butter with oodles of melty cheddar cheese blend. GAWD. This is my favorite thing on the menu. I don't even try to pretend I'm not a gluttonous pig when it comes to this stuff and I always help myself to the last piece. Wings- BIG FAT drumsticks. All of them. Honey hot is delish along with the buffalo. Caesar salad - holy crap their salads are huge. They have three sizes. The full (or whatever they call it) is big enough for four or five people to eat from if it isn't the main dish. Bollo Pasta - with meatballs - Angel hair pasta and marinara with two huge meatballs, oh and the pasta is never ending. I have yet to see anyone get more than halfway through the first round though. *note angel hair being so thin sometimes the pasta has come out mushy(overcooked), all I've had to do was mention it and the problem was remedied in a very timely manner usually followed up by a manager visit, they don't mess around with customer service. Pizookie - Obvi. No, it isn't the best Italian I've EVER had but it is solid and consistent and really hits the spot when you want your fix. And the pricing is awesome. Lisa E, Nydia A and I binged at the one on Shea a couple of months ago, had the cheesy bread, wings and pizookie and our bill was $20. We sat there staring at the bill and each other dumbfounded for a couple of minutes. If you don't like this place, all I have to say is "Wanna PIZZA me?!" ;)

Review Text :
One senses a unique bend of lighthearted swank and artsy irreverence when entering Cowboy Ciao. The mixture of these two elements is a dicey proposition that's fraught with peril, but management has successfully done it...and  created an ambiance that mixes soft and hip music, subdued and sultry lighting, and break-the-rules decor while still coming off as elegant funk rather than young punk angst.Myself and my sidekick got here during prime time on a Friday night when the estimated table-wait was hovering right around the 40 minute mark.  Rather than hole-up for a table, we opted for zero-wait seating at the bar.  The waiters were great....both informative and talkative folks that made you feel comfortable with a genuinely friendly air about them that eschewed excessive fawning in favor of a down-home demeanor laced with neighborly charm.Grub-wise, everything we had was fantastic.  We started out with a Ciabatta appetizer served with both green and kalamata olive puree.  Next up, the famous "Chopped Stetson Salad", an indescribably unique and wonderful taste that's often known to upstage the main course.  They bring it to you with six different ingredients set in rows and explain what each ingredient is. Next, their server mixes it up in front of you with a special dressing.  It's savory taste and simple recipe has presented experienced cooks with something of an inexplicable magic trick.  From what I gather, many have tried to duplicate the taste, texture, and nuances of this deceptively simple dish, and lack of success has created vexing puzzle that's become the local culinary equivalent of Fermat's Enigma or the Four Color Problem. My date opted for Pistachio-crusted salmon.  I went light and ordered the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Both dishes were fantastic.  Icing on the cake came in the form of my favorite beer on the planet....Anchor Steam on tap.  My only gripe?  My dish should have come with bread to soak up the excess Mushroom sauce.  We asked if we could get some, and the only option provided was to order another ciabatta appetizer.  C'mon people...bread is cheap!  My date and her raging sweet tooth opted for desert....I had another beer.  She satiated her sugary cravings with something called a "zinger" that looked like raspberry infused cheesecake, and sang it's praises while relishing every morsel of it.Welcoming ambiance and staff.  Great menu and fantastic, creative dishes.  There's no TV visible anywhere, but the staff will update you on the D-backs or Suns games if you ask. Downtown Scottsdale is chock-full of incredible shops, and the surrounding area makes for a nice post-meal stroll. All in all, it's a truly unique dining experience that's taken the artistic ethos of it's surrounding area and successfully applied it to Southwestern Cuisine.  If you're in the area and looking to chow down in a manner that'll give you something to tell the folks back home about,  then by all means stop by, sit down, and check it out.By the time I ate here, I was totally cynical of all Scottsdale restaurants and was really thinking about having my lunch at In-N-Out.  I got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!So, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  Anyway, this place has "Republic of Tea" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!Next comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.Anyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.One of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!This is a tough review to write.  The location was great and I'm sure the dinner would've been good too based on the other reviews.Unfortunately, my team didn't like anything on the pre-set menu and the restaurant didn't want to work with them on finding alternates.  I was a restaurant manager, so yeah, I get it - the food has already been purchased and prepped, etc.  But there were only 8 of us; how hard is it to be flexible?  How hard is it to say, "Yes of course, but we will have to charge you separately"?  When a group that is spending a couple thousand dollars on dinner tells you they're going to leave before you even bring the appetizers out, doesn't that concern you?  Wouldn't you send a manager over?If you're Cowboy Ciao, the answer to all of these is no.  What a bummer.I enjoyed a meal here this past Saturday with two girl friends and I have to tell you: THE best barbecue sauce I have had in my life! I am talking about the cherry barbecue sauce that comes on the side with the short ribs (which were pretty dry on their own). I am somewhat embarrassed to share that I was plucking the cherries from the sauce and eating them straight! The short rib was served on cheesy grits and while usually the texture of grits doesn't work for me, these were pretty good. I credit the abundance of cheese with altering the texture. Dessert was also delicious: the cuppa red hot chocolate is a mug filled with two layers of dense chocolate mousse at least one of which is laced with chile that inspires a cinnamon red hot-like burn in the very back of your palette on the finish. Definitely a desert to be shared. We also split the peanut butter mousse dessert which was in a chocolate cookie shell and was much less dense - in fact, it was runny and spilled out of the sides when the shell broke but the peanut butter flavor was perfect and it was accompanied by 3 chocolate covered peanut butter cookie dough balls. One for each of us -- we didn't even have to fight over them! Other great things warranting these stars? We were able to walk in on Saturday night and get a table; the wine list is extensive and includes very accessible options; the portions are huge and the price is moderate - more than a fair deal for the quality of food.It's no secret that I love cowboys. I love anything that has to do with cowboys. One day, I will make a cowboy mine...*ok calming down now* So the decision to dine at Cowboy Ciao was a no brainer! Next, I need to scold myself: WHY haven't I been to Cowboy Ciao for a meal before??? BAD Dottsy! BAD! Moving on... I visited CB's with two friends and didn't know I was going to be hit upside the head with some REALLY. GOOD. FOOD. We were greeted and seated immediately, which was quite a surprise for a Friday night, but there was a table just about to leave so we lucked out. I decided on having the special of the evening which was the Harris Ranch Rib-eye with creamy spaghetti squash. My dear Yelpers, I dream about the dish to this day! I had it perfectly rare which made me a very happy Diva! The spaghetti squash was perfectly cooked and perfectly creamy. It was amazing! I am batting my eyelashes blissfully as I type these words. We also split a dessert that was equally delicious, but I don't remember exactly what it was. I do remember a chocolate cup filled with a peanut butter mousse. Fab! Oh wait! How could I forget the cup of chocolate with chili mixed in? Again, another GREAT dessert...So why not 5 stars? I have yet to return to CB and you all know I don't give it all away on a first date! I excitedly await my next visit to Cowboy Ciao. The food was masterfully prepared and I enjoyed my entire visit!Went for half-priced brunch this weekend and it was awesome! Totally plan to return and pay full price - they're already beyond reasonable! And, there's a delicious assortment of interesting and delicious breakfast cocktails - what more could a brunch-goer want!?!The food is decent, nothing to really go crazy about and not really worth the price. but it's decent and close to work so that makes it easy.the biggest issue i have is with the service. after multiple visits i have come to the conclusion that the servers and employees are friendly but it takes 1.5 hrs to have lunch. and that wouldn't be a problem if i thought the food was spectacular enough to wait that long. and our drinks are almost always empty and the servers are hard to find. i'll most likely continue eating here every now and then bc it's convenient and it's easy to please everyone... but i wouldn't really go out of my way to go here.The word "perfect" can been defined as, "having all the required or desirable elements, qualities, or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be."Based on that definition, the Stetson Chopped Salad at Cowboy Ciao is "perfect"!  If I was a salmon, then ending up in this salad would be the perfect ending to my life.  Ok, that sounds a little weirder to read that it did when it was in my head... but the point is that this salad is absolutely "to die for."  For salmon, that is. The Berkshire Pork Belly comes crispy confit style with roasted Brussels sprouts, shallots, toasted almonds, cheese, and a Oaxacan chile honey drizzle.  I don't have to tell you how good that sounds, just go back and read those ingredients again.  Seriously, I'll wait... go read them again.  Pork Belly makes me smile...Needless to say, the Pork Belly also came close to being perfect!  But... even if the Pork Belly was not perfect, the excellent friendly, timely, and attentive service made this entire experience truly perfect. Way to go, Cowboy Ciao!  In the words of the Governator, I'll be back!So this has been one of the best meals I've ever had, yet I have some constructive criticism. PROS:1. The food is to DIE FOR. The Stenson salad is delicious and the perfect appetizer to split. The truffle mac and cheese is so gooey, i wish there was more of it to share. I had the special, which was a 20 oz. ribeye steak. IT WAS HUGE. Also came with asparagus and this great mashed potatoes. It was seasoned perfectly, it wasnt till halfway through they give you some delicious sauce to pour all on it. Yet, you really dont need it! 2. The servers are very friendly and well seasoned employees, they DEFINITELY know what youre talking about. 3. They do wine flights? Need I say more? Plus, they have one of the most eccentric wine lists, it would take you at least an hour just to read each one. Some offered only by the bottle. 4. They gave me a free shot for my birthday, delicious. ------------------------CONS: 1. The layout of the place, its kind of cramped, especially when you are trying to maneuver around people trying to get to the bathroom.2. The food service, while amazing, was slow. For 2 appetizers and 3 entrees being ordered at the same time, the entire service took 3 hours. It was fine for our party, but not suggested if you are in a rush. 3. A litttttle on the pricey side, while the food was amazing, you cant get an entree and an appetizer for under 50 dollars per person here. Just to warn you, then again, it IS scottsdale. TIP:Make a reservation. On a tuesday night, there wasnt one empty table in sight. people were sitting at the bar just to get some time of meal service. One of my new favorite american places!We were excited to visit Cowboy Ciao last Friday night for a business function which turned into the worst experience of our lives in a restaurant.  I can get over the fact that our entrees took well over an hour to arrive and one of them had a long, blonde hair on the plate to boot.  What I will never get over is how I was treated by the manager after choking on the short ribs at the table - one of the most terrifying experiences of my life.  I'm not sure exactly why this happened; perhaps, because my entree was cooked on the same grill as shellfish, which I'm allergic to.  I started choking and literally threw up at the table in front of my friends and clients and nobody came to help; offer a napkin, glass of water, anything!  (However, I will give the waiter credit for bringing me a mint 15 minutes later.  Lost points though for adding in an auto gratuity for subpar service).  The only time the manager stepped up was 10 minutes later by yelling at our wives for being in the men's room stall with me because I was having a hard time breathing.  And then he had the gall to insinuate that I was drunk.I spend about $40k/year entertaining clients in restaurants and our tab this night was $700 (which I was picking up).  You can bet your ass that I will never set foot in this place again and I will be sure all my business contacts do the same.  The manager should be fired because for being a total disgrace and sorry excuse for a human being.

Review Text :
Yes, it's a chain. But it's a Texas chain that opened it's first restaurant on 6th Street in Austin. That's street cred in my book. I've been to all their Austin locations, but now frequent the one off Mill Avenue in Tempe. Went for lunch just this afternoon as a matter of fact, and it always amazes me how I forget how good the food is between visits, even the complimentary corn bread. Today I ordered the Blackened Catfish Tacos with black beans and rice. Yum. I also recommend the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas and Baked Seafood Enchiladas.I paid my first visit to Z-Tejas during a nice bike ride in Tempe because a co-worker of mine claimed they had a great happy hour. I have passed by this restaurant numerous times and didn't think anything special would come from a visit. I had the notion that this was another typical Mexican chain that was most likely overpriced and overrated. I can only speak for their happy hour, but it was probably one of the best happy hours around town! Everything was so cheap and great quality! I swear by their Chambord Margaritas...They are only $5 and although they seem smaller than expected, they pack a killer punch and tastes great! I was not expecting to feel that kind of buzz from one margarita! They definitely pour heavy with the alcohol!! We were planning on hitting the Chuck box for dinner afterwards so we decided to try an appetizer off of the happy hour menu just to give it a try and munch on a snack until we finished our drinks. That did not happen. We were sooooo full from the pork nachos appetizer that we could not even think about eating anything else. When the waitress brought them out, we were in shock and I guess it happens all the time because she immediately said, " I know, they're huge and the biggest thing you can get for $5 anywhere." (LOOK AT MY PICTURE OF IT) Not only was it humongous, it was incredibly delicious!!! They are extremely generous with all of the toppings (and boy, do they have a lot of toppings). We asked for hot sauce and she brought out sriracha. At first we were like, sriracha? That weird, but she walked away and I love sriracha so I was like I'll give it a try, why not? WOW it surprisingly went perfect with the pork and cheese etc. I can't wait to come back for happy hour again because everything on the menu looked amazing!! Our server was so kind and funny. She was very helpful and helped us choose the perfect meal for the day! I think her name was Christina. I definitely recommend trying their happy hour!! I posted a picture of the HH menu and their hours are in there on the side. Happy Hour is 3-7 Mon-Fri and 2-6 on weekends. Do ITTTTTT!

Review Text :
A tea shoppe serving tea in bags...that can be bought at the local grocery store...tsk, tsk.Some of the food was from Costco (confirmed by our waitress).  My sister and daughter thought the chicken salad made them a little sick.While strolling around Downtown Glendale, the girls and I decided we were hungry.  Upon walking around the many cafe/restaurants, we decided to give Kimberly Ann's a try.When entering, we were overwhelmed by the theme of this cozy little place.  It was pretty cute --- not TOO overkill-y.  There was tons of stuff to look at.  You can say this place borderlines cluttered.  I felt like I was on that TLC show, "Hoarders: Buried Alive!"So anyways, two of the ladies got the quiche with chicken gumbo soup, I had the BLT, and we had some scones afterward.  The quiche just melts in your mouth, the BLT was cooked to perfection, and the Mae's scones were truly the best.  We shared a strawberry scone, a blueberry scone, and a cranberry scone with devonshire cream and lemon curd.  Yummy!Although the chips were a weird non-Victorian touch, I think this place is okay.I wish I could review this place, but after walking past we found it closed...on a Saturday...despite it being 10:30 and the posted business hours said 10-4...I am in favor of helping local business and I enjoy spending money at mom and pop's rather than chains, but it is hard to do when a business doesn't even adhere to their posted hours.I had the misfortune of holding a group function there today.  I had been in touch with the owner for two days before the event to give her the numbers, which ended up bring 16.  I walked in an hour early to set up.  The set up wasn't quite what I asked for so I asked her to adjust it (take three off of one table and put that at an empty four top.   She seemed very put out but did it.  Her two young granddaughters were the only staff there and the place was empty when I arrived.  My function was called for 1:00 but several guests arrive late and 3 did not show up.  Still we had 13 for lunch.  I saw that there were two other rooms in the back, each having 4 tables of 4.  When I arrived she told me we had to leave by 3:00 (those were her exact words)!  That was never mentioned before.  At about 2:00 another party of 4 arrived and were seated in the back room.  I figured since there were coming in so late they couldn't possibly be closing by 3.  Everything was fine, except for the unbelievably slow service.  At the end, everyone paid their bill and left, except for 2 that stayed behind to talk.  I kept asking for my bill and finally got it - The item I ordered was $8.95.  There was also a $50 charge for room rental.  I told the owner that there was never mention of a room charge and had I known there was, I wouldn't have booked my event there.  She said that since she had to hold a whole room for me and was limited to the reservations she could take, I was being charge.  She began to argue with me and I finally stopped and said - "so you don't mind losing the business of 14 new customers?"  And she replied "No, I don't!".  I tried to reason with her but she kept arguing and was very nasty.  She even insulted my two remaining guests by telling them how messy they were.  I was going to charge the amount and then dispute it with my credit card but I was afraid to give her my credit card.  I ended up leaving $20 on the table and left ($10 more than I owed).  A few minutes later she had left a message on my voice mail telling me I could either come back and pay her or she was going to call the police.  I have never encountered such a nasty women in my life.  I'm glad she feels she doesn't need the business because it looks like she's not getting it anyway.  I had 3 less people than I told her, but she had 7 empty tables in the back so I guess she was trying to make up for her own lost income since no one made reservations.The food was good, however, the service was definitely lacking and the decor a bit lacking and tacky.I felt that the food was not worth the cost.  Also, was not happy with the requirement to pay in cash since we used a Groupon. Jane LI used a Living Social coupon for 2 people for high tea at Kimberly Ann's. Sounds like it should be a fun and enjoyable experience, right? Well, it turned out to be a lot of "work". We wanted to go to high tea in December, but they were completely booked. Ok - we were disappointed but we scheduled it for early January. Well, a week or so before the date we were to have high tea, they called and said they would be closed due to plumbing problems. Another disappointment but we rescheduled for later in the month. What made this difficult were all the "rules":1. You need to call at least 24 hours in advance to make the reservation.2. They require a Visa or Mastercard number to hold the reservation. No-show's who do not give 24 hours notice will be charged $25.00 plus tax. (Is this a doctor's office???)3. You must mention any coupon over the phone or you will be charged the full price on the day of your reservation.4. The coupon price does not include tax and gratuity. They suggest a gratuity of 18% - 25% of the original price of $25.00 per person.5. CASH ONLY for the $10.00 "required" gratuity for the coupon plus tax of $2.63 per 2 people. If you do not bring cash, you will both be charged the full price of the high teas.WOW! That's all I can say. While the food was terrific and the service was good, they also had an additional "rule" stating only one type of tea per table. What if one person wants decaf and the other wants caffeinated tea? Too bad! As previously mentioned, there is a "funny" sign on one of the bathroom doors saying: "If you have to go #2, please do not use this restroom." They then direct you to another restroom away from diners. Weird but true! I wish I had taken a picture of the sign.I'm a huge fan of high tea, but I won't go back to Kimberly Ann's. I would recommend the English Rose Tea Room in Carefree for an exceptional high tea experience. Check out their website: www.carefreetea.comAlso, the Biltmore and the Phoenician Resorts have fantastic high tea as well, for a higher price than the English Rose.I was SO excited to go here... One of my clients wanted to thank me for the work we accomplished together and so she treated me to High Tea. I dressed up for the occasion and when we walked up I noticed the sign next to the door announcing the soup and scone and salad (I think?) of the day. It was listed as a walnut scone and since I am HIGHLY allergic I told our server as soon as we were seated that I would need whatever the alternative was due to my allergy. There was no nut free alternative. And on top of that she scolded me like a child for not saying something at the time of the reservation. My client had no clue of my allergy and could not have known. THEN our tray of goodies were brought out and she pointed out everything on the trays that had nuts in it. (Probably close to 75% of the tray was nutty). She half heartedly apologized that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to pick around my allergens.In today's day I am stunned that they are so callous towards such a common issue, and that they couldn't have been bothered to even make me some sandwiches on a different bread so I could enjoy a little more than half a sandwich and some fruit. The tea wad lovely, and the decor was perfect for a tea house, but their total lack of regard was awful. If I had gone on my own I would have demanded a refund and made a but of a scene. As it stands I think I'm going to be letting the health department know about this place....I have very mixed feelings about this place.  I very much enjoyed my tea time with my grandmother.  She enjoyed it immensely.  It was pretty, quiet, and our server (a guy who I thought was the handyman or something) was super nice.  The food was good, the tea was delicious.  As a livingsocial deal, it is ROTTEN.  Getting a reservation was impossible.  I was told I could only make one for Monday thru Friday at 11 or at 2.  And to include gratuity was offensive because on their menu gratuity and tax are included in the $25 per person cost of tea.  And now I gave my extra voucher to a friend to use, because my original reservation in December got canceled due to a flood in their kitchen and I didn't have time to use two vouchers.  My friend was told that the voucher had already been redeemed, which was impossible (the voucher I used didn't even use the name on her voucher).  I don't really understand how this happened.  Or why it wouldn't have been brought to her attention when she made the reservation.  Then, my friend decided to just order off the menu and still hadn't been served after 40 minutes of waiting with her 3 year old daughter.  Overall I wish that they would just stop running the livingsocial deal because it seems like it is only making people mad.  Its a cute place and was a good time but not worth the headache.  I also don't think that it would be worth it at full price.Took my Mother to High Tea today thankfully the owner extended my Living social voucher for one more day.  Boy what a mistake it was buying this deal!! I bought two vouchers but was told I could only use one even if we say at separate tables. Ok so I should read the fine print better.  Our waiter was the only one working today bad sign, we saw him a total of 4 times , had to go find someone for a box and then we were leaving out the back since my mom is disabled . Waiter comes out joking I thought that we were dining and ditching!!! I told him tip is on the table he said it wasn't correct!! Well I am not leaving 12.50$ for his tip !! Talked to the owner who called me cheap and said everyone else left that much ! Not me!! As I was leaving heard waiter say " yah and they tried to leave without paying!! Oh ya me and my disabled mom making a run for it!! Ha ha would not recommend this place to anyone!!!I was so excited to take my mom here for her birthday last year. I bought a groupon months in advance. Problems first started when I tried to make a reservation. The lady did not seem to know exactly what a good time to come and was not very professional. We finally found a time in the early afternoon. When I got there it was very busy and it took a while to get acknowledged. There were a few open tables that still had food sitting on them. We were told to wait outside and someone would show us to our table. We waited and waited outside. I was pregnant at the time and started to feel sick from being hungry and waiting outside. I went in to check. I had to wait about 5 minutes before anyone even came by. The tables were still dirty and the same people were waiting for food. We were told to wait outside some more. We waited for about 50 mins past our reservation before we were even seated. Then we continued to wait some more. By this time I was feeling really sick and needed something in my stomach. Our waitress finally came. She was a young girl and it was her second day. She told us how 3 waitresses did not come but the owner kept sitting walkins so that is why we waited so long. She took our order for tea and what menu we were getting. We sat for another 30 mins without any service, not even tea. Our groupon came with soup so I flagged the waitress asking for our soup while we were waiting for our sandwiches and tea so I wouldn't throw up. She said she would get it right away. It never came. Finally the sandwiches and tea arrived and I didn't throw up, so it was a miracle. This place would have gotten 1 star but the sandwiches and food was really good. The service and management is just terrible. The owner has no business sense  You would be better off to go to your niece or daughters tea room and have a pretend tea than go here.This place is a disaster as a tea house.  Don't go here.We had to wait to be seated, even thought we had a reservation.  The owner and waitstaff were extremely rude and put out to seat us and take our order, even though the place was almost empty.I love tea, and have frequented may tea houses before.  I made a reservation to have tea here,  Apparently, I did not specify that I would want tea and tea sandwiches  when I made the reservation, so we could not have high tea or any type of tea that you would normally get in a tea house.   We had to order off a bistro menu and I had a salad and my friend had a sandwich.  We thought it was a fluke and came back a second time making sure to emphasize we wanted to have tea at the tea house when we made our reservation.  We got there.  More rudeness, more waiting, mediocre food.Skip this place.Called to inquire about High Tea service as a gift for my wife and her sister as sort of a Sister's Date since she was coming from overseas. The people on the phone were so RUDE that I know now why they have such a poor rating. If you don't like customers and they are such a bother to you, why are you in business?The service was excellent from the young man who brought our tea, salads, and lunch items.  No complaints there.The tea was great, the salads, too.  However, the cucumber sandwiches were bitter, and so was the tunafish.  When we told the woman server of this, we were told "Well, sometimes you get a bitter cucumber."  When we asked her to substitute those with the ones we DID like (cranberry chicken salad or egg salad) we were told, "No, the chef already made all she's going to make for the day, and we won't make you more."I about fell off my chair, so did my mom. For a 70th birthday present, I couldn't believe we had to endure 'no substitutions' for SOUR food.! What a joke. We will NOT be returning, and will take our business to better establishments for high tea, like the Ritz.We also did not care for the fact that gratuity and tax were automatically added and would NOT have tipped that much on a $70 bill for such POOR customer service. I'm surprised this place still sticks around, what a disgrace.I attempted to use my living social voucher this afternoon at Kimberly Ann's Tea Room. Had the pleasure of dealing directly with the manager/owner, Kimberly. Unfortunately, she would not honor my voucher stating that it required 24 hour advance reservation. I asked her to show me where in the fine print this stipulation was listed and when she was unable to find it she stated that it was Living Social's fault for not including it. Really? Aren't you in charge of final ad copy as the merchant?? I requested that she apply my voucher to purchase price of anything else on the menu and she refused. I didn't think that was too much to ask. Now she will have to deal with the negative feedback about her establishment/management practices on the internet. Definitely NOT a smart management decision on her part. Below is an exact copy of fine print on my voucher:the fine printLimit 2 per customer, 2 additional as giftsLimit 1 per table per visitValid Monday through ThursdayExcludes holidays including Valentine's Day, Easter, and Mothers Day weekendEntire value must be used in a single visit

OPH how can I 'splain it? Someone called this OPH which stands for "Old People Hangout." Oh contraire mon fraire. There were a hand full of people in their late 20's. Ok...pretty much everyone here was in their 40's or 50's. Lots of divorcees here. So if you're a young single stud...cougar season is year round. This bar provided my first glimpse at a couple getting freaky to a U2 song. Where the Streets have no name will never be the same. Tip the bathroom attendant. I did..after I grabbed my 3rd lollipop. The cover band performing was in their 6th year in Cave Creek? Might be time to get out guys. You blew my mind when you dropped the parents just don't understand line. Wow. 32 ounce beers are dope. Oh and some dude tried to pull my brother-in-law's sweater strings. So my brother-in-law gave him a titty twister. I watched this in a drunken stupor. Don't worry I was gonna step in when they started tickling each other and thumb wrestling.Next time I want to party with my mom this is where I will go, because every single person in there aside from the people at my table were old enough to be my parents. And most of them were apparently swingers.. Lovely. 50+ year old husband/wife swappers looking to score.. The mental pictures are scarring my mind. Excuse me while I barf.Anyway a few friends met up here to watch some football and drink some cheap beer. Who knew it would turn into Beerfestival 2009 accompanied by way too many shots of Jameson. I think this is the only way we all could stand the atmosphere. To top it off the food was not good at all, my Chicken Chimi tasted a little bit like vomit and the sampler was pretty much a roasted pineapple slice with a mound of hard potato strings and 3 overcooked shrimp on skewers growing out of it. To top it off, I was in the ladies room with 25 cougars and a mouse ran across the floor.. imagine 25 half naked 50 year old women bouncing up and down, arms flailing and screaming at the top of their lungs.. because that is what was going on. Ridiculous. I will only go back here if Georgie S. drags me here again for drunken football debauchery.. otherwise, count me out.Cooooouuuuggggaaaarrssss..... here cougar, cougar.....Botox: CheckFakies: Check (including my own)Vaginal Rejuvenation: CheckIt gets worse... yes, can you imagine???Affliction: CheckFaux-Hawks: CheckOverbearing Cologne: CheckNow that I think of it, this is probably a perfect match: Women significantly past their prime and the douchebags of society waiting to pray off of them...I shouldn't judge; I really shouldn't... I may end up here in 26 years when I am at the equivalent age of the majority demographic. In fact, thank god this place exists otherwise we may have to worry about the douchebags and douchebaguettes (credit, Dallas G.) infiltrating our beloved downtown favorites. 2 stars for the mojitos and wasabee dipping sauce.MeeeeoooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwI give up.A friend suggested meeting here for lunch this week. I reluctantly said yes. We were the first ones in. We went to the right and up the few steps to find a table. EVERYONE had dirty chairs and tables with crumbs, obviously from the night before. If i was desperate, there might have been enough food around to make a meal.After looking at each other we decided to try one of the high tops down in the bar area. OK, the chairs were clean and the table top looked clean so we sat. Since there were two of us at a four place, i went to move the salt and pepper out of the way. Not an easy chore since the salt was stuck to the table. Breaking it loose and moving on to move the small appetizer plates, they were stacked for four.The top three slide off, the bottom one stuck to the table. The table had that sticky "someone almost tried to clean it off" feeling to it.To the waitress' credit, after mentioning the upper chairs and tables she got a towel and went to clean them off after telling us it must have been the night crew's mistake - WELL DUH!Again, there's no management at this place. If they would clean up, improve the inconsistent food and get it together, they might do more biz. Maybe they need to call in Restaurant Impossible, OR... just ask their customers. We could all tell them a few things... those of us that care.As a note, it was my friend's first time there wanting to try it. She said she'd never be back. . Maybe my standards for cleanliness and good food are higher than some others but... I always tell it like i see it. ...I give up, I'm done with this hole

How can you go wrong with Casey Moore's,This chill location is like no other, located in the middle of a residential district Caseys offers a chill location compared to the busy Mill Ave.  The wait staff and patrons are great peoples that come to enjoy a good beer and their friends.  Be ready to enjoy a very diverse crowed of people here.  The food,Ok well the food is above average here, personally I like the fries and the sandwich, I won't boast about every item on the menu. Look for the lights on the tree when you driving down Ash.So Casey's has been reviewed up and down on Yelp. I hope to provide some detailed information to help you get the best experience you can when coming to this neighborhood bar.First off, there are beer specials every day. If a review states that the beer was $3.50 it was either on happy hour or was the beer of the day. Most of the beers on draft are regularly $4-$4.50. They also have a decent selection of bottled beers (and Boddington's in the can).They have a board inside at the end of the main bar that has daily specials, this will usually consist of a higher dollar specialty item and desert along with a lower cost lunch type item. Just ask your server and they will give you the run down.If you are in the mood for a very fast appetizer, the clams or shrimp will arrive in usually less than 5 minutes. Other apps come out as usual 10-15 minutes. Sandwiches and salads run about the same time depending on what needs to be cooked. I personally recommend the Hippy Sandwich with Blackened Chicken.If you are looking for less of a crowd avoid Thursday-Saturday, as said before the bar is very popular and the weekend warriors come out in packs. Tuesday is a great day to come out, the special is Black and Tans but you can get either Bass or Guinness for $3.50 all day/night. A good place to park is the alleyway behind Buffalo Exchange or the parking lot to the east of it. If it's a busy night don't even try to get in the main parking lot.Sunday's a bartender named Tyler works the outside bar and he makes a seriously spicy Bloody Mary. He also loves to high five, don't let him down.Hope this info helps you have a good time at this great neighborhood spot, see you at the bar.Quick attentive bartenders. NoConvenient parking. NoPatrons above the age of 24. NoHot waitresses. No.Slow Waitresses. Yes.Everlasting brodeo. Yes.Dirty Bathrooms. Yes.Douchebaggery all around. Yes.Unfresh oysters. Yes. $3 kiltlifter. Yes.Asshole cops that follow you home afterwards. Yes.I decided that I pretty much hate this place. Sorry, I just do.I almost died at Casey Moore's!  Okay, that might be a bit of an overstatement.  I'm sitting in a booth and enjoying my first visit to Casey's when a drunk guy decided to lean against one of those outdoor gas heaters and almost knocked it over on me.  I think I yelled "oh my God" in horror as it tipped over in my direction, but thankfully it was more like one of those Weebles preschool toys.  You know, Weebles wobble but they don't fall down.  Then he actually tried to lean against it again!  After a few awkward moments, he finally realized what a horrible idea that was and moved on.  It reminds me of the time I saw a waiter try to put some candles out at the end of the night.  He kept using his fingers to extinguish the flame and kept getting burned, over and over again until he realized that he could just blow it out.  Why are some people so stupid? I loved the idea of Casey's.  The patio is awesome.  The food is basic.  I ordered the seafood sandwich and the waitress said they used imitation crab meat.  Not a big deal for me but I know a lot of people hate it.  Something I didn't know is that the process of making imitation crab was developed in Japan over 800 years ago... or so I read.  What the hell, did I just make this review useful?! Anyway, great place to grab drinks.  Just avoid jerks who use gas heaters to steady themselves.I have enjoyed some tasty food here in the past, but I won't be stepping foot in here again.  One of their bouncers, who refers to himself as "G", decided that it would be completely acceptable to let some transphobic words escape his mouth.  Now, in no way am I a transgender individual, but I do have much respect for the trans community and I can't believe this place would keep this dude around.  So, my girlfriend had to use the restroom and there was a huge line, so she peeked around to see if there was the same traffic jam by the guys bathroom and this dude just comes at her all aggressive like telling her she needed to get away and all that...which she was quick to move and apologize.  But then she asked him, "What if I was a transgender person?" To which this guy replied "Well then you can get out."  Really dude?  So, she informs the manager of this and he was on her side for sure.  The bouncer then began harassing her again and was trying to kick her out of the bar (for what?! Right...he didn't say) and she called to the manager that he was still being aggressive with her.  The three of them went to have a talk and the bouncer was trying to say that she called him the "N" word...UM MY GIRLFRIEND IS BLACK TOO JACKASS!  She never uses that word and would NEVER call someone that because she actually is a respectable person and isn't ignorant.  Did the manager say anything to the bouncer about his transphobic comment??  Did he?! NO!! I later called to ask what the manager's name was, and found out that not only is Gavin a manager but he's also part owner...you've got to be kidding me.It's a real shame when you let your employee harass a guest who didn't do anything but try to go pee.  Yelp folk, whether you're gay, straight, bi, queer, trans, a straight ally or something of the like, I strongly urge you to steer clear of this establishment and spend your money where this kind of behavior is not tolerated.Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.Visit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.Visit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.Visit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?Visit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, "I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there." Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, "There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar..." "We don't." He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). "No, I told you we don't." Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.I mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way.For March's International Supper Club UYE, we went lookin for a lil luck of the Irish and headed on down to Casey's Moore's Oyster House. I liked the feel and the look of the place, very woody, felt like it could be a pub in Dublin.  We arrived around 6:30 and our server let us know it was Happy Hour till 7 and that all apps were  1/2 off, so after checking out the app menu I went with the potato skins. They were potato halves stuffed with green chilies topped with melted cheese, chives and bacon with a side of ranch. These were good tasting potato skins!After checking out the menu I went with Casey's homemade Crab Cakes, sometimes I crave crab cakes, it's crazy I know.  These crab cakes are handmade and severed with fried served with homemade chipotle remoulade. I wasn't that impressed with the crab cakes, to me they were over fried, and the chipotle remoulade just tasted greasy.  Maybe the kitchen was having a bad nice because some of the other dishes that came out where not that great either. Or maybe this is the place to hit for Happy Hour drinks & Apps?Our serve was great, even though it stated on the menu 1 check per table, he gave us all separate checks. I thought that was nice of him to do.

I really had the most unusual second experience here. The waitress's remembered us and the Chef ran out to take our order. He said he wanted to make us a special meal for us and said I remembered you like spicy. I said I'd like something with fish and vegetables. The waitress translated what I said to him and he ran to the kitchen. Soon out comes these tasty silken tofu cubed bowls that were lightly battered holding these tiny shrimp with a tasty dipping sauce.Next comes out this big bowl of hot and sour soup. The soup had lots of tofu threw it, pork and shrimp. Also some fresh made fried noodles that were very crisp and made with fresh clean oil. The soup was well made.Then we get a big plate with Sea Bass and Bok Choy. The fish was very fresh tasting and moist. The bok Choy was crisp and tasty. The sauce was silky smooth made very carefully from stock with taste of garlic a spicy pepper and the perfect amount of salt.Our two drinks and all this food only cost $26.00 before tip.As I said in my previous review. If you aren't Asian they give you the Americanized Chinese Menu. I note they have a Hong Kong Menu and Many Menus written in Chinese all over the walls here that change Often. I also note this isn't a fancy place.I don't think you are going to find another place like this anywhere.Update 5-30-15 As of April-2015 This restaurant was sold to new owners

Review Text :
We set out to find Bavarian Point restaurant and stumbled into Zur-Kate by accident.  They are next door to each other, although I had never heard of Zur-Kate before.  What a stroke of luck.The atmosphere was very cozy with lots of German flair.  The place was very crowded at 8pm, and everyone seemed to be having a very god time.  The first thing we noticed about the menu was the far lower prices than the ones on menus we had seen on line for other Valley German restaurants.  Many different kinds of wurst, schitzel and chops are available to choose from.  Each entree comes with a choice of German potato salad, spatzel, potato cake, home fries or french fries.  You also receive your choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage.  A salad bar is included, and basket of rye bread delivered to the table.  There is not an entree on the menu over $12, and you can add a wurst to any entree for $2.50.  Beers are in the $2-$4 range - where does that happen?  These prices are already amazing, but then you see the portion sizes.  The schnitzels are huge, and each comes with a generous portion of side.  I had the Rhein Schitzel - juicy pork, lightly breaded and fried until golden bown and crisp, topped with sauteed onions and a sour-cream based light gravy.  It was fantastic.  Very well seasoned, light, not greasy and absolutley huge.  Add in the red cabbage and spatezel and you have a formidable meal.  I added a knockwurst just to try it, and there was no way that I could finish my dinner.  Everyone at my table felt the same about their meals.  This place is a gem and should not be missed.  I really cannot imagine what more you could want out of a German restaurant, except maybe higher prices.  Im sure the other restaurants in town are also good, but we cant wait to go back to Zur Kate.Who even knew such a good, authentic place existed way out here in the East Valley.  The place has been around for like 20 years.  The decor inside makes you feel like you're in Germany.  The wait staff was very nice and I thought the food was VERY good.  I had the sausage loaf with gravy, cabbage and these unreal home fried potatoes fried with bacon, OMG.  So good.  My date had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and potatoes.  I thought the brats were excellent as well.They have a nice bar with a lot of German beers.  The price was not bad, 2 dinners, 1 beer was about $24.00.Also note, their gravy is gluten-free!  Whoot.

Review Text :
I think this family made the very first pizza I ever tasted. That's the story I'm going to stick with anyway (it was probably Chucky Cheese in reality). I have been a rabid fan of the pizzas they make for over 25 years. I remember when they were on Camelback near 44th Street. As a kid, I remember being afraid to try it, but after some coaxing I became a huge fan. Then they moved to the Scottsdale and Shea location... I have most of my memories of it here. Their kids opened a spinoff location on Indian School and 46th, but that eventually closed - it was never quite the same (though it was similar). The Scottsdale and Shea location finally closed two years ago much to my dismay.I only recently discovered this location way the hell up north. I'm glad to see them still making pizza (yeah, it's the same people - I recognized the chef/owner), and I'm even more glad to find that it's just the same as I remember. The crust is simple, the sauce is mild but plentiful, the cheese is gooey and high quality, and the toppings are fresh and delicious. Everyone has their favorite pizza and this is mine. Nothing has changed about it in a quarter of a century. It's still awesome. I always get Sausage and Pepperoni in case you're wondering.Aside from the quality of the food (which is amazing), the staff is nice. The interior needs a little work (it's kinda ugly - they should at least go back to the checkerboard tablecloths). The place kinda stinks too for some reason. It's not the food though... I don't know what the deal was with that. As soon as our pizza came, the smell went. Maybe someone ordered a stinky sandwich? Or maybe someone's colostomy bag needed to be emptied... I mean, the customers were a little on the silverhair side today. I'm sure it varies a lot. I do love the food here - I wish they would move close to me.Oh, and as has always been the case, the prices are pretty reasonable. It was less than 20 bucks for the two of us. Go check it out - definitely worth the trip.Good but not great. Friendly. Empty.The above capture my experience at Pizzafarro's, an intended quick stop before catching a flight back to a strange and distant habitat where 95 is considered hot. Arriving shortly after 5 on a Tuesday, we were the only dine-in patrons until right before we left when a lone diner arrived, signaling either a general or specific off-season.We settled on a loaf of garlic bread without melted cheese ($3.50) and a two-topping large 16' (~$23) with spinach and mushrooms. A brief aside - I come from the land of NY style pizza, and currently live in the land of not much resembling pizza. Under that lens, the garlic bread was a bit weak on the garlic and it was the best and will be the best pizza I've had in months with the right amount of oil and cheese, but the standard crust was a bit too hard and dry for me to appreciate it when compared to my memories of pizza in the NY area and the price seemed a bit high even for a boutique community. Pizzafarro's has mostly a monopoly on its market in its surrounding neighborhood and history to sustain it, since the commercial zones of Carefree (and Cave Creek) are practically non-existent. For a near the only game in town establishment, for convenience or in a hurry, one could do far worse, but there are better options (consider N.Y.P.D.) if one doesn't mind a short drive, already an Arizona residency requirement.

Review Text :
If you can call a place that's been around for over 20 years a hidden gem, then I guess that's a good description of Karsen's. If I hadn't met dayside bartender Heidi at another location I would never have known of this place and I've probably walked by it numerous times in the past.Located on 1st Street in Old Town Scottsdale, Karsen's is a great place for comfort food like burgers, salads, soups, and patty melts. Karsen's also sports a full bar.In addition to the food, the other item that's clearly kept Karsen's going all these years is the atmosphere. The staff and the owners clearly know and value their regulars and you can tell that the regulars reciprocate. Even going in as a new customer I was made to feel very welcome and that's the type of service that builds loyalty.If you want a no-pressure, low key place to get food or drinks in Old Town Scottsdale, check out Karsen's Grill, you won't be disappointed.

Review Text :
Stopped in for lunch just after 11 today.  The parking was already almost full even though there were plenty of empty tables inside.  The sign, that I didn't see for a couple of minutes, said to seat myself so I picked a table.  Just by myself I would have like a two top but all of the seating arrangements seemed to be 4-6.  The restaurant never filled up so I didn't feel bad for taking a space away.  I got a two item lunch special ($7.25) of a beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans (I could have had rice rather than beans).  I also got a root beer ($2.05).  Most of their drinks have an extra charge for refills but this was not a small glass and was plenty.  Right after I seated myself a bowl of warm chips, a small mixing bowl, a carafe of mild salsa and a bottle of hot sauce were on the table.  It was neat being able to adjust the heat of my salsa.  The shredded beef was very tasty and the shell was thin and crisp without being hard to bit through.  I would suggest eating the tacos quickly before the shell gets soggy. The enchilada and the beans were ok.  The sauce was a bit different than some other places.The service was quick and attentive.  You can tell they are used to getting the lunch crowd in and out in a reasonable amount of time.They have a couple of other weekday lunch specials as well as some smaller appetite options of  their regular menu items that can be ordered anytime.Whopping portions and exemplary service combine with excellent-tasting Mexican food to make Pedro's a Mexican restaurant worth your drive and money.Regular customers fill the seats which reflects the excellent service.  Chips and homemade salsa are delivered almost instantly after being seated, and the entrees are delivered quickly.  I had the 3 mini beef taco, tostada, and tacquito combo (picture is attached) and it was enormous and very tasty.  I was hungry and could only eat half, so it could definitely be enough for two people to split.Part of what brought me here was the buy-one, get-one coupon in the Entertainment Book.  So, even though my combo was normally $12, it averaged out to $6 after the coupon.  On the downside, the place is pretty tacky and the building is outdated.  But, I'm willing to overlook it once I realized the quality that they serve.  In short, Pedro's is arguably one of the better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!

Never have I been so disrespected by an employee at an establishment.  Maybe you should think about how you make money, and how creating a bad rap for yourself hurts only you.I went in last night for one beer about 9pm and sat at the little outside bar deal in the back. The female bartender was passing out calendars and drink coupons to everyone at the bar EXCEPT me. She totally skipped over me and when I asked "where's mine" I got a total fucking attitude. She told me I never asked for one and I explained I'm not a mind reader and she should have offered. She didn't offer to get more, she didn't apologize, whatever. A couple minutes later the couple two stools down from me said this is a great calendar and I replied that I wouldn't know. The bartender then flipped out and started telling the couple, not me, how she has no problem "owning these stupid ASU kids that can't handle their liquor." Way to judge, bitch. I'm not an ASU student and I've only had 1/2 beer at this point. I called for a manager and told him I have 1/2 a beer left, I'm not paying for it, I'm leaving and never coming back, and I'm going to tell everyone I know about how rude your bartender is. He gave me all sorts of free coupons for the block party, $1 drink coupons, and of course that calendar I wanted. I'm still not going back, ever, no matter hot skankily hot the cocktail waitresses are.Lame, the place is crammed and stinks. The drink was ok and the price was ok. Some "ratard" spilled my drink because he was oogeling over my wife while she danced on the bar. (can't blame him, and he did buy me another) doubt I would be back.

Review Text :
I'm as afraid to write this review as I was to admit:...My love for Anne Murray songs..."I cried a tear, you wiped it dry..."...How sometimes I chew my toenails off...(and save them for salad toppings.)...That yes, once, once for a year or so, I smoked Capris Ultra Lights. Menthol. 120s. But I went to Olive Garden. And I enjoyed it. Stuffed mushrooms. Better than Oregano's. Fettuccini Alfredo...sauce clinging to noodles like The Hills girls to their careers....just barely and not smothering. The infamous salad...you know what?...quite good and with those galdarn breadsticks, almost orgasmic. Rickie's Marsala chicken...perfect...really! I had generic wine with great service and left very happy. Shout out to Stephanie especially who served and put up with a gaggle of urbanites in tacky paper tiaras. And a mini shout out to Susan who assisted for putting up with the gang but not having quite the mojo as Stephanie. Olive Garden. Ugh. Don't make fun of me for eating here. Don't reprimand me for clogging yelp with a tacky chain review. Just don't! I had fun. We ate. Even took home leftovers. I'm from Minnesota and have no idea what authentic Italian food is. I'm SURE this isnt' it. And those who complain that it's not are clearly delusional. IT'S NOT. But tonight was a blast and worthy of a solid 3.5 star review. Thank you for dining with us this evening and have a good night.-Consistant food.-Good service.-Not too long of a wait.-Parking was convenient.-Updated decor.-Area is questionable.

Review Text :
I bought a Groupon for Bravo Bistro after reading other positive reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. The groupon was $44 which included a dinner for 2 (seemingly an amazing deal). It was supposed to include any appetizer, any 2 glasses of wine, and any 2 entrees. The groupon explicitly stated that the value of the deal was $124 (up to $16 appetizer, 2x$16 wine, 2x $38 entree).When I sat down to the table and explained that I was using a groupon, I was surprised when the house menu was taken from my grip and replaced with a small green piece of paper detailing the "Groupon Menu". On this menu, the most expensive entree was $22 and none of the large 2 person appetizers were included. My $124 valued groupon now felt like it was worth MUCH less.Needless to say, we were furious. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over an acted very smug while he explained to me that this was the groupon menu that I had to order from.The manger listened but seamed to care little that the restaurant was completely misleading customers with the groupon deal. After a 10 minute argument, he agreed to to "accommodate us" and gave us the normal menu back. I then ordered the Veal Ossobucco (my favorite dish and the reason for us coming to Bravo Bistro in the first place).I'm then told that they are all out of Ossobucco! Of course, how convenient. And they also wouldn't allow us to order any of the specials either.We paid for our two glasses of wine, left, and refunded our Groupon by emailing support@groupon.com.We'll never go back.There are plenty of great restaurants in the Old Town area. I'd recommend staying far away from this place -- Don't be temped by misleading groupon deals!

On a whim we tried Brisam's last night over Cocomo Joe's strictly based on Yelp reviews.  So glad we did.  It's got a great vibe, great staff and fantastic food.  The clam chowder is probably the best I've ever had in Phoenix.  My fiance had a spicy chicken sandwich that was top notch, I had the killer mac n cheese, and it was as advertised, killer.  Incredibly cheesey and huge portions, I had the rest of it for lunch today.  We split chicken strips as an appetizer, they were the only part of the meal that wasn't amazing, but they were still very good.  Our server was incredibly attentive (glass of water never got close to half empty and the restaurant was hopping) and friendly, and the host (also assuming the owner) dropped by the table a few times and was very personable.  We've lived less than a mile away for nearly a year, and had never even heard of Brisam's, but will certainly be back.

Great service.  Make sure you call to make a reservation.  It can maybe hold 25 people maximum inside. Yes they do have outside seating, but it can get cold during the winter.  Even with the outdoor heaters going.  I like the home feel of the place, I felt like I was eating inside a friends home.  The food is the same as it is comfort food.  I felt very satisfied when I left.  The sample plate was great and gave me an idea of what the food was like.I did enjoy the service, nice home feel of the place, and the food.  If you want to try Polish food in Arizona, this is the place.

-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place, but it is a casual sit-down, full service restaurant. They even had margaritas for $2.-REALLY good food, BIG portions! $9.95 for a Carne Asada plate loaded with guac, rice, and beans. Not super cheap like a 'Bertos, but decent prices.-FAST & friendly service! The food was brought out by the time we started digging into the chips and salsa...like SUPER fast!-Chips & Salsa were delicious with the wonderful taste of fresh ingredients. They also have extra "burn your mouth" spicy upon request.-Clean restrooms. Convenient parking.-Located in a 1/2 dead strip mall, next to Peter Piper Pizza on the west side of the Metrocenter Mall.-I would eat here again for sure!

Friendly service, mediocre food. With such close proximity to Chinatown, there's really no reason to stop here when better choices are a block away. Simple setup, Americanized dishes, relatively low prices, $15 limited-area delivery minimum.The beef & broccoli consists of a little beef, a bit of broccoli, and, inexplicably, a lot of carrots and mushrooms as filler? I like mushrooms but really don't care for carrots, this was an unpleasant surprise. Sauce was decently flavored but on the watery side. Portion for price wasn't as great of a value as I had anticipated.Wor Won Ton Soup was incredibly disappointing. Takeout container is packed with tons of chicken, some shrimp, and a lot of fresh produce, and the won ton skins held up well. But the broth is unforgivably weak and flavorless! Rice To Go (cheesy name and all) is a far better option for quick, takeout Chinese with better selection and quality, get thee to Decatur & Spring Mountain instead.

What the!! Am I really the first to review this spot? There have to be about 150 Yelpers within an 5 block radius of this place! But, no reviews! Makes me want to grab a can of spray paint and tag them!All righty then, here goes!I don't always need to make my own lunch or go someplace fun for lunch, sometimes you just need a good, serviceable sandwich or a bowl of soup, for a quick decent lunch. Someplace that isn't a drive-thru, isn't greasy (I suppose they could add grease if that's how you roll), congested (I mean in the automotive sense rather than then bronchial sense...although the fumes from most drive drive thru's make me long for a plugged sinus).Pacific's is a sweet little family run (apparently, they speak passable English and they always have trouble understanding me when I tell them my sandwich was terrific...a nice touch is that they all bow when I thank them...they are beyond adorable!) operation.They make, as noted above, a really serviceable sandwich (I'm fond of the egg salad with some chopped olives on it) and decent soups, as well. The place is very clean (they always hustle out to wipe down tables, even though they are busy behind the counter, making sandwiches, etc.), and smells good, too (like a good food joint should).I know they also do breakfast (which I cannot comment on...if I go out to breakfast, I want to make count with something like the Breakfast Joynt or Matt's).This little spot isn't easy to find, frankly. It has an Indian School Rd. address, but it's 1/2 block north of the street in the office complex by another one of the statues of Winfield Scott (we should start a new game and see if we can't find and count all of the statues to the Scotts...including that delightful paean to Mrs. Scott in the park...you know, the one with her on the horse looking like she has the worst case of constipation in American history).At any rate, try to find this place and have a sandwich. It's pretty good food, freshly prepared (like Subway only clean and nice), at a good price.

This was my favorite dive bar back when I thought a dive bar had to be absolutely rank. I recently returned a few times after years of having been away and realized why i had stayed away so long. The service varies depending who your server is. The beer is awful. Just a shitty selection. Really effing shitty. I seemed to remember their buffalo chicken strips being delicious but I must have been drunk out of my goddamned gourd. They were dry and had almost no sauce. Oh and don't listen to what anyone may tell you...LandShark is not tasty beer.I also remembered why this is the only bar I have been kicked out of for getting into altercations. Almost all of the patrons were ass hats speaking total douchery and making me sick to my stomach as they used their smooth lines on the waitress such as "Why don't you want to go home with my friend? He is hung like a horse. Har har har"Never have I been to a bar with so many children seated at the booths. "You have a baby!...at a bar...""OK so why two stars Nathan?" you may be asking yourself,  "you seem to be really getting riled up about this place, why not give it one?"The jalepeno cheese steak sandwich is sooo effing good. Dirty real dive bar food...sooo good. Go during the day when no one is there and do not drink the Land Shark...it is not tasty beer.

Holy Shit! That was the best brownie I've ever eaten!The 5 Layer Brownie is 5 layers of Luscious Sinful Heaven!Devils food brownie base with cream cheese filling topped with chocolate chips, marshmallows and fudge OH MY! (see pics)I also got a Sugar Cookie frosted with cream cheese and a Giant  ginger snap the size of my face, both delicious! (see pics)Cute little cafe offering soup, Boars-Head sandwiches and a few salads, but it looks like there money  maker here is the baked treats. That's what I had and the other customers were all eating the treats too.They have about 10 different types of cookies and 7 or 8 bars, all generously sized and reasonably priced. I can't wait to try them all.5 stars for the brownie at least , maybe I'll try the food some time.Stop in for your 5 layers of heaven! You'll Thank Me Later~-Sandwiches are pricey. Nothing special.  $7.50+ (includes a pickle and small cookie.)-Lunch lines not very organized, moved slowly.-I would give 5-stars for the cookies, they are really GOOD!-Beverage area is in the next room, found this confusing. Too much chit-chat among employees behind the beverage counter, instead of helping customers.-Pretty decor. Plently of tables to eat at.-Very friendly employees.-Parking (1 hour) is along Main St or parking lot around the corner.This review is based solely on the baked treats here, but don't worry I'll be back soon to try out everything else on the menu too! But let's start with the sweets. What do I think? Well let me quote the famous yelper Sarah G...holy shit! First off, the store itself is adorable. It reminds me of a neighborhood family cafe in a small town. It's wholesome, clean, the staff is friendly and there's plenty of seating all around. I saw a boy comfortably doing some work in one corner and a group of chatty friends having fun in another corner. The baked goods are prominently displayed and it's hard not to leave with some...especially since they conveniently had a whole plate full of cookie samples! My waistline hates me but I'll deal with it later. It was well worth it! The cookies are reasonably priced for their size. They are $1.50 and about the size of small clock. They had oatmeal chocolate chip, sugar cookies with frosting on top, peanut butter M & M, oatmeal toffee, chocolate chip and many many more. Since I was in the area, I had to stock up for the weekend, so I left with three different kinds. I think my favorite is the sugar because of the yummy frosting and then secondly, I like the simple yet succulent chocolate chip. I will definitely be sharing with my bf otherwise I will be rolling down the aisle at my friend's wedding in a couple weeks!As I was about to walk out with my cookies, I was handed a brownie for the road. I couldn't say no and I am so happy I didn't! Before I was even 2 miles away, I opened the wrapping and took a little bite. You try having one of these little guys next to you without your will power taking a nap so you can take a bite!The slices of heaven known as the brownies are squishy because they are topped with ooey gooey chocolate. The ooey gooey chocolate is surrounded by marshmallows, cream cheese, chocolate and a secret sauce. I mean, it's got to be a secret sauce because they are delicious. They are rich, cream, chewy, delicious....etc etc etc. I see why

Review Text :
El sol bakery is one of those places that everyone says "You have to go there" or "OMG....it is so good."  So over the past 5 years I have gone there 3 times.  Each time swearing that I would not go back for any reason, then like every victim of abuse I find myself going back to the same place that has hurt me so many times before, thinking "This time will be different."  and "Maybe it was my fault, if only I was a better customer.". The food here is good.  I have always liked the food, once I have gotten it.  But there in lies the problem with El Sol Bakery. Every time I have gone in to place an order for take out, it has taken over 1/2 hour for them to get the food to me.  Have you ever had to sit there and look like a dope waiting for your take out order?  Well if you haven't, let me give you brief snipet/summary of the conversation that played out in my head, wit my self.10 minutes after ordering:Man...this is taking a while....Can't rush good food... heh...Hmmm... lets look at my phone.15 minutes after:Boring...Hey! how in the fuck did that guy get his food, he just walked in.I am so hungry.Really?  That lady came in like a full ten minutes after me....This is horse shit.I did order didnt ?20 minutes:Am I losing my mind? Did they forget about me?Should I be a dick and say something?25 minutes:Berrber grrrrmmmdrib!Really?What the Fuck?She knows I am here, she just looked at me.Thats it. I need to say something.30 minutes:GOD MOTHER FUCKING DAMMIT!!! I AM LOSING MY MIND!All I wanted was a Burrito. That is it. A simple little burrito.I did order didnt I? Did I already say that? Hmm...what was the answer?Well did I?I have been here all morning.  It is going to start looking like I like to hang out here.That is it. I am going to burn this dump to the ground.  That'll teach em. I am not even hungry any more.And then sometime beyond 35 minutes, she brings over my order and I like the dope that I am just smile and say "Thank you" and walk out.  Why do I take such a beating over a stupid food item?  Why don't I ever say something?  Why do I go back knowing that these people are going to systemically push me over the edge?  Why does it take over a half hour to make a burrito?  Really it is not worth it.

I've never been a fan of Quizno's and this location in particular isn't great. The service is always subpar. When we approach the counter I always feel like I'm bothering them. They barely utter a word of greeting and can't seem to be bothered to even crack a smile or ask if we're ready to order. On every occasion I have been here I have to start the interaction which is a little annoying. We came here recently because I'm a Groupon addict and I just can't seem to resist. I'll stick to Firehouse Subs and Subway in the area instead.

As an update to my previous review, I have since learned that the staff here was extremely rude to my wedding coordinator and the caterers on the day of the event.  Very sad to learn that as I loved the place.Additionally, I had to contact them weeks later to determine the status of my security deposit.  At the time they explained to me the reasons why I was not receiving any of it back, and I won't argue that with them, it was in the contract; however, send me a letter or call me and let me know.  I shouldn't have to track you down to find this out.Not sure why, but I feel a bit like I'm in a fairytale land when I walk into this place :) Surely the 7 dwarfs or the mad hatter are sipping tea in one of the many nooks & cozy corners!The loose leaf tea is great. Take a moment to open up the containers & take a nice big ol' whiff before you decide on 'the one'. The best one as of now in my opinion also doubles as aromatherapy, lol! It's black tea & coconut, yum!The food is all made from scratch & so far I know that the Bungalow Salad, Curry Chicken sandwich & the Enlightened One sandwich are all FANTASTIC :)Add to all of this that you are in a lovely historic home & that the owners & employees make you feel like you are a wanted & welcomed guest & it all adds up to a truly relaxing & delightful experience.P.S. they offer yoga if you want to work off your food OR make room for more ;)Been here twice. Vastly different experiences; the first was five stars, and the second was 0, so I'll average it out to 2.5 and round down.I found this place via yelp, and I have to say I was not let down by the yelp reviewers who heaped praise on this place. Fresh, healthy food; lots of seating options including couches for lounging, tables for having lunch or doing a little bit of work, free wifi, and a very unique setting that's uncommon in the east valley. On that visit I was 100% satisfied; ordered a sandwich and sat for an hour or so at a table in the back.I raved about it a few times to my wife, knowing she would appreciate the garden vibe of the place and its healthy options. So one day, I convinced her to stop in and try it. She is 9 months pregnant and very uncomfortable, and was meeting me there with our hungry toddler in tow. Having just come from a grocery store with two small items that needed to remain cold, we were in an admittedly uncommon situation - needing to find a way to keep our cold food cold for the 20 minutes it would take us to have a quick sandwich. I chose this place that day because I remembered the great mom-and-pop vibe it had, and thought if anyone in the area could accommodate our need to refrigerate these two things (the size of small lean cuisine boxes, factory sealed), it would be these folks. I also had the realistic expectation that there might be some health code rule against it or something, so I politely asked, explaining that if we couldn't keep our food cold, we would have to leave. The owner was downright impolite - she had two large coolers/refrigerators, but said they were full of 'her food.' That was that. I explained that we just had these two very small items and if we could just borrow some space for a half hour, we would have a $30 lunch... she then held up a separate, portable igloo cooler that would have been perfect for our items, but still inexplicably said no. Another customer piped up and suggested a plastic bag with some ice in it, which would also have worked, so we both looked to the owner, who just said no and went back into the kitchen. It was honestly such a strange interaction, and goes so fully against the grain of how a locally-owned small business tends to act toward customers, that I have to boycott this place and recommend you do the same. Sure, they have a nice concept, but there are other places around that serve good food in a nice environment and who will treat me better. It seems like I'm in the tiny minority here on Yelp, so perhaps I caught her on a bad day. A very bad one.I've never reviewed before but I thought I needed to say something about this place. I wanted this place for my wedding more than anything. I saw it online and my fiancé and I decided to go to their open house they hold on Wednesdays.  We get there a little early and go in and check it out. I ask if I can have more informations on the weddings they hold there and the owner just hands me an information packet that is already online. She said the open house starts at 5 30 so I thank her and we go and wait. Her husband comes out and turns on all the lights and tells us we can look around and this is around 5 10. He tells us to go inside if we have any questions. I'm done looking and I go inside to talk and get more information. I go up to the owner and she claps her hands together and goes " ok it doesn't start till 5 30, thank you" and walks off. Really? It's 5 20 and you are standing doing nothing! why are you being so rude? Plus I was just told to come in here and ask you if I had questions!  We go outside to leave and her husband stops us and tells us he can show us and help us. Another couple comes in and she is nice as pie to them. Based on what that other review said about this lady I would never have your Wedding here.  If you own a wedding venue be prepared to be nice to people. I would have been ready to sign papers if only she was nice to us. Found a much better venue after this experience but wow blew my mind!Coffee was good but the service left a bit to be desired.  The older couple who waited on me started off pleasant but quickly turned on me as I requested a decaf americano ( i guess they like caffeine) with a pump of mocha ( he corrected me " chocolate") and extra room for cream. It seems the request for extra room was against the rules here.  Betty ( the lady making my coffee) gave me the look of death while the other guy suggested " sounds like a latte to me". So, if you want coffee your way- go to Lo Fi down the street, if you want it Betty's way then come here:) ps. if you are allergic to nuts, beware-they don't label  it as suchInside the Bungalow was like discovering part of downtown Mesa's historical treasure. At nearly a century old this charming home has been transformed into a whimsical café. The patio is inviting, the décor is delightful, and the friendly service immediately makes you feel right at home. I visited for the first time this past Saturday morning and my only regret is not finding the Bungalow sooner. I brought my Mom and daughter with the intention of ordering a coffee, or tea and perhaps one of their baked goods. To my surprise what we uncovered was a lovely café with more than meets the eye, be sure to look up the twisted chimney once you've entered the kitchen. There are cozy tables chairs and even books, magazines and board games too. They  drink menu consists of coffee and tea, espresso (hot or iced) Chai lattes, Italian sodas, twisters (blended drinks) in coffee flavors, green tea and creamsicle , and they offer smoothies too! The cashier offered the option of hot chocolate with whipped cream to my daughter's delight and even a few ice cubes to cool it down. They have several baked goodies; we chose a fudge brownie and 2 magic brownies (no not that kind) but irresistibly made with a graham cracker crust, coconut, chocolate chips, butterscotch and walnuts with two tasty Chai lattes to wash them down. They have breakfast and lunch sandwiches, even healthy options several salads, a Thai peanut tofu wrap, a hummus platter and a veggie pita.  While we were there  for over an hour I might add; they starting setting up their beautiful garden court yard for a wedding which they told us they host quite often. Open Mic nights are on Wednesday evenings so if your talented as well as hungry you can go for that too. This is sure to be my new home away from home, I can't wait to return. If you're in the area be sure to pay them a visit, you won't regret it!My mother decided to go here with coworkers for their lunch break because the food is diverse and can suit all their dietary needs, such as gluten free, corn free, and vegetarian. This used to be a place they went to often to eat a good meal. Too bad for the owners, they have lost the business of a large department of regular customers. Why is this do you ask? Well the story is a very dramatic one that does not reflect kindly on the owners of this little joint. Looking at the other reviews on this page, I would say that many other customers have received the same kind of treatment. The owner was atrocious. I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in an industry where you serve food and you have earned a reputation, chances are you're going to get a lot of customers. If you cannot handle that, you should probably close shop or hire staff to help out in the establishment. Today, the owner decided to tell my mother that they were not able to serve a party of 6 or more, and if they ever wanted that, it was required that they call 24 hours in advance. No where, not on the web page or in person, is this policy displayed. It is entirely new to our knowledge. Not to mention, they were not a party, instead they were a group of coworkers who happened to go to the same place at the same time. Coincidence? Not particularly when your place of work is close by. Two of her coworkers were taken aback by how the owner nastily told them about this policy and decided immediately to eat elsewhere. My mother and the last three coworkers were hungry and wanted to eat immediately. Upon seeing that they were staying, the owner decided to tell them that since it was only her husband in the kitchen, the food was going to be served very slowly. It was almost as if she did not want them as customers and was trying to get them to leave. They decided to order anyway, there was not much time to go elsewhere after the nice long discussion with the owner. My mom was the last to order, and upon receiving the change back from her purchase, the owner decided to rip into her. She explained once more, nastily, their policy of parties. My mom explained, once again, they were not a party. They were coworkers that were coming in for lunch. After this, while they were sitting at the table, the food for my mom was served first. She had to get a to go box because the service was so slow. She followed the owner back to the front to get a box, to which the owner decided she was hiring my mom without pay, and asked her to take the orders back to her coworkers. Strange thing to do when you're supposed to be the server. Couldn't even do her own job. I don't recommend this place to anyone. My own personal experience was not good there when it was like the world was over when I didn't want cashews on my sandwich and preferred peanuts instead. They really need to work on their hospitality skills.I met with a group of nerdy(bookish not loud) college students over the summer to review a team project. At 10 am, the place had no other customers. Of the 7 of us, 5 bought items. I bought three items which included food and a drink.As soon as we all sat in a side area, the staff member delivering our food explained that everyone must purchase or we all needed to leave. I was so embarrassed for the students who may not have expected the cost, since I was the one who had suggested we meet at the coffee shop. After the staff member left, I went to the counter. I explained why  we were meeting and that I could not order for the two people who had not ordered because I did not know their preference (I did not want to  embarrass them by asking) but I had purchased three items that I was sharing with the group and some of the other students had purchased two items. I asked if we could stay for at least half an hour . (We had just started outlining our who would be doing which part of the assignment.) I thought that she would see the logic and our situation. Instead, she explained that the owners could not afford to have people using the bathroom if they were not paying customers (the bathroom is not a locked, ask- for- the-key place--to their credit). I was told to make our meeting quick because two people had not purchased items. We had planned on staying for an hour, but because we felt rushed, we left with the project half-outlined. None of us used the bathroom. I have not been back since.

So I went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch. Which 99% of the time means real ingredients. I looked at the croissants and they looked unappetizing, the decription sounded good but the didnt look flakey or anything. Which was a sign of hydrogenated oil, for some reason it weighs croissants down and is not only worse for you than saturated fat it makes them taste like shit. I asked the woman if there was partially hydrogenated oil in any of the food or margairine which has trans fat. She went and get the 13 yr old baker. Who told me they dont make the icing which has partially hydrogenated oil. WTF!! why would I just go to the grocery store if I didnt care about the oil. I could get 7 unfresh pasteries for this price?The make there shit from a mix and have premade icing. That is literraly the dumbest thing I have heard of.  I am definetly sending them an email, because if they dont even make there food than there is actually no point.It's been a few months strong, but I am still in love with Pleaissant Croissant Patisserie!  How can you not be? The minute you walk in, you feel as if you are at a café in Paris!I now have had time to try the many items they offer, from flavored croissants, breakfast croissant sandwiches, salads, coffee, water, tea.Every single time, the croissants are soo light, buttery melt in your mouth good! I have worked my across most of the flavored one, though the Cherry Cream is my favorite all of them are so very delish!!So happy to have found this little bit of heaven!"Do you know on this one block you can buy croissants in five different places? There's one store called Bonjour Croissant. It makes me want to go to Paris and open up a store called Hello Toast."  ―  Fran LebowitzWoke up this morning to find some delicious croissants on the table and a mug of french-pressed Kona coffee all thanks to Mr. W.  This is how every morning should start off.  Being that it was a gorgeous Sunday morning, I sat down on the couch, dragged a throw blanket over my shoulders, ripped a croissant in half, and chewed on the most flaky and buttery croissant ever.  It was light, airy, and delicious.  I was lucky enough to grab a peanut butter filled one and had ended up splitting it with Mr. W.  Also to be tasted was a Bavarian cream filled croissant.P.croissants has been Mr. W.'s favorite place for croissants growing up, seeing that his childhood home is down the street.  I'm glad he's decided to share this treat spot with me.  I would love to come back and try some of their sandwiches!

Review Text :
While visiting Arizona I was driving down Baseline Road in Tempe and noticed a place called Tom's BBQ Chicago Style. What caught my eye in particular was the signage stating that they carried Chicago Style Italian Beef. The next time I went down Baseline road I made sure to stop by and give it a try.I walked in to find a small restaurant. After looking over the menu I noticed they did indeed serve Chicago style hot dogs, and being the hot dog critic I obviously had to try one. I also ordered an Italian Beef as they had a big sign in front and I figured it must be a specialty of theirs, after about a 10 minute wait my food was ready. We'll start with the Italian Beef. This Italian beef was bland, they had the soggy part right. The bread was right, it had the right texture and softness. The Italian Beef meat itself did not have the usual Italian Beef seasoning that I find in Chicagoland. I've had worse Italian Beef sandwiches, but for a place putting this at the top of their signage I would expect it to be better.The hot dog was even worse. This was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog. The poppy seed bun was the right type (not a given in Arizona), but there was about three hot dogs worth of mustard on this thing. There was way too much tomato and too thick, this caused tomato water to soak the bun causing the bun to become soggy. There was a thick and watery pickle slice that caused the bun to be even soggier. The relish was also applied too liberally, while it was the neon green style of relish typically found in Chicago the application was just a mess. There were two sport peppers about the length of the dog between the two of them. Then cucumber slices and practically no onion. The bun fell apart as I attempted to pick it up, this was just a total disaster of a hot dog and puts a bad name on Chicago style dogs.Overall Tom's BBQ was a big disappointment. Despite signs indicating "Chicago Style" all over the outside, the two Chicago style food items I had here were lousy. Perhaps their BBQ is better but if and when I return to Arizona I'll take my chances elsewhere. Two stars for Tom's.

Restaurant name  Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine

Review Text :
The quest continues on to Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine to find a decent dim sum spot in Vegas.  Chang's is a smaller venue compared to Orchids Garden over on W. Sahara.Arriving in the middle of the Saturday lunch rush, I was seated immediately, even without my party of four present.  The table set up was a bit awkward and I found myself rearranging the chairs and place settings before the rest of my dining companions arrived.The dim sum carts came rolling by and I do admit, they had a better selection than Orchids.  We immediately got the shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings.  We also ordered a few random dumplings in a more translucent type skin, similar to the shrimp dumpling skin.  The chicken in the black bean sauce was a bit drier than other places, and not as flavorful.  We tried mushroom on tofu that was tasty and had the beef rice noodle and shrimp rice noodle.  Both the BF and the cousin enjoyed their Soft Tofu, which was sweeter here than other places.I think we were impressed by their wider selection that we forgot to inquire about the elusive Shanghai dumplings or Shark Fin Dumpling Soup!  Next time for sure!I was craving some sweetness to close out my meal and had the Egg Custard Tarts.  They had three small tarts to an order and they just came out of the oven!  These were definitely yummy!  I would go back just for these!  They had the Pineapple Bun, but not the kind with Egg Custard inside.  Bummer.Service was okay.  Because the busboys are a bit overanxious to clear your table, they will consolidate your dishes for you. This is something I have always hated, unless it was necessary to do so.  I don't particularly enjoy watching the busboy bang the steamer against another steamer on your table so the lone pork dumpling will join the other lone shrimp dumpling just to have one less dish on the table.  I mean, for gawd's sake, are they short on dishes in the back?Overall, despite the lipstick mark found on the BF's water glass, I would give Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine a solid 3.5 stars.  They have a decent selection of dim sum choices, but could fair better on service and quality.  So far, they match up pretty competitively with Orchids for now.  But the search continues on to find a place that offers a wider selection and yummy tasty morsels of dim sum to satisfy this SF girl.Total bill: $40 and change, not including tip.Update! 10/26/07 - Recently hosted a dinner here for about 40 people in one of their private rooms.  There were some people that were really easy to work with and friendly, while there were a few others that could be a bit abrasive.Our menu:* Seafood Chowder soup - Pretty good. I have this soup a lot, but I never knew it went by this name.  Chunks of seafood and tofu in a thick broth.  * Peking Duck ($32) - The skin is separated on another plate so you can start using them with the twelve buns provided.  Then the duck meat comes along on a different plate.* Walnut Prawns ($13.95) - Jumbo shrimp with candied walnuts on a bed of broccoli.  Beautifully presented and eaten all up!* Mongolian Beef ($8.95) - Not a particular favorite of mine, but eaten up by my fellow diners.* Steamed Chicken, Country Style (half $11.95) - I like steamed chicken, but the chicken head can be a bit of a distraction for those who maybe shocked by it.  Light flavoring and with a little white pepper, yum!* Fish Filet with Blackbean Sauce ($9.95) - A fave by someone else, but it was okay for me.  I prefer my fish steamed instead of stir-fried.* Baked Pork Cutlet with Seasoned Salt ($9.95) - Tasty, but it looked like we got all the little bits while the other tables got the large pieces of pork.* Stringbean Szechuan Style ($8.95) - I prefer my stringbeans braised, or double fried.  This was pretty standard, nothing special.* Chang's Crispy Fried Noodle ($9.95) - HUGE order and loaded with veggies and seafood bits.  A good value for the money!Service wise - The food came too fast.  With so many orders coming out, our guests barely had a chance to make a dent into one dish before another dish would come.  There was never enough room on the table, and it would be nice if the waitstaff assisted with condensing the dishes onto smaller one (instead of just pouring them together).  They probably should work better as a team to make sure there is room on each lazy susan before coming out with each platter.  They were better at refilling water, tea, and rice pots in the beginning of the meal, but slacked off near the end.  They did bring us a knife to cut the cake (and offered to cut it for us too), extra napkins, to go boxes, etc.  Some polishing up on customer service overall could definitely use some improvement.  Overall, Chang's worked out well for our dinner party.  They were easy to work with in making our own menu and providing suggestions.  We also came early to decorate the room, which worked out well too.We were led to this place by our friend who is a local here. Morning dimsum on Saturday was a definitely fantastic idea, I have to say.The dimsum here was excellent. I am not that familiar with dimsum but man, every one of the dimsum we ordered was kickass good. I also wanted xiao long bao, and they had it on the menu, so we ordered it. The skin was a bit on the thicker side, but the bao itself was top notch. They also had egg tarts. Oh man, egg tarts. I lUV EGG TARTS!!!I wish I knew the names of the dimsum better. Guess my review isn't that useful after all, but I surely enjoyed their food =DThe dim sum here was hit or miss. I came came here with some family that were already in town right after I flew in. Some of the dim sum was 4 or 5 stars while most were really bland in taste. I've been here before and would have given it a 4 star review at my prior visits here. I was pretty disappointed overall with the food here the other day. Still, the dim sum here is pretty cheap though.We ordered the usual dim sum dishes which included a variety of dumplings, steamed dishes and fried goodies. We ordered quite a bit of food so I'm just going to highlight the goodies. The sticky rice dish, the steamed chicken paws, and a few of the fried goodies were all pretty good while everything else we ordered was mediocre at best.I might have to check out another dim sum place next time. This place isn't the go to place that I've always relied on it to be.every time i eat dim sum, two things are inevitable:1.  i always eat waaay too much 2.  i always wear a white shirt (not planned) and get splashes of soy sauce all over my shirt that ends up looking like ink blots on a rorschach test...run- on sentence...i know =)on my last trip, my friend and i ordered:siu maihttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=wjCjFIztbagVr9lHBQ0C5Qspare ribs with black bean saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=0MsGq9FNq0j8_DuU4mu_8gXLBhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=pcKfKHdWMaguiWGuQDuqrgsteamed bbq bunshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=5H8zdgaVzoRbIAw6EA_sOQsticky rice with shrimp and chinese sausagehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=A74GTaO1gsz24yRK3mttcgflat noodle with shrimphttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=4pxQ8iD5jGlfywsv-cWw5gsticky rice wrapped in lotus leafhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=ouW5rSHjWjJo-XKmp1bqRAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=tPsRoVF7rxbUFZKC-txU6wchive and shrimp dumplinghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=fZ9stiaNEPs-7ITysnN82Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=5Gy2f2LHSSG-vvqNM4zkGAfried smelthttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=d3Ry2bDDtXT5vtgw3mHjUwsmelt roehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=b0i870qndlOkZ3Qut0eLPQtofu pudding with carmelized ginger saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=Cxihey8np1zw_pmyufDfpQdim sum at chang's is consistently good...i love that they serve dim sum EVERYDAY...they even have fried smelt on a weekday...although we had to ask for it...also noticed they have a larger selection on the weekends, but gets really packed...i suggest going early to avoid the wait and crowds...parking can also be a painChang's will definitely be our go-to place for dim sum in Vegas!On a recent weekday visit, I was concerned that we may have arrived a bit too late for dim sum.  But I was wrong!  A little before 1 and there was still a stream of leisurely dim sum eaters enjoying their lunch and reading the newspaper.  (This was definitely a good sign since many of the customers were reading the Chinese language newspaper!)Most importantly, tea was brought out to us before the food came.  Nonetheless, the dim sum cart ladies were more than happy to surround us once we were seated.  I did ask for them to give us a moment as we were waiting for the rest of our party (in Cantonese) and they were more than happy to oblige in a polite manner.Among the offerings, this is what we got:* Shrimp Dumplings* Pork Dumplings* Shanghai Dumplings* Peanut and Chive Dumplings* Tofu Skin Roll* Steamed Tripe* Pork Spare Ribs* Beef Rice Noodle Roll* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce - The first few carts didn't have this, but they were sure to let the kitchen know it was requested.  And the best part, they brought it to our table first when it did come out.  And that's how a dim sum restaurant should work!Our favorite - Egg Custard Pineapple Bun!  It was so creamy good, delicious and piping hot!  Look out for the ladies holding it on a tray because that means it just came out of the oven and it's definitely not something you want to miss!  (The Husband and I were still thinking about them later on in the day!)Prices for dim sum are:Small, A group: $1.85Medium, B group: $2.50Large, C group: $3.75D group: $5E group: $6.75(Seven of the things we ordered was part of the B group, with three items being in the A group, and one item in the C group.)Sure, they can really invest in updating their sign outside since it's fading so bad.  And one dim sum cart lady was a bit pushy, in a humorous way, as she joked with me in my poor Cantonese.  But once I ordered a dish from her cart, she was gone.  Empty dishes were cleared in a quick manner, maybe still a bit too efficient but workable.And they do have hot chili oil!  They will automatically bring out hot chili sauce, but let them know you want the oil and out it will come!$36 for party of three, tip and tax includedUpdate! (05.12.10)I just went yesterday for dim sum and they were still pretty where we had to wait for a short while for our party of four.  They apparently ran out of hot chili oil!  Argh!  So, we were stuck with the regular hot chili sauce. Bleh.  $40 for a party of four, tip not included.Chang's of Las Vegas is an institution.  When the Chinatown region of Las Vegas was just developing, I remember having a meal at Chang's and being impressed by the quality.  Fast forward at least ten years later and I'm glad to see Chang's is still around (now with two branches) and that their quality is still up to par. The majority of diners go to Chang's for traditional Hong Kong style dim sum.  However, for our meal, we came for dinner and ordered a traditional Chinese banquet.  Having eaten in Hong Kong, Vancouver, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, I admit I wasn't expecting much.  But after dinner, I came away quite happy and thought the meal was a fantastic deal as well.Service was surprisingly good and it's a surprise this place was relatively quiet of patrons.  It may be off the strip, but I can guarantee the Chinese food is better than most offerings on the Strip and of much higher and authentic quality.  Two thumbs up.A sampling of our menu:Appetizer plate - a beautiful presentation of Chinese BBQ items like duck and goose, alongside sliced meat selections, jellyfish, shrimp and seaweed.  Everything was flavorful and really started the menu off right.Crab claws - Deep fried crab claws fresh out of the fryer were hot and delicious and was served alongside what looked like deep fried seaweed.  The waiter later informed us it was the top part of the gai lan Chinese vegetable deep fried and seasoned with salt.  Unique and delicious.  No one wanted the waiter to take it away.Shark Fin Soup - classic presentation with good flavor and plentiful pieces of Virginia ham and chicken to complement the fin.Peking Duck - a whole prepared duck was brought out, skinned, and served to each patron in a bun.  They then sliced the excellent duck meat and served that as a platter as well.Braised Abalone with Chinese Vegetables - the abalone was not the least bit overdone and the vegetables were top notchSteamed fish - I believe a whole rock cod was prepared steamed with ginger and soy sauce.  Live and fresh.Wok fried lobster - a large lobster cut into pieces and sauteed with ginger and scallions.E-fu noodles - a wonderful side dish alongside the fried rice.Fried rice - standard fried riceOverall, we were extremely pleased with Chang's.  Service was polite and fast, entrees were delicious and plentiful, and prices were very competitive.  We all left with more leftovers than we knew what to do with and everyone had plenty of their favorite dishes.Next time you're in Vegas craving authentic Chinese food, you deserve to give this place (or it's sister branch) a try.  Chang's accepts credit cards, including American Express.Things have changed since my last review of Chang's, so it looks like another update is necessary!First off - the sign out front!  Yay, they got rid of that faded old sign advertising Chang's.  Although I'm not particularly fond of their tacky new font, at least it's legible! Looks like prices have gone up too!Group A - $2Group B - $2.75Group C - $3.95 Group D - $5.95Group E - $7.95For our hungry party of three, we had five items from Group A, seven items from Group B, and one item from Group C.They included:* Shrimp Dumplings* Pork Dumplings* Beef Ball* Tofu Skin Roll* Steamed Tripe* Beef Rice Noodle Roll* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce * Deep Fried Ground Pork Dumpling* Deep Fried Taro and Ground Pork Dumpling* Shanghai Dumplings (Group C) - It's something they don't push around in the carts.  You have to put in a special order for it.  Our order was had four dumplings, but you can request eight.  It came out piping hot - just the way it's supposed to be.  Be careful with the soup inside because it burned my tongue! The whole point of going out for dim sum is to "yum cha" which means to drink tea. Therefore, tea charges is as follows:* Tea is $.50/person* Chrysanthemum tea is $1/per personI wanted to end our lunch with something sweet and looked over the Egg Custard Tarts.  They appeared to be the same ones that were out when we first arrived, so I passed on that.  We also skipped on the Egg Custard Pineapple Bun this time around since we didn't see them come out fresh, and these buns needed to be eaten piping hot only!  They did offer the dessert tofu dish, but that's not my favorite.  Perhaps they need a better sweet selection or at least a higher turnover on it so things can still come out fresh! The service was surprisingly attentive on a Monday and there was no wait.  Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly refilled without us asking, which we really appreciated.  A large bus group did arrive shortly after us and did take up some of the attention, but it was understandable.Unfortunately, they do not have hot chili oil anymore, just the regular hot chili sauce.  I'll continue to ask for it in case they bring it back!3.5 starsService is non-existent, rude if any and racially discriminatory. Basically if you do not look Chinese or are not Chinese the people who work here are extremely rude.My husband (1/2 Chinese 1/2 Swedish) and I (100% Chinese) came here with our son (1 year old) for an early dim sum lunch. We have been coming to Chang's since 2004 but the restaurant is now under new ownership. We experienced the WORST, actually it was NON EXISTENT service. The hostess was rude when she seated us. She brought over 2 forks, ignored me when I said we do not need them and then slammed them onto our plates and walked away.When we complained to the manager he told us the restaurant workers bring forks to Americans. This in itself is racial discrimination/profiling, seriously who doesn't know how to use chop sticks?!?!? Do Japanese restaurants bring "Americans" forks? Do Italian restaurants bring Asian customers chop sticks? When it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seated us point blank ignored our raised bill in the air and purposely did not take it. At this point my husband walked over to her and tapped her on the back to give her the bill. She continued to ignore him and refused to turn around. He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.When we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back. Uuuuummm really? How else am I supposed to get a workers attention so they can DO THEIR JOB? Instead of being apologetic or recognizing the blatant discrimination the owner and the manager of the restaurant blamed us the customers for being a problem. I will never come to this restaurant again and believe what comes around goes around. The food is mediocre at best and the service does not exist. We are from San Francisco and have never been treated in such a manner at any Chinese or Asian restaurant.I've eaten plenty of dim sum in my life and this place fell so short of my expectations. It was a Sunday morning and they has just opened up. Ha gow were tiny and skimpy on the shrimp. The dim sum tasted like leftovers from the day before and wasn't fresh. Besides the disappointing quality - there was a very small selection to choose from for a Sunday. The service was so so and the prices were high for the quality of food received.I wouldn't even think about coming back here in the future.We were all in the mood for Dim Sum and decided to come to Chang's cause I've been here a bunch of times and it's always been good. Parking was easy as it wasn't busy, usually it's packed and I'll tell you why in a sec. It's on Decatur just north of Tropciana. Not far behind the Home Depot. The only reason I've giving this place 1 star is cause of the shitty customer service. Their website clearly states they do Dim Sum till 10:30pm. We came in and sat down looked over the menu for about 15 minutes while we drank our tea. We tell our server were going to do Dim Sum and he says no dim sum today because the cook left early. WTF!? That is the only reason why we came here and thier website says they serve it till 10:30pm!What's worse is they didn't tell us when we came in we sat there wasting our time. It crappie when this is what your known for and you don't have it. When I told the server about it and what their website says he looked at me like I was from Pluto. Won't be coming back for awhile, was quite disturbed.

Review Text :
I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. In my opinion, the Chinese restaurant lunch special is one of the best deals around. Why? Because for the same price or even less than a fast food chain, the Chinese lunch special usually includes a delicious entre with soup, fried rice, and sometimes an egg roll. Additionally, the Chinese restaurant lunch special is a chance to become acquainted with a Chinese Restaurant. If the food is delicious at a reasonable price for the lunch special, then the restaurant could be a great place for dinner or a date. Recently, the lunch special reacquainted me with the Lotus, when I took advantage of their lunch special twice recently.      The Lotus sits in the heart of historic Henderson in the Water Street District. It is diagonally across from the Eldorado Casino and City Hall. There is a small parking lot adjacent to the venerable building that houses the Lotus. On my visits, I parked in the Eldorado parking lot, cut through the casino and walked the short distance along Water Street to the Lotus.     The Lotus lunch special differentiates from several lunch specials on account of the fact that it ends at 3 PM in lieu of 4 PM. Additionally, the Lotus is one of the few Chinese restaurants that I am aware of where the lunch special includes wonton soup.    The inside of the Lotus is grander than it appears from Water Street. There are two dining rooms. Both times I  recently visited, there were relatively few people dining inside. Both times the host turned waitress invited me to sit in the dining room to the right. The ambiance is more casual and relaxing than a take out with a few seats.    On the two visits, I ordered a different lunch special combination for $5.95. On my first visit, I ordered the beef chow mein soft noodle style. It came with fried rice, an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce, and wonton soup. The beef chow mein was far better than what China Go Go and some other restaurants use as filler with the entrée. It was far better than a handful of fast food restaurants. On my second visit, I ordered the pepper steak that included the exact sides. The pepper steak was delicious at the same time that it had a unique taste that my taste buds would consider brisket. The wonton soup that came with the meal, complimented the meal. I wish more Chinese restaurants would offer wonton soup instead of the standard soup of the day that is usually egg drop or hot and sour soup. On visit one I complimented the beef chow mein with a Coke and on visit two I complimented the pepper steak with hot tea. With the beverage, tax, and tip; the lunch special totalled out at less than $10.   The waitress was friendly. I felt more like a guest in a person's living room with a sundry of tables than a diner in a restaurant. My favorite Chinese restaurants are the cozy places where I mentally feel that I am in a living room. Throughout the lunch special, she'd see to it that everything was good. Both times, she'd conclude my visits by saying she hopes I return soon. With a reasonable price for lunch specials that gives you a lot for the same or less price of a fast food chain in addition to good service in a cozy environment it us a possibility that I will return to the Lotus soon.

This is some of the Best Vietnamese Food the valley. Nice little Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant in a tiny strip mall in Tempe. You will always see the same friendly family members there providing great tasty food and service. Inside is clean and cozy but simple. Gets busy really quick at lunch. On many of my visits there for lunch I see our hard working local law enforcement and fire fighters taking a break and enjoying a quick meal before they get back to work. Some of the tables are round and ready for a large group.I love the Pho there. It is so much better than some of the others in town and is packed with flavor. It comes with a plate of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and some lime wedges. The table also has all the condiments you may want such as schricha, housin sauce, fish sauce, etc. The Glass and Egg Noodle Soups are fantastic as well. Try the Bun which is very tasty and is an Angle Hair Noodle dish with the meats of you choice topped with scallions, peanuts, fried shallots and served over chopped red lettuce, herbs, cucumbers, sprouts and yummy fish sauce. One of my favorites is a specialty dish call Pho Ap Chao and is a plate of fried Crispy Rice Noodle Cake with Shrimp, Crab, Beef and all sorts of Veggies covered in a delicious light brown garlic sauce. So good.Everything is great here and they have too many dishes to explain them all. They also serve a large selection of Chinese food for those who are not in the mood for something different. Simply Outstanding!Here's my scaling system on how this place received 2 stars from me:  I came here with 3 of my co-workers for lunch, thankfully we were seated right away because this place was packed (+5 star). There was only one server, so we waited and waited and waited about 10 minutes before he finally came over to take our order, after he took the order of two other tables that came in after us (-1 star).  I initially wanted to order ban cuon dac biet #25, but the server told me "No, we're too busy, I'm not making that" REALLY??!!??! Isn't this a restaurant? Aren't you in business hoping to have a full house every day?  The item is on the !*&$*# menu!  Tell me you're out of it or something, not "we're too busy..." (-2 star, YES I deducted 2 stars for this).   I settled with #19 - Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong.  Two of my co-workers ordered basically the same dish I had, but added shrimp to theirs and one ordered the #1-pho.  They all enjoyed their food (+1 star).  I've had better, the grilled pork was thinly sliced and a bit overcooked, so it was kind of tough to chew (-1 star).

Restaurant name  Coo Coo's Gourmet Coffee Cafe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
You gotta love these locally owned cafes.  I sure do, especially when it's in Old Henderson. With a ton of coffee shops that boomed in the last 10 years like Starbucks and Coffee Bean, it's a breath of fresh air to see one of these older cafes still around.  Coo Coo's is definitely one of those hidden gems in the area.  Known for smoothies, coffee, deserts, and sandwiches.  It's actually their boba, that I came in for.  I was in the area and met up with T-Elite for a quick boba fix.  To be honest, I needed to break that "2:30 feeling". I had their Almond Smoothie w/Boba to do exactly that.  This treat was creamy and tasted exactly like almonds.  Imagine the initial taste of an Almond Roca.  Now imagine the taste and feel of boba immediately after that Almond Roca taste.  Well, that's exactly what you get here. Simply delicious!!There is a wide selection of different sandwiches that you can get here.  Coo Coo's is small and can house a couple of groups inside, but there's also seating outside.  I say take advantage when the weather is good and eat outside. I'm in this area at least once a month usually for work, the Henderson Police Department, and to visit both Wonder Twins (aka Alicia R and Terri R).  When in the area and if I'm in the mood for boba, I know Coo Coo's will be there to satisfy my cravings.I've been a customer of Coo Coo's for years--literally.  I started working in Henderson in 1997 (I'm old) and ever since then, Paul and his crew have been serving up good food and great service.  Most of the City employees eat at Coo Coo's or have food delivered, from lattes to Funky Monkeys to bagels and sandwiches.  The restaurant is on the small side, but there's outside seating and I know when it's too busy to eat there.  I usually show up around 11:30am if I'm going to dine-in and order online first so Paul knows we're coming.  He'll reserve a booth for us so we have somewhere to sit.  My regular order is the Ocean Spray sandwich (turkey w/ cranberry dressing) or the Veggie Delight sandwich (alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers).  Coo Coo's also started serving boba drinks a few years back and I get my fix almost every other week.  Coo Coo's is a downtown Henderson institution and I appreciate all the years of food and friendly service Paul and his staff have served up.  We've gotten to know each other over all these years and I'm sure I'm not the only one--it's like Cheers without the alcohol.  Thanks for all you do, Coo Coo's--let's stay together.It's like walking into the past, but it's in the present?...Ouch my brain. Imagine you're Marty McFly and you just got zapped back to 1955; well that's the vibe this place has as soon as you walk in. Black and white checkerboard floors, red leather bound booths and chairs with multiple old school movie posters on the walls. "This is getting heavy doc."This place is very tiny with only two booths and a few chairs, so you better not come here during the lunch rush or you're eating in your car. If you're on the run and need a bite, Coo Coo Cafe does offer phone-in orders that you can pick-up on the way to you're next appointment or if you wan to eat at home while you enjoy reruns on TV. "What's a rerun?"With plenty of parking outside, I pulled up, walked in and met the owner, who by the way also takes your food order. This dude has a salty demeanor, but I can tell he's the "big soft teddy bear" type. No messing around though, just order your food and sit down...cool with me I'm starving! I went with what he said was the, "local favorite" the Cali Sub w/ sprouts, avocado, turkey, bacon and swiss cheese. On paper this sounds pretty basic, but it was very fresh and piled high (see photo) with lots of goodies, plus the bread was super soft. Plush in the middle and toasted on top by a sandwich press. Let's be real, the bread can make or break a good sammie, right?!?! "That's right butt head"To wash it all down I ordered the "Kiwi Kooler" smoothie. This had a great presentation, but was a little on the sweet side for my taste so I only drank about half. All-in-all this place was a hit for me and my tastebuds. "Great Scott!"I will be coming back to check out other Coo Coo Cafe food options from their simple, but surprising menu. "Now, let's get back...to the future!"My tip best summarizes why am a fan of Coo Coo's Cafe:     " The best scrambled eggs that I've had in a restaurant the past decade; or come to think of it ever."    Coo Coo's is an appropriate name. You can say that I am coo coo for their scrambled eggs. Maybe with the exception of my grandfather's scrambled eggs, Coo Coo's is hitherto now the champion of scrambled eggs (in my opinion ). The two breakfasts that Coo Coo's served me this year featured scrambled eggs. I ordered the Hearty breakfast plate ($6.99) one visit and the smaller Petite breakfast plate ($5.39) the other visit. For $6.99 the Hearty breakfast plate with a coffee costing an additional  $1.95 is a grand deal. The Hearty Breakfast Plate includes three scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese. Coo Coo's Cafe made me aware that cheddar cheese with scrambled eggs is a winning combination. The cheddar cheese was equally as tasty as the scrambled eggs. I'd choose six slices of Apple Wood smoked bacon over two thick cut slices of ham or two sausage patties. I wasn't coo coo over the bacon. They were good. However, I have tasted better bacon. I'd choose sordough over wheat toast. In my opinion toast is toast. Being adventurous I tried grits. My memory has zero recollection of ever trying grits before I had breakfast in Coo Coos. When the food is good, it is a good time to try something new because you will be experiencing a quality portion of the food. Complimenting the food was quality Illy coffee.    When I stopped into Coo Coo's for breakfast, I left the fast-paced surface streets of Henderson to step back in time. It reminds me of a diner off US 66. The US 66 diner theme fits in with the Historic Water Street (downtown Henderson) District that is along the Boulder Highway corridor between the Freemont Street Experience and Hoover Dam. I could picture a Hoover Dam worker driving his Model T from Fremont Street on the way to working at the Hoover Dam site. In 2015, Coo Coo's Cafe with a walk along historic Water Street is a nice breakfast choice before the Clark County Museum or Lake Mead. Just pass over this suggestion on Sundays because Coo Coo's is closed.   The Water Street Historic District is more than the home of downtown Henderson. It is also the home of a small cafe serving first-rate scrambled eggs. This is my 4 star scramble endorsement of Coo Coo's cafe.

Review Text :
Make Great Success, The Pizza By Napoli Way!1. Find a major road (in this case Thunderbird) and set up shop at the nearest available crossroads. Don't worry about location, though. Given the size of Phoenix, the chances that you'll be a five-minute drive from AT LEAST THREE other dine-in pizza places is pretty low.2. Decorate the place once, and leave it. In the pizza game, you can never look too "vintage".3. The one or two guys with the heaviest accents? Put them on the register. You want to look authentic.4. Don't waste time worrying about a "diverse menu". Just serve the same pizza and wings as your competition. People don't eat pizza for the taste, they eat it for nostalgia, and with that decades-old decor and Old World accents, NOBODY will be more nostalgic than you, baby!5. Charge extra for everything. Soda refills. Ranch cups. When they gotta pay fifty cents more for it, it tastes better. It's science. 6. Since you're right by ASU West, why don't you offer a lunch special for all of those hungry students? Hey now, don't get ahead of yourself. Just offer two slices of your most generic (in this case, cheese) pie at a "reduced" price. If you make the slices light enough, they'll spring for a third or some wings. After eating Aramark food the other four days a week, college students will pay stupid coin for "authentic" pizza with a quirky "retro" feel. 7. Don't tell anyone that you're actually from Albania, and not Sicily. You'll lose your street cred.8. Uh...we thought we could stretch this out to 10 but that's really all you need. Oh, if you want you can set up an arcade machine (preferably one of a, yup, you guessed it, a 2D fighter...see? You're getting where we're coming from) in the corner just in case they don't want to spend their fifty cents to refill their mountain dew. You'll get those bastards one way or another.9...Very nice!?

I'm on my way from Buckeye, AZ to Tucson and I forgot to fill the tank before leaving Buckeye, whoops.    I'm driving down the 85 toward Hwy 8 and am looking for an exit with both gas station at a reasonable price and a few fast food choices so I can grab some grub for the road at the same time.    I see multiple options and exit.I pass a few other stations and pull into this Texaco station.   I whip out my phone and the Yelp app, find this business and check in.    Whoa, what's this??   SURPRISE SURPRISE... it's telling me get 10 cents off PER GALLON with check in, YOWZER!!!!    This is the best check in offer I've ever gotten, YAY! I walk in and show my phone with the check in offer and sure enough when I get back to the pump, the price has dropped from $3.25 to $3.15 a gallon, SCHWEET!This is an interesting station, in that, it's a gas station with the usual mini-mart, but they also sell ornamental yard art, decorative water fountains, benches etc.   I'm glad I chose to stop at this station rather than the others right next to the off ramp!

Review Text :
First off this is not a Mexican food place. I overheard a customer trying to compare and it's not the same. The food at Mi Cocina Mi Pais is  South American  with most entrees being Ecuadorian . The owner is Ecuadorian but realized many dishes from Columbia, Argentina and Peru were similar. In fact we talked to the gal next to us who is Colombian and was so excited to find food from home. The food was very delicious and we  are planning on going back and trying other dishes. I loved my fish in Banana Leaves  lots of orange, yellow and red peppers with a light white fish.  Tasty with a side of white rice and   bananas  fried  like chips. My hubby ordered carne asada  Argentina style , very spicy which he adores.  He also had chunky fried plantains . Everything was great. The place is small but the Host/ waiter / Owner's Son did a great job serving the 4 groups of people . The decor is bright and it's obvious they have a passion for what they do. This place is sandwiched in a small place in a strip mall but don't let that throw you off stop by and give it a try for something deliciously different.My kitchen, my country, my oh my what a great little offbeat restaurant this is.  Amidst a dying strip mall area on Bell Rd in northwest Phoenix you'll find an authentic Ecuadorian/SouthAmerican place that has food that will make you want to go back for more,.It's a family run ethnic restaurant that's very small and quaint.  Not hard to drive by, or not see it from the road as a Taco Bell is directly in front of it.  I really don't know why people would go to T-Bell anyway with Mi Cocina a few feet away.  I guess some people don't know better.The menu has many  different choices to choose from and if you have any questions ask the server/owner's son and he'll gladly help.  I'm a fan of the tamales, pork empandas, and shrimp ceviche.  Oh and I forgot the dessert.  As you're dining there the desset case is just over an arms length away screaming at you every minute.  I'm not a sweets person and even I gave in and tried some delightful indulgence.This is one of the best "finds" to be found in the Phoenix metro area!The world has finally presented me with an easy choice.  After years of wandering through life, decisions half-made or made wholly wrong, a simple and easy direction has shown itself to me: I have to move to Ecuador.Quite honestly, if the food here is representative of the native regional cuisine, I'm just going to buy a ticket, pack my cat, and head down there.  Feel free to pick over my belongings.Almost completely hidden from view, this tiny hole in the wall of a restaurant sits, waiting for those looking to find it.  The decor is bright and charming; inviting without feeling like it's trying to be ethnic.  The tables are comfortable and huge.  I had actually thought they were a bit over sized when we first sat down but, well, then food started to arrive.We were started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  And while they may not have been much to look at, these slightly greasy chips and sweetly spicy salsa are very tasty.  This little appetizer was soon followed by a plate of empanadas and a sampler of their tamales.  Now, I love tamales, so I was probably looking forward to this most of all.  These three (a Mexican red, a green, and an Ecuadorian) were not only beautifully crafted and presented, but they were some of the best quality I'd ever eaten.  If it's your first time here and you like tamales, don't pass that sampler up.  The red might not have been the most stunning, but the green is the perfect blend of cheese, pepper, and corn.  The Ecuadorian tamale was just unlike any tamale I've tried before.  Wrapped in a banana leaf, there was just more filling to it than I'd ever seen in your standard tamale.The main dishes followed in good time.  Again, the presentation on this food is just stunning.  If I had ever dreamed about being a food photographer, I'd probably start my portfolio here.  The brisket I had ordered was covered in what I can only term as a "salsa" of peppers and various other vegetables.  Combined with the meat that was tender enough to cut with a fork and the avocado slices, it was just a sublime meal.  A combination of flavors that I had honestly never experienced before.I've had (I think) real Mexican, Spanish, and a variety of other types of food.  The cuisine here is distinctly in it's own category.  I think that's what draws me back to it most: a delightfully inviting, yet wholly unknown, palate to explore.Loved it! Unique Ecuadorian/Peruvian/South American food with good flavors, excellent presentation and a good variety.The vegetarian plate comes with veggie flan doused with cheese sauce, grilled plantains, a mound of rice, lentils in a tasty sauce and a fried egg over easy, cooked oh so right.For those of you who aren't in the know, mash down the rice mound, salt it up, then throw the fried egg on top. Chop it up and feast! I love me some fried eggs & rice and they make the ingredients perfect here.If you're looking for some unique flavors & food combinations that are sure to impress, check this place out!Mi Comida is a new name for an old favorite.~Mi Cocina Mi Pais hasn't changed their staff or ownership, just their name.~I guess it was too hard for gringos to pronounce.Well, ¿Qué te hace pensar que este güero no sabe la buena comida?A brightly colored, spotlessly clean, and intricately decorated interior make you feel festive and also homey at the same time, as soon as you walk in from the strip mall, Taco Bell drive-thru-facing exterior.A friendly greeting, a bit of menu consultation, and a basket of chips with a spicy but perfectly balanced salsa was soon in front of me.My sandwich was piled high with thick, moist slabs of roasted, marinated pork that had the most savory flavor.  It came with a delightfully tangy dish of julienned red onions, pickled in vinegar, on the side.  I used up all of those yummy fuscia onion slivers on my sandwich de puerca; after a tiny sample, however, I left the pico-like salsa fresca alone -- too much heat for this nortero -- but it was a cornucopia of color and texture and flavors!¿Qué te hace pensar que este güero no sabe la buena comida?I have been putting off this review for a long time.Frankly. It has been intimidating to write. I want so badly to appropriately convey just how special this little restaurant is. I suppose there is no other way than to spill out all my blinding earnestness in one fell swoop, casually extolling every virtue this little mom n' pop restaurant offers."Mi Comida", formerly "mi Cocina mi Pais", is hands down, my favorite restuarant in all of the valley. Located  in the most unassuming strip mall, shadowed neath the coporate monster that is taco bell. Mi Comida is a south american restaurant, offering Peruvian, Colombian, and Ecuadorian dishes- of such quality and sagacious cooking method, you'll feel as if your very own south american grandmother you never knew you had cooked it all for you. The food is so good in fact i'd subsitute it for human relationships any day; this leaves you and your wallet: satisfied, happy, and full. I couldn't tell you what my favorite dish is, probably the entire menu. Every time i come here it is an adventure. Will it be closed? Will it be jam packed w/ adoring fawning salivating foodies? What will i order this time?Seriously i have ordered a different item each time, and NEVER, repeat NEVER was i disappointed. I have brought my parents here, my brother, my sister, my best friends, and even my ex girlfriend, and all entered a little skeptical and cautious, but left adoring fans. I'm not sure if it is possible to describe accurately how much i love this restaurant; and for the life of me i dont understand why the rating isnt a complete 5 *****! i'd like to sit down and chat w/ some of my Yelp friends and open a real dialogue as to why they only gave it 4 stars....i'm lookin at you Iain B.! lolWhether you live in Chandler, or Tukee. Mesa or PV make the drive out here (not you sun city folk you'll kill someone on the way)! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!If your blink twice while looking for Mi Comida Resaurante Latino on Bell and 43rd Ave you'll miss it!!  This place is small and not very appealing on the outside.  But it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception.  What an awesome little "Ecuadorian Gem" of a place this is!  Mi Comida reminds us of some of the best Peruvian, Argentina and Columbian restaurants we used to go to in Miami but without all of the flair and the high prices. This is truly a mom and pop, locally owned restaurant serving up delicious South American dishes.  This place is very small and quaint with some personality. They do fill up during lunch and dinner, so you may want to come early to get seated right away.  I was excited to see they serve several traditional South American dishes and delicacies which are somewhat similar to but also very different than traditional Mexican food.  I was excited to try their shrimp and fish ceviche served the same way we get it in our favorite Argentina/Columbian restaurant in Miami, which is in a large goblet, tons of flavor and spice, enough to serve two.  It was fantastic!  We had to try their tamales which are a little different than the traditional Mexican tamales.  I recommend getting their Tamales Sampler which consists of a red shredded beef tamale which was excellente' ~ wound up ordering a couple to go, a white green chili with queso tamale, also excellente' and their Ecuadorian tamale which had pork, tomato, carrots and cheesy goodness wrapped in a banana leaf.  This tamale is worth making a second trip back on the same day ~ lunch and dinner!   My friend had their Seco de Pollo ~ chicken stew which was a wonderful dish and a chicken empandas for an app.  She loved it.  Friend #2 had their shrimp stew for an app and their Bandela Paisa with chorizo, carne asada, plantains, rice and other goodies.  The carne asada was tender and delicious with just the right amount of heat and sauce.  It too was excellente'.  Their menu offers several options so don't be afraid to ask the server about the dish before ordering.  Try their empandas, tamales or ceviche as an app or pick several different ones as a meal.  You can't go wrong here!  You will leave satisfied, happy and already to planning what to eat on your next visit.I'm always a little cautious when I read reviews from people I don't know that state things like "this is the most authentic food..." especially when it's ethnic food and the writer is whiter than me.  Who knows, these writers may be from Ecuador and somewhere in South America, but what I do know is the food at Mi Comida Resaurante Latino taste as good as or better than some of the best South American restaurants I've been to.  They keep it simple with tons of flavor and lots of love! I hope to see you there.Real Deal great food here. I have held off on my reviews as I only have been there 2 times. The first time I tried what you would call a sampler platter. It had a little bit of everything. I scarfed it down and was wanting more! The second time was for lunch. I had an Empanada trio. Each one was so unique and flavorful I wanted more again. The staff is great, friendly and willing to talk for a bit if not too busy. This is a N Phx treasure for sure.Mi Comida is EXCELLENT.  I've been a dozen times or so (used to be called Mi Cocina Mi Pais, which means my kitchen my country).The food is 5 stars but be ready to explore when you get there.  Not much is typical about the menu.  Even the beers are not what you normally see.  There are 3 different types of ceviche.  The one with white fish is the star bur all are great.You must, MUST, get the Ecuadorian tamale.  It is wrapped in a banana leaf and just to die for.  They are darn big and run about $2.50.My wife almost always gets the chicken stew.  So simple and so yummy.  I have a hard time staying away from the Bandera.  It is a Colombian collection of rice, sausage, fried egg, plantains, beef and an arapa (a little cake of masa).  Yikes is it good.The fish wrapped in a banana leaf is also wonderful.  Every dish on the menu is a star.  I'd recommend you stay away from the empanadas and traditional Mexican style tamales.  Not because they are bad, but only because there are other much more defined stand outs on the menu.There are only 5 tables inside and it is located in a strip mall behind a Taco Bell.  Don't be fooled by the location.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry.  You must relax and enjoy.  Only one person cooks and only one person serves.The Chef/Cook/Owners husband or son will be your waiter.  The husband is hard to understand but it just adds to the charm.  The son is soft spoken and great.  The chef is classically trained and worked at the Four Seasons for many years before she started this restaurant making the food she loves and grew up with. Mi Comida is a special place.This is the MOST AMAZING PLACE EVER!!!!***** I feel in love with this small restaurant as soon as we walked in!!!THE OWNER Carlos is FANTASTIC and the food was the best Latin food I have had in my short lived life so far!!! It is simply GREAT, AMAZING, AWESOME, a MUST TRY!! **I had the Encocados de Camaron, it is shrimp in a milky coconut curry sauce with white rice, along with little plantain chips on the side, Mmm GOOD!! ** My best bud Shashi got their Carne Asada plate, which included a spicy, juicy carne asada steak with lentils and white rice!! I also tasted this and it was AMAZING!!!***Great place you MUST GO TRY, it was far from my home, but well worth the drive and wait on our plates, since it is all freshly made from scratch.** I also took 2 of the Guayaba cheese filled empanadas to go for my mom and dad!!THE WERE ALSO AMAZING, I had a bite or two!! :)THIS Little restaurant is my best friends favorite... and I don't blame him, this place is great!!! The food is oh so amazingly fresh and full of taste buds satisfying sensations to your mouth!!!_ Carlos, the owner is fantastic!! :)  Small place, but great food and great service!! :) Give it a try if you haven't yet!! The service wait time was moderate, considering it's own and operated by the owner and a small kitchen staff, the wait time then is understandable!!  MY MOST FAVORITE THING FROM THIS PLACE IS the must try ENCOCADOS DE CAMARON, AND the also wonderful GUANABANA SHAKE!!! OH SOOO GREAT!!!I loved this place so much that I started writing the review at the restaurant before I left!  The food here is delicious.  I tried 2 entrees.  Why not order lunch for tomorrow.  Haha.I had a fish dish and my all time favorite, bandeja paisa, actually a Columbian dish.  Both were delicious.  My dish was Everything I remembered about Bandeja Paisa.  Beans seasoned to perfection.  Steak marinated just right.  Even the plain white rice rated better than any plain white rice I've had.  It was cooked just salty enough and just fluffy enough.  Perfect!Don't come here expecting the traditional restaurant. This place is small.  I counted... There were exactly 6 tables that seat 4 people.  That's 24 seats!  don't go there if you are in a rush!  The food is cooked to order.  Home cooked food takes time.  The gentleman, Carlos, that waited on me seemed like he took his time because they understand it takes time to make good food.I even found that the folks in the restaurant were extremely friendly.  There was a regular customer there that day that kept me entertained the entire time I was there.  Keep in mind, this is a small establishment and it is not fast food, just amazing food.With out a doubt this is among the best places in the area to dine and it happens to be a little Ecuadorian Cafe. This place is tiny maybe only five tables and the only server is the chef's husband. I've been here many times before but I came very often and burnt myself out ordering the same few things so I decided to start fresh and try new things.They offer many ceviches including an interesting vegetarian variety made with Lupini Beans. I decided to try the Ecuadorian Style Ceviche. We were warned by the server it was very spicy and it was very spicy. It was fresh Cod in lime juice with tomatoes and pickled red onions. This was a very bold dish. They gave us dishes with spoons to eat it but I was getting too much lime and it would have been better with a fork. The pop corn sort of balanced your mouth from all the flavors in this dish. I thought it was a very generous serving.I really liked the grilled trout because it was seasoned just so and seemed to have a tasty wood fired taste on it. The fish wasn't perfect as the texture was a little off and ever so slightly over cooked but still very delicious. The salad that came with it was made with high end greens and had a tongue pleasing sweet mustard vinaigrette taste to it. I had my choice of side and picked rice. It was fresh and tasted buttered.I don't remember what my husband's plate was called but I think of it as a man plate sampler. It was tasty tender steak and beans, sausage, crispy pork skin, an egg, avocado, plantains two ways, rice, an arepa and a relish. It cost very little to dine here as my trout dinner was only $10.95 the value for certain is five stars.Mi Comida was the place picked for the International Supper Club UYE for September and I for one was excited to try them out!As others have stated this place is small, and if you are in a hurry, then skip it all together.  With that being said, we all arrived around the same time, and Carlos, who I guess is the owner, waited on us, and I have to say Carlos was amazing, gave us all personal attention, took each person's order one at a time and yes the dishes came out that way as well. But I have to say this was one of the best dinning experiences I have had in a very long time. I enjoyed the fact that we were not rushed and that we all were able to carry on a conversation and enjoy some great food! So if you are not in a hurry and are looking for great personal service, this is your place!I knew before I got there I wanted tamales! I have been craving tamales, but I didn't want the normal run of the mill tamales!  I ordered Tamale de papa, which on the menu said its made in the highlands of Ecuador, it was made with a potato cheese dough (hello this Irish girl loves potatoes!!) and it was filled with chicken, veggies and a slice of chorizo wrapped in a banana leaf, it was pretty darn tasty! Really enjoyed it!I also ordered the Pastel Crillo De Pollo - chicken, veggies and aji chilli wrapped inside a pastry puff, this too was delish!!    I crave/love spicy foods, and Carlos brought out some aji sauce and said that it was spicy, for me, it was lacking the heat, but made up for the amazing flavor it had. That stuff is delish! Impeccable service, excellent food, amazing company, hope to be back soon!Went here for the International UYE.  I have been meaning to try this place since before I was a Yelper. Glad I got the chance.  All of us knew there was one waiter and one cook in a tiny kitchen in advance so having the food come out as it was ready for each of us was not a problem and all of the dishes seemed properly done.  I wish more large groups and small restaurants would accept that as normal practice. As with any restaurant there were some items that were misses based on expectations.  Overall most of us liked what we had.  The owner ran the front of the house well while his wife/ co owner did all the cooking.  It was a very pleasant evening and the pace allowed us do quite a bit of chatting without feeling rushed.  There were also several good sized to go orders picked up while we were there.  I got the impression that they were not phoned in as it seemed folks stood around a bit waiting for their orders.We we're excited to try this place and so finally get to try it today. I've been looking at their menu since last week. The place was empty when we got there and it is a small restaurant.. Few tables, probably a total of 25 people can fit in there. So I ordered the sampler platter tamales (it has green, red & Ecuadorian tamales) and the Encocado de Camaron (shrimp with coconut milk). My classmates ordered Ecuadorian ceviche, Arepa con Queso (Arepa with cheese), Sango de Camaron (Shrimp w/ green plantain puree) and the Churrasco Ecuadorian (Angus beef steak). It took about 20mins wait for our appetizer and 15mins for the rest of our food. I totally understand, it says in the menu that everything is cook to order.The Ecuadorian tamale was good, it was wrapped with banana leaf and it was very moist, it has a different texture than the regular tamales, it's smoother. The red tamale was alright, it was a little bit dry. My favorite was the green tamale, it was moist and it's got cheese in the middle. The shrimp with coconut milk was very delicious, it was creamy and the shrimps were big and juicy.. I ate it with the white rice. I also get to try a little bit of everything and a sip of my classmate's green tea smoothie. I will come back for more shrimp w/ coconut milk, green tamales and the green tea smoothie!

Received a coupon in the mail for a BOGO Beef & Cheddar Sandwich....so I dropped by this location to grab a bite.  I was starving when I arrived, so I over-ordered.  In addition to my 2 Beef & Cheddars, I ordered a Roast Chicken Club Sandwich and a Curly Fries....damn, there goes the diet!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/x0y6TU_03x7ZOjzKCiekkQ?select=8o1nt_uBhuouxxMs_yctaQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/x0y6TU_03x7ZOjzKCiekkQ?select=mNSs2QGULi0WF2mFyc5pyQThe Beef & Cheddars were ok.  The Roast Chicken Club was very good.  Of course, their Curly Fries are one of their signature items....and was solid.The kids working at this place were very friendly and were working hard to  keep the restaurant clean. I could hear them in the back talking about how to properly mop the floor and wipe down the tables.....sometimes the current generation gets it right.Return Factor - 75%

Some colleagues and I stopped by here for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu, I decided on the Kobe Sliders, $10.95 that came with a side of Onion Strings.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Sliders were very good....and the Onion Strings were delish!Our server was very friendly and attentive to our table.  Our Iced Teas and Water glasses were never empty.Overall, it was a great lunch.Return Factor - 85%

A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas. I went there with my mom and aunt and several friends and really enjoyed myself.They're open late and the sangria is also quite delicious!UPDATE:Do not miss the Thai beef salad.And skip the tuna tartare!I think I've found a place unique to Vegas -- don't know how true this statement is but it didn't have that chain feel to it.Located in a strip mall five minutes away from Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) is this spot that serves some really tasty tapas and refreshing drinks.  The one thing I will mention about the tapas: seafood dishes are good.Firefly is loud, crowded, and totally fun.  You got folks getting off of work and looking to unwind and chill, groups celebrating b-days, couples enjoying the setting, and a crowded bar with people waiting for the next open table.The staff is fairly friendly and very accommodating.  They were especially cool about my request for pitchers of caparinias instead of glasses.The only thing is parking can be sparse since Firefly shares its parking lot with Ruth Chris's -- so be prepared to search.Overall, local or not, you should give Firefly a try.WOW!I was completely blown away by this place.  My friend from Vegas lives and dies by this place, and I now know why!Upon our arrival into Las Vegas, my friend immediately decided that this is where we would be eating for dinner.  After a quick shower and some down time, we finally met back up with my friend and hailed a cab to Firefly.Miami needs a Firefly!  What a great ambiance.  When we first arrived, they were a bit crowded and we sat at the bar to have a couple of drinks and await our table.  Not too long after, we were seated in a seperate area that was originally the restuarant next door.  Great atmosphere and loved the decoration.  Low lighting, lots of use of the color red.  Totally my vibe!  :)I was advised that EVERYTHING on the menu is absolutely delicious, and that I MUST try the croquetas and empanadas.  Alrighty then, I said.  Here we go!  Oh, and the Sangria is a must-try too!Between 3 of us we had:*the Ham & Cheese Croquetas - OMG, delish!  Soooo tasty with the addition of the cheese!  A new fave.*the Empanadas (with Pork) - very tasty and cooked to perfection, with the crispiest, flakiest dough that melts in your mouth.*the Crispy Duck rolls - these were good, but not my fave.  A little gamey for my taste, and I usually really like duck, but the crispyness was good and I enjoyed the cherry sauce drizzled over...*Petite Filet - hands down my FAVE dish of the night.  The filet was cooked to perfection, and the mushrooms were just melt-in-your-mouth good!  The roasted potatoes that were also mixed in, along with the red wine sauce, were just PERFECTION.  :)*Manchego Mac&Cheese - what an awesome twist on a traditional dish!  I must learn to make this at home.*Tuna Tartare - WOW!  I've never had such delicious tuna.  It was not served as traditional thin slices, but in small diced pieces with a delicious sauce (not sure what the sauce was) drizzled over it, served on a bed of edamame and enoki salad with taro chips.  I would use the chip to pile on everything else on top of it and then eat this crunch concoction!  SOOOO GOOD!For dessert we all shared the Banana-Nutella sandwiches, which were ORGASMICLY divine!  My new favorite dessert!  SOOOO tasty.I give this place 5+++++ Stars!  I wish I would have had the chance to return while on my trip, but alas it was too short.  I will DEFINITELY be back here the next time I am in Vegas to try the rest of the items on the menu!Firefly is the kind of place we usually like to take visitors from out of town when they want something cool and hip, but without the chaos of the strip (nor the exuberant prices).They started us off with a plate of bread, buttery good stuff, and green olives as we checked out the menu.  To get things started for our party of five, we ordered a pitcher of sparkling sangria ($24).  To grub on...* Stuffed dates "bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese" ($4) - Everyone always loves these.  It's just a bite of intense flavor and goodness, and there's bacon!  About four to an order. * Terra y Mare skewers "grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde" ($10) - Came with three skewers, it was good, not great, but okay.* Firefly" fish sticks "fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs, spicy tartar sauce" ($6) - Arrived with two sticks per order.* Merguez "spicy lamb sausage, tomato-pepper confit, grilled bread" ($8) - A strong taste that gets some getting used to. The Husband was loving this stuff.* Pulpo asado "marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato" ($7.50) - The octopus was bit overcooked, not quite what I expected.  But then again, it probably was frozen and that altered the texture a bit.* Steamed mussels "red curry, white wine and coconut cream" ($8) - My favorite of the bunch, full of flavor in this red curry with two slices of toasted cheese bread for dipping.  I saved the sauce for my paella and bread.* Ahi tuna skewer "mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze" ($10) - Cooked tuna, which I don't care for too much.  Our friend got lured into ordering this by the waitress he thought was cute.* Paella "saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage" ($15) - Good stuff with lots of good stuff in it.  Tasty, and of course, even better with the red curry sauce from the Steamed Mussels dish.* Sparkling Sangria ($24 pitcher) - Enough to fill at least five glasses and really tasty too.  It's a light drink, with only a bit of fruit bits in it.  But definitely enjoyable by guys and girls.  We ordered another pitcher during our visit.Overall, some food times are good and standout-worthy while others can remain unseen.  The sangria is perfect for sharing and has enough alcohol in it for you to be feeling pretty good.  Service was better in the beginning with our waitress checking up on us and our dirty plates disappearing in a timely manner.  It slacked off a bit when our waitress didn't come around anymore and when the busboys were a bit overanxious in trying to clear plates that weren't empty yet.3.5 starsHappy Hour: Mondays through Thursdays: 3 pm to 6 pmFridays: 3 pm to 5 pm (1/2 off all drinks)Tuesdays: Latin Night, from 10 pm to 2 am (salsa, meringue, cumbia, rock, no cover)I live in LA and I come to Vegas every year for New Years and this is the one spot that I have to hit up each and every time.Four words = AMAZINGLY ORGASMICALLY DELICIOUSLY GOOD!!!!I think by now I've tried all the tapas on their menu already and I would have to give each tapas 5 stars each so that equals out to hundreds of stars total for Firefly. :DMy favorite tapas are:-Filet Mignon Sliders-Empanadas-Fried Calamari-Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms-Tuna Tartare -Crispy Duck Rolls-Ham and Cheese CroquetasEven their fries are off the hook because it has a hint of parmesan, herbs, and aioli and their Mojitos - I can get drunk off of that all day everyday. yUuMmMmmYlicious to EVERYTHING on the menu - no joke!We came here last time we were in Vegas and loved it, so last weekend when we were in Vegas again we had to come back.  We brought a Vegas resident friend who had never been here before and she loved it too.  It's a very cool place.  Both times we've gone have been during the day, but I can see how this would be a great evening date place, although from other reviews it looks like it gets pretty busy on weekend evenings.  Most of the dishes are small tapas plates so it's a great place to go, order a bunch of different dishes and share with your pals.  Between four of us, we had:Bread, cheese spread, green olives (free appetizer);Roasted eggplant cannelloni (with goat cheese and tomato sauce);Tuna tartare (with mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado and taro chips);Manchego mac 'n' cheese (baby shells baked with cheese);Empanadas (pastry stuffed with roast pork and red pepper, served with salad and aioli);Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms (we got 2 orders);Filet mignon sliders (mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales cheese and caramelized onions) (we got 2 orders);Crispy duck rolls (with cherry hoisin sauce);Firefly fish sticks (fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs and spicy tartar sauce);Chorizo clams (peppers, two kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts)Everything was great, but my favorites were the stuffed mushrooms, duck rolls and chorizo clams.  I guess I'm down for just about anything with chorizo in it.  Not only was the taste of the dishes great, but the presentation was fantastic too.  It's the kind of food you look at and even if you don't like something in it you can't wait to try it because it looks so good.The price was reasonable, with most tapas dishes costing between $5 to $10 each.  The four of us were stuffed afterwards and the total including tax, tip and drinks came out to about $120.  I'd definitely come back here anytime I'm in Vegas.This restaurant is completely amazing! The selection and portion of food is perfect, sometimes you go to tapa's places you get A shrimp with your order or if you are vegetarian there aren't any options. At Firefly they have it all- Seafood, Beef, Chicken, Pork, Veggie. . .Some of my favorites are Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Warm Spinach Salad, Stuffed Dates (TO DIE FOR), Diablo Shrimp-Truly have never had anything bad there. Also, the Sangria and Mojito's are phenomenal, but I will have to say, they made a damn good Dirty Martini!  Great place for a date, girls night out or starting point for a night out on the Las Vegas Strip. . . . Get there early though it get's busy!@FireflyLV on Paradise has long been known as an OFF the STRIP hotspot with hundreds of reviews,photos and news articles about it. Recently they opened a 2nd location at the Plaza in downtown Las Vegas and it has received an ever BETTER reception if that is possible. The view downtown seems to be all the rave:) My visit was around 7pm on a Thursday night since I've seen the crowds here on the weekend I wanted to avoid a long wait and I was delighted to be seated immediately. The place was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time eating & drinking. We ordered filet mignon sliders, fries, some lamb chops and the waitress recommended the bacon wrapped dates!!! No drinks this time The menu has a nice selection of tapas all priced very reasonably and the food is presented like those other higher priced chic places;) The food was incredible, the dates are fantastic, wrapped in bacon with crumbled bleu cheese in a red wine reduction. Soooooo Good I had 2 orders:) The lamb chops were great, cooked perfectly medium-rare in a nice wine reduction sauce with julienned veggies and capers. Really I could have ate 10-12 of the lamb chops and been good. The sliders I didn't like the cheese sauce I could have done without-maybe some dijon mustard instead-the filet mignon burger didnt seem any different than any other sliders Ive had. I like the crispy onion straws but I'll skip the sliders next time. The fries were good-nothing spectacular just fries with grated cheese. I'd like to see some truffle fries or something;) The dessert was outlandish-Chocolate and cherry bread pudding[warm w/port wine reduction, vanilla ice cream] -I could have ate another one. It was a TOUGH choice between the bread pudding and the Banana-Nutella sandwiches[w/Nutella cream dipping sauce] which the table next to us was enjoying:) My overall experience was fantastic the service was fast,friendly and quite helpful. The food was good. The atmosphere was fun & comfortable. When I left iasked the hostess if I could present the manager with something She looked at me a little strange but came back with the manager who was quite pleasant and accepted the TOP RATED RESTAURANT(#3) on Urbanspoon I gave him-telling me it would be given to the right person. UPDATE: To my pleasant surprise it has been placed in the menu marquee right outside the front door:)So... there was no seating available indoors, so my girlfriend and I agreed to sit outdoors. I don't know about you, but it's very hard for me to enjoy a meal (or anything) in 120 degree weather... until Firefly. You are amazing.Killing time playing Blackjack on a Saturday night before 8 pm dinner reservations at Firefly, we mentioned to our pert little dealer we were dining there.  "I *love* that place!"  she squealed, "Get the mac 'n' cheese!"  When we piled into the taxi later and told our driver, "Firefly on Paradise," he crowed, "That place is great!  Get the mac 'n' cheese!"Dinner at Firefly (which SIL found through Yelp) was for husband's birthday bash.  SIL had been working with the the manager via e-mail for weeks to arrange a group dinner for 13 of us.  For 2 hours and $50 a head, we could eat as many of the 6 pre-selected tapas (which SIL had chosen after reading the hundreds of Yelp reviews) we wanted, and drink as much alcohol as we desired.  SIL said that dealing with the manager through e-mails to arrange dinner had been a pleasure -- smooth and easy.We started with fresh bread and ramekins of almond butter.  Which was not the almond version of peanut butter I was expecting, but butter blended with crushed almonds, slightly sweet and delicious.  The tapas we sampled were:1) Dates stuffed with smoked almonds, wrapped in bacon, and drizzled with a red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles.  The combos of salty and sweet, chewy and crunchy, were really pleasing.2) Veggie empanadas -- airy, thin, crisp pastry filled with spinach, mushroom, artichoke, and herbed cream cheese, covered with red pepper aioli.  Remarkably interesting and flavorful.3)  Steak and mushroom skewers -- grilled filet, button 'shrooms, roast garlic cream, and a red wine reduction.  Meat itself was a bit tough but tasted good, and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.  Garlic cream was a phenomenal foil to the dish.4) Steamed babyback ribs with mango BBQ sauce.  Nice flavor, falling off the bone tender, but really fatty like a lot of ribs.5) Camarones a la diabla -- shrimp in a *spicy* chile sauce served with grilled bread. My personal favorite tapas.  Burn-your-lips spicy (in a great way) and explosive with flavor.  Shrimp were plump, juicy, and cooked just right.And finally...the pièce de résistance: 6) Manchego mac 'n' cheese.  After all the build up, after all the recommendations, you could practically here the "womp wommp" hovering over the table as we sampled it.  Sundried tomatoes were a great, flavorful addition, and the dish itself tasted good.  But it was soupy and not nearly as fabulous as we'd expected.  Dessert was small plates of caramel flan, chocolate tres leches cake, and banana Nutella sandwiches.  All three were delicious.We drank our fill of white and red sangrias, pitchers of mojitos, and bottles of wine and beer.  Service was wonderfully attentive and efficient.  Atmosphere was like a neighborhood bar: loud, crowded, and boisterous, everyone enjoying themselves immensely.  Ambiance was laid-back, very casual, and comfortable.  We were *so* glad we got off the Strip on this visit to enjoy a local favorite!  We weren't disappointed.[15 Minutes of Fame: "Rachael Ray's $40 a Day"]Love love love this place.Food: Stuffed dates-blue cheese stuffed and wrapped with bacon. What? You can't go wrong with these bad boys. Ham & Cheese Croquetas-just your basic ham and cheese popper, right? I think not.  I loved these.Pulpo Asado-pretty good. Not great. Perhaps a tad bit overdone, not sure.  Roasted eggplant cannelloni-light and fresh. Filet mignon sliders-tasty and substantial. Service: Great. No wait on a Friday night, but then again, it was around midnight.Attentive waiters, quick food turnaround.  Price: Each dish can run anywhere from $4 to $10 for the tapas and since you'll be ordering quite a few, it can get a bit pricey.  Throw in a pitcher of the must have sangria for $24 and you've got yourself quite the bill.  Still, in the town of excess, this is still a bargain.  This is definitely a must try place.I heart tapas and I heart Firefly. I don't go nearly as often as I feel I should. Can't get enough of this place. We had another get together here with some friends and had yet another fantastic evening. I love almost everything on the menu. The lamb skewers are always cooked perfectly. The dates are to die for. We ordered some other of our favorites; pitchers of blood orange mojitos, patron peppers, mac n cheese and some tortilla espanola. Yum, yum and more yum. Can't get enough of this place. Still need to try the location on Sahara, though.Tapa DelightThe Gist:*A random strip mall with pretty intense restaurants that inhabit the place*Cute little lounge*I think the table an inch away is eavesdropping...*Pitchers of sangria- too bad I'm driving straight to Cali right after!*Small dish of olives & "croutons" came out to entice the palate *Ceviche & both kinds of empanadas were good*Servers were nice & cleared out plates efficiently My quick visit cost me about $23 for three small plates. I'll probably want to give this place another shot to taste the "must-haves" of the menu...but that depends on if anyone else is in the mood for some tapas.My partner is suffering from food poisoning right now as I write this review - thanks alot firefly.  We assume it's from the chicken skewers or an apple salad - these are the only things I didn't try of his, Thank God.  We ate around 8pm on 4/25/11, he was throwing up by 11:30pm.  It's 2:21am now and he's still praying to the porcelain god.  This is horrible and obviously we will never come back - I feel disgusted and almost want to ask you for a fucking refund.  We weren't expecting a side of salmonella or e Coli with dinner tonight.  Also, thanks for ruining what was a great vacation thus far.My first impression was, "A hidden find off the strip."You wouldn't be able to tell from the outside all the goods this little restaurant has to offer on the inside. They have a cute little patio where you enter, and inside the ambiance is cool, mellow, and has a lounge/bar area. Little did we realize we were ordering plate after plate of Spanish tapas. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were typical of tapas entrees. We tried several, however, one thing that I crave and would definitely go back for were their stuffed dates. They were absolutely amazing. These little dates are wrapped in bacon, stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese, and all grilled under red wine. Sounds irresistible right? You'll see why yelpers rage about these little delectable bites. If you're planning on trying something off the tourist list while visiting Las Vegas, this is one you must try!The lasting impression? "Great place for small bites with a side of wine or a series of mini plates for a creative meal."My first impression was, "I'd be back in Vegas just for their bacon wrapped dates with toasted almonds and blue cheese."Here's a second review of Firefly after being there just a week ago and trying some more tapas plates with my friends. We first ordered a pitcher of red Sangria for the table since it was happy hour (1/2 price on all drinks) and of course, what goes better with Spanish tapas than a nice glass of wine? Our table of four had plenty of wine to share for just $14.00. It came in a pretty tall pitcher, well chilled, and with chopped apples inside for presentation.-Chorizo Clams (peppers, 2 kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts) the bits of chorizo mixed with the sauce for a sweet and spicy combination was delicious.-Steamed Mussles (red curry, white wine and coconut cream) the sauce which really becomes a soup is the feature of this dish. It was rich and flavorful and goes so well with the mussles!-Stuffed Dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) must try must try must try. Too out of this world.-Stuffed Peppers (Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce) The combination was good and they got a lot of cheese in the dish, but the sauce wasn't too impressive. I'd say pass on this one and get more stuffed dates. But good if you love your tomatoes and cheese, pasta sauce taste.-Mushroom Tart (puff pastry, boursin cheese) Simply good.The lasting impression? "Check out the photos, you'll be sold. It's a great place to go on a casual date or share a pitcher with little Spanish tapas and enjoy a good meal with a group of friends. It's a nice breather off the Strip in LV."In the words of the effervescent and poorly dress MC Hammer this place is: Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey! Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey!Located in a strip mall near the Las Vegas Convention Center, it would be very easy to overlook Firefly and run off to its more glamorous competitors...but I'm so happy we took a cab to enjoy this local favorite. The atmosphere at Firefly has a friendly and slightly frantic feel to it as it's packed to the brim with a mix of tourists and locals. We waited by the bar and met some really nice people who we chatted with and they offered us some of their food. Wow, how nice is that?!We were seated about 5 minutes after we arrived and were taken outside to another door which opened to the other half of the restaurant. I guess they expanded but didn't knock down the wall in between. We didn't really care, we were just happy to get a table quickly! As other reviewers have written the small plates can get pricey, especially if you've got a YELP sized appetite, but the food is delish! We ordered 10 different dishes and all you have to know is three words: Bacon wrapped dates. Do it, do it right now you fool!Yelp 365 Challenge: #48/365 (The Dates)There's nothing to say about Firefly that others haven't already said but I'd like to offer up a few thoughts.  For one, it's gotta to be one of my favorite restaurants to be at in Vegas.  The ambiance, the aura, and the sangria/cocktails (definitely a struggling AA members nightmare), are awesome.  Secondly, I love how fast the food comes to the table when you order something.  I like things done lightning fast so I was surprised with the 21-service rating in Zagat.  I'd have thought is would have been around 23-24.  The food rating is where it's at though 24 sounds just about right.  What I love most about Firefly though is how reasonable their prices are.Here's a listing at our recent visit:Pitcher Sangria - $28Boquerones - $5.50Beet Salad - $5.50Dates - $4Pulpo Asado - $7.50Steamed Mussels - $8Empanada - $4.50Crispy Duck Roll - $6Babyback Ribs - $9.50Lamb Chops - $8.50Paella - $20Not all of what we ordered was good.  But, all-in-all, NICE!  My favorites were the Empanada, Steamed Mussels, and Babyback Ribs.  Pretty decent dishes were the Boquerones (anchovies), Crispy Duck Roll (just the duck itself), and the Paella (although I can make a better paella with my eyes closed...paella is the only thing I can cook though).You can't do Vegas without a visit to Firefly for some quality food at reasonable prices!Eat It OR Beat It?**EAT IT!!**BEST tapas I've tried. The pitcher of sangria (red and white) is very delicious! Normally, people who visit Vegas don't venture off the strip too much, but Firefly is a restaurant you must must visit! The dates wrapped in bacon is my personal favorite!Forget spending 3x the money at the Bazaar in Beverly Hills for snooty subpar tapas... try this place out! CONCLUSION:If you're tired of eating buffets and want to mix it up, I recommend coming to Firefly! The prices are very reasonable and the food is rich and full of flavor! So, I say, EAT IT!!!!!!!!!!uh.maze.ing. You don't see many restaurants rated at 4.5 stars very often. And a local friend recommended this place as his favorite so we were intrigued. The restaurant is in a little strip mall of a parking lot- nothing too fancy. The dress is nice but casual and you don't need a suit. There are no stuffy white table cloths to be found. I'm sure they appreciate elbows off the table but I love any restaurant where I don't have to be conscious about proper manners. We went early around 7:30/8pm and luckily our group of 6 immediately got a table. The service was great, ambiance was perfect and the food was incredible. Order the pitcher of red sangria ($28). It was delicious!We ordered 3 plates each expecting little servings of tapas. We were surprised with the generous portions (small salad plate style) and was planning on ordering more but couldn't even finish those. I can't decide what was my favorite. All of these dishes woke up our taste buds: bacon wrapped Stuffed Dates, Tuna Tartare, Smoked Salmon Toasts, Filet Mignon Sliders, Crispy Duck Roll, Babyback Ribs, Fried Calamari, Warm Spinach Salad with strawberries.Trio of Gelato (pistaccio is my fav) and the Dessert Platter were yummy. The dessert platter was just a taste of all the desserts and just enough so we didn't feel like we were missing out. We couldn't have fit any more food in our bellies.I would skip the Fish Sticks (wish they would make them smaller and it was nothing special). And the Artichoke Toasts were the only disappointment. They sounded so hopeful on the menu but were served cold and in a chunk. It couldn't keep up with the rest of the wonderful plates on our table. And best of all, our bill was affordable and didn't break the bank.Ay Caramba!!!!I Love This Place!!!!On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! Then came our drinks and tapas!I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.Now onto the tapas...Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!Happy Eats!My girl friends and I must have ate Firefly's kitchen out.  We had 10 tapas and a pan of paella for lunch before, of course, dropping our guts at Encore Beach Club.  Sexy! The paella is an absolute must-have for $20 (Toto, I've a feeling we're not in San Francisco anymore!).  It was chock-full of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, chicken, and chorizo--I couldn't believe there was more seafood than saffron rice.  My favorite small plates were the camarones a la diabla (shrimp in spicy chile sauce), stuffed dates, and chorizo clams.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked in a delectable sauce--after we had all the shrimp, we hung on to the sauce and smothered anything and everything with it.  The dates were small, though tasty and complex.   The clams were in a lighter sauce than the shrimp but also delicious simmered in chorizo and white wine. I would skip the roasted baby beet salad, tortilla a la Espanola (Spanish omelette), and the lobster escargots.  There were barely any beets in the salad; the tortilla not only looked but tasted unappetizing; and the lobster escargots were so small I can't even remember their taste.I've had paella and tapas in Spain and at many memorable restaurants in the US.  Firefly doesn't come close to the top, but the prices are so reasonable (for Vegas!) and the selection is so vast (even the pickiest of eaters can't whine!) that I have to bump this 3-star tapas bar to 4 stars.  Plus, it's nice to leave the Strip for a meal!You know I do love tapas. Ever since Cha Cha Cha in SF, I've been crazy for tapas. After the many good reviews from Firefly, I came here with two friends to try it out. We wanted to order everything but tried to limit it to what we could eat. So we ordered:Lobster Escargot. A little on the mushy side. Portion is small. I'm warning you now so that you don't have a shock face like I did when I saw it. There's about five pieces. Good start to the food though.Filet Mignon Sliders. This was good. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Slight pink on the inside and juicy. There was also crispy onions on the side and along with two sliders. The aioli in the slider was a definite ingredient that separated Firefly's sliders from other places. Stuffed Mushroom. Chicken was a bit dry but I like mushrooms so I'm getting it anyways. Came in four pieces.Camarones Al Ajillo. About 6 medium sized shrimps and one hell of an amazing sauce. The shrimps were not mushy. The sauce went perfect with the bread given. Got to impress me with sauce when I go to tapas eateries.Along with our $30 pitcher of watermelon mojito which had Bacardi rum in it yet did not taste as strong as I thought it would, My friends and I were still a bit hungry. So we went and order the Paella. Not the best I've had. The rice a bit overcooked but the ingredients in here is absolutely worth your money. The seafood were plentiful and more than the average selection at other restaurants. Our total bill was about $90. We were full after for our party of 3. The restaurant is not too big and it's off the strip of Las Vegas. However, very much worth coming. Service was attentive, had no problem with it. It's located in a plaza so there is also lots of parking.Sitting in a fairly unassuming and cookie-cutter shopping center east of the Strip is this gem of a tapas restaurant. I hate the fact that every place uses the term "tapas" to mean small dishes when they aren't serving spanish food. Okay, so I'm being somewhat picky about the terminology, but it bugs me when I see a japanese izakaya that advertises itself as japanese tapas; an izakaya implies small dishes and pub food! Will dimsum be thrown to the curb to ape a more trendy term as well?! Okay, okay, that was probably out of line. Let's move on, shall we?Showed up with a group of six for a late sunday night dinner. No problem, we get seated right away a few feet from romancing couples and a table of near naked people celebrating halloween.  Off to a good start as far as I'm concerned.Here's the low down on what we got:Ceviche - tasty, there were larger and smaller pieces of shrimp and the bright citrus flavor was better than the salty watered down salsa versions I've had elsewhere.Stuffed Dates - wow, so good. The dates aren't that sweet and you mostly get the smokey bacon flavor with a hint of sweetness and a crunch almond surprise on the inside. The blue cheese goes really nice with it.Patatas Bravas - probably my least favorite out of everything we got that night. Tastes like big chunks of red potato. Meh.Thai Beef Salad - I'm not really sure what that thai beef was, but it seemed like a pancake made of protein with things mixed in. Tasted okay, but I wasn't in a salad mood which might explain why I didn't love this one either.Fried Calamari - Pretty straight up dish with nothing either outstanding about it nor bad. If you like fried calamari elsewhere, you'll probably like it here.  I'd probably save my stomach for something you can't find at every Italian restaurant on earth.Beef Empanada - These were really good if you like a flaky pastry with meat filling. The only bad thing was that there's two pieces to an order.Paella - Wow, by far my favorite! Order 2 per person so you'll never have to share. The chorizo was really good and I kept ignoring the seafood to snag some. I want a plate of this in front of me right now and I wouldn't hesitate to shoot a deer in the face to have it.What I'd want to try next time:Chicken and Chorizo Stuff MushroomsCrabclaw Corn DogsTuna TartareSausage PlateGreat place. Really dark inside (a table near us used their phones to read the menu) with an overabundance of those crappy paintings of spanish dancers shown from behind wearing a red dress that you see being sold on every cruise art auction.  Stop buying those paintings, people! They're pumped out of a kinko's printer in Cincinnati onto canvas!TL;DR: Don't buy crappy art; eat at Firefly now.Packed on a Monday evening!! I think we waited about a half hour.  Sangria!!! Firefly is a tapas bar located off the strip but absolutely worth the drive or taxi ride for those who enjoy awesome food, drinks and atmosphere. Sometimes it's nice to get off the strip away from all the gambling and tourists.Food and service were also great!-Ceviche - very tasty.-Thai Beef Salad - this might have been my favorite dish.-Empanada - good!-Bacon Wrapped Dates - a must.The three of us shared a pitcher of Sangria It's as good as the Sangria I make at home...which is really good!! We had a great time!1200 reviews and 4 1/2 stars? I had to try this place. Plus, it gave me another excuse for tapas! No reservations for Fri or Sat- but they take them any other day of the week.Sooo- we came on a Sunday instead. We had made reservations ahead of time and were promptly seated. For being a Sunday night during off-season, the place was still pretty crowded. There is very low lighting- so if you expect some amazing phone photos of your food, probably not going to happen unless you drown it in a flash.There were a ton of things that we wanted to try on the menu and the server gladly explained his pros/cons on each of our choices while recommending some of his own. There was no rush, but he continually checked in with us to see if we were ready or had any other inquiries. I was glad there were four of us- we really pigged out.While we waited, we went for their house sangria. Though I'm not a wine person, it was pretty fantastic. It was light and fruity, but after glass two, I was definitely feeling a nice buzz. We ordered a pitcher for the four of us and it was probably the better deal since we each got about two glasses out of it. If you're not lightweights like us, a pitcher between two people would probably be sufficient, too. It's definitely a great drink while enjoying your food.We inhaled:Serrano Sliders: Filet mignon with serrano ham, grilled onions and clouds of heaven. Not the menu description, but I think I heard angels singing when I bit into them. They were super moist, cooked medium and the cheese was melted perfectly in the soft, yet crispy bun. These were so amazing that I'll probably compare every other slider experience in the future to these little things.Manchengo Mac and Cheese: Came out in a little skillet that was still bubbling when served. It was crispy on top with a generous amount of bread crumbs. It wasn't too cheesy and split between four people, it was just enough without weighing us down. I loved the strong taste of the cheese and liked that it was so gooey without being watery. Even if there were two of us, I'd still probably order it again.Stuffed Dates: These sweet things were stuffed with blue cheese and then wrapped in bacon. The bacon was perfectly cooked with some nice crispy fat and it was unanimous that it was the favorite dish of the night.It comes in a serving of 5, so we all got one and I got an extra. I'm seriously salivating thinking of the sweet and savory combination and wish that they had a location in CA for me to indulge in... but it's probably better that they don't.Firefly Fries: It's a generous portion served with melted parmesan cheese on top. For dipping, it comes with aioli. The french fries were crispy and I loved the oil that they were cooked in. It didn't even really need the sauce that accompanied it and it was plenty for the four of us.Albondigas: These were like mini meatballs with the tomato sauce and parmesan sprinkled on top. They were delicious and moist and held some great flavors. As soon as they hit the table, we pretty much inhaled it. Definitely worth getting.Empanadas: A hit as well. Really enjoyed the flaky pastry outside and the super moist pork inside. The peppers gave it a nice little kick, but nothing a swig of sangria couldn't extinguish. It was so good, I again forgot to use the dipping sauce that came with it.Baked Tetilla: Just like the description says, it's fondue- so super cheese. It comes with crisp pieces of toast to spread the combo of cheese, tomato and chorizo on. We saved it and continued to dip our fries in it after the bread was gone. There was no way in hell we were going to let any go to waste!Fried Calamari: This was good, but standard calamari. It was good, but I would opt for something a little more adventurous next time.Tierra y Mar Skewers: Little kebobs with shrimp, filet and chorizo. I loved the charred tasted from the grill. The combination of these three proteins was pretty genius, each meat was delicious on their own and even better together.Chorizo Plate: Different types of thinly sliced chorizo served on a plate with capers. This was probably our least favorite dish. It wasn't bad, but we shouldn't have ended with it. It would have worked better as one of our beginning courses. It wasn't bad, but we had a bunch of hearty samples and this was light and salty. Banana and Nutella Sandwiches: Now this was the perfect way to end a meal. It was like crack and we almost ordered a second serving because it was so damn good. It was like french toast with bananas on the inside. Add in the nutella and it was the dessert of the gods. Super simple but extra delicious. This is a must if you're in the mood for a sweet finale.Service was impeccable. Someone constantly came around to clear our plates and refill drinks. This place deserves a 6th star and will become one of my regular Las Vegas stops for sure!HH (only alcoholic drinks 50% off) @ Mon- Thur 3-6 PM & Fri 3-5 PMFree appetizer bread, olives & sweet butter so yumny 10ptsTuna ta tare so yummy; great chips that came on the side 9 ptsCamarones a la diabla bit spicy & sweet 10 ptsSteamed mussels w/red curry...so delicious 11 ptsMango mojito wasn't too sweet... 9 ptsPear martini so yumny & perfect  11 ptsPatio area is great for groups =)Service was great; prompt & friendly.See those 2 stars up there? They serve as a reminder that no matter how good your food is, if the service blows then you've lost me as a customer forever. Came here mid-afternoon on a Tuesday, when it was lively but not exactly crowded. Our waiter, a diminutive Mexican with a thick accent and leopard mohawk which belied personality, came by to take our drink orders. I went with a traditional mojito and my gf got a sangria. Once they were dropped off, he came back to take our food order. We wanted to sample a lot, so I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, tuna peppers, lamb skewers, and fish sticks. Man, everything was awesome!My mojito was perfectly prepared. The bacon wrapped dates are astoundingly good. They're small, but each one packs a serious flavor punch. Tuna peppers were light & refreshing, with a slight kick. The fish sticks had a tasty sauce accompany them, but otherwise I wasn't overly impressed. But the lamb skewers rocked, and they came with a side of... ah, geez... it was either couscous or quinoa. It was great. Everything was so great, in fact, that we were dying to order more. But our waiter was MIA. I scanned the place for him - nada. The few times I did see him, he showcased his learned skills in the art of "how to not make eye contact with customers". After around 10-15 of this shtick, I gave up. Finally, I flagged down a busboy and asked for the check. Then our waiter magically appears with the check and asks me if I want dessert. You're joking, right? I told him no and handed him my card, since I didn't feel like waiting to see when he'd show up to collect my payment. He returned it quickly with a muttered "thank you" that sounded like someone forced him at gunpoint to say it. I gave him around a 6% tip, which my dad later told me should've been ZERO. Per his wisdom, a low tip only makes you look cheap, but no tip says "fuck you, you suck". Should've gone zero. I might return here - the food was so damn good I could make my mouth water just thinking about it, but the shit service had me so hopping mad after we finished that I couldn't wait to jet out of there. If you're a manager, tell the mohawked server to grow a personality commensurate with his hairstyle. You lost more of my money because of him, and I've got a sneaking suspicion I'm not the only one.FOOD POISONINGI hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant.I dined with a friend visiting from London  on 04//22 from around 8-10pmwe atefried calamaripatatas bravasTIERRA Y MAR skewerslamb skewerscrispy duck rollSerrano sliders (on website menu as Fillet Mignon Sliders)I am still recovering, but the worst of it was 04/24-04/27My friend, flew back to the UK 04/23  and has been in hospital since 04/26  and still has sever symptoms.This is terrible.All the best to everyone still recovering.1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.I ate there on April 25, the day before the board of health shut it down for 3 dozen cases of food poisoning. I choose firefly based on the comments on Yelp. From NY, and now back home and suffering from food poisoning from their cheap and bad food. Be warned, if they open again. What happens in Vegas does not stay there.I type this in my hospital bed so I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. I as ate here 4/23/12 with about 5 other friends from out of town to show off how amazing this place is. And it was another great dining experience.... 72 hours later or less and I'm in a state of what seems to be nearing death.  And it seemed none of my friends were affected but they were/are. I just happened to get it the worst!! I've been a firefly customer for 5 years! Never have I gone through anything like this. I may never come back and never recommend this particular firefly toAnyone or anyone coming to visit Las Vegas... I'm still in shock this has happened.  Most expensive dining experience ever. Thanks a lot.*** also this was no food poisoning I got for all you dim witted fools that think otherwise. Salmonella feels like and is (currently) Hell. SALMONELLAI got Salmonella poisoning from here. We ate there last Wednesday 4/23/13. Thought this was a nice place. Went to VegAs for my birthday and had dinner with 6 of my friends and every one of us got salmonella poisoning. One of my friends was hospitalized for 5 days. Ruined my trip, my birthday and now I can't pay rent because I've had to call into work the last 5 days. Thanks a lot I will never ever go here again.Never Again!This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for "renovations".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!This place used to be one of my favorites! But guess what? I was one of the lucky ones who got food poisoning. Obviously, I will never go back to this place or their sister restaurants, the way I felt for a week is not worth the risk. I was there with a friend and we had their sparkling sangria, rib eye steak with fries, stuffed dates, apple and manchego salad and mussels with chorizo.  Their service was great and their food taste as their usual, but unfortunately one day later I ended up getting salmonella. I was at a volunteer event when my symptoms started, I actually had to leave the place and go home because I could not even walk straight.  The diarrhea started when I got home and then the abdominal cramping came, it was as if I were a girl in my period. Gals, I know what you go through and I feel ya! I wish I could recommend this place, but my advice is: EAT THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Review Text :
Lets just say that I go here for lunch at least twice a week. As does the rest of my office. It is that good. Not just because its a hop skip and a jump from my building, but every sub I have ever had here, minus the Philly cheese steak which we will discuss later, has been tasty and fresh and simply delightful.I've tried The Dodge City - Pepperoni, Salami, Provolone, etc, .. The Caribou- Turkey Breast, Double Provolone, Avocado, LTM etc... & The Comstock - Roast Beef, Provolone etc.. I love everything about all of these EXCEPT for the fact that they do not *actually* use avocado slices, its more like, avocado paste. Not guacamole. Paste. Still tasty if you can get past the texture, but I would prefer the real deal. Now like I said, Ive also had the Philly Cheese Steak. Ive got to be honest. It tasted like vomit and old cow. There wasn't enough cheese and the peppers on it were overwhelming. Silvermine either needs to a.) alter this recipe immediately or b.) completely nix it from the menu. It was g.r.o.s.s.Let me give you a little money saving hint while I'm at it.. It is cheaper to order a sammich that has all the toppings you want then removing something rather than adding an extra topping to a sammich. if that makes sense.. At almost $2ea for some of them, ie: pasty avocado, you will certainly save a little.. especially if you eat here at the rate that me and my fellow Terraleverians do.The Silver Mine Subs' Tucson location got me through college at U of A, especially thanks to their late hours and delivery! Since those days, I've had this Silver Mine Subs in Tempe a couple times and to sum it up: they provide a decent sandwich that hits the spot but doesn't make me want to necessarily write home about it. It's just a decent sub that's especially good if you're in a huge hurry, you're kind of broke or you're hungry after the bars and need some food to eat on the cab ride home. I like that this location has a killer honey mustard they serve with their sandwiches. The bread is sofy and chewy and they offer a wide variety of toppings.

Review Text :
Ahhh...a restaurant with a name right out of the 80s. Bestow my heart! The BC as the regs call it, caps the end of little strip of shops in Oldtown Scottsdale. It is the Hugo's (West Hollywood reference) of Scottsdale. Lots of eye candy for boys and girls. The staff is mostly women, and quite the hotties they are. The space is very uncluttered and has great views of the passersbys and cars whippin' down Scottsdale Road. The oatmeal (add blueberries) is fantastic. The breakfast burrito is muy excelente. Orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and the coffee is strong and robust. Just like my Aunt Helen. The place is packed on the weekends, so expect a wait. Truly a hot,  hip spot on boulevard I call Snottsdale.The Breakfast Club sounds like and looks like it's going to be the best local place in town... unfortunately, I find it to be just average...Maybe it's just me because it's always packed!  Even today, on a Thursday morning around 10am, in the heat of the summer, it was pretty crowded.Anyways, the food is decent but I flat out received the wrong omelet today.  I ordered the mushroom fontina cheese omelet and I was given the mushroom, turkey, avocado, and cheese omelet instead.  Oh well - it was good, but not exactly what i ordered.  I will say, the portions are pretty big, and they are ok with substitutions... normally the omelets come with potatoes and fruit and I requested toast and tomato slices instead.  Coffee is decent and service ok (aside from delivering the wrong omelet).Tiffany C and I were pretty hungry and this certainly did the job of filling our bellies, but I probably will not rush back anytime so soon.  As Alicia says, MEH... not awful, not amazing. Not worth a long wait, but decent if you don't have high expectations!Long wait.  Ordered nutty pancakes,  Spied neighbor's great-looking omelette while waiting for said pancakes.  Tasted the cakes and wished I'd ordered the eggs.  Price-y menu made my mediocre dish even more disappointing.Felt out of place here with so many well-dressed, salon-bed tanned people. Breakfast is my favorite time of the day, and dining here brought my cheerful mood down fast.I returned to TBC this morning for a meeting with future yelper, Adriana C.  I'm giving them another star this time since there was no wait (9am on a weekday), service was prompt and attentive, and my coffee, oatmeal and side of egg whites came out just perfect!  It probably helped that I really enjoyed the company I was with as well.  Adriana's yogurt granola parfait and side of pancakes looked pretty fantastic as well.Lesson from this update: if you go to The Breakfast Club, go on a weekday and order something simple!An okay breakfast spot.The good news? If you're staying at the W Scottsdale you can walk here, it's only a block away. Oh and the W has no other breakfast options unless you feel like eating at Sushi Roku, yuck.The bad news? You'll likely have a bit of a wait and as far as breakfast places go, it's not that remarkable. Sure the eggs and bacon were fine, but nothing about this place says: kick ass breakfast. My friend and I were seated at the communal table. There was another random group of 2 seated at the other end. Two of my other friends tried to join us mid-meal (there were plenty of seats at the communal table) and were denied. The hostess said something about us dominating the communal table, not sure what that was supposed to mean but it sure was annoying.The Breakfast Club is awesome. It's one in a handful of trendy little breakfast spots in the Scottsdale area. It's located right on the north end of Old Town, the area is really chill and perfect for lounging on a nice day. So if there's a wait, which there usually is... it's not a nuisance to hang out; it's a pleasure! Like a lot of Old Town Scottsdale places, there is a certain hipster vibe you get from this place. If you go for a later breakfast like we usually do, you'll most certainly notice that about three fourths of the people eating there are club-goers from the previous night that went to bed way too late and drank too much while partying. Most of them look like they have not showered since getting home the previous night, and smell like a ridiculous mixture of B.O. and cheap cologne. Not exactly our crowd, but it does make for some fun people watching. They have a lot of dishes that are more on the adventurous side of the breakfast spectrum, but also have all the tried and true's as well. We opted with the cinnamon challah french toast which was very good and an omelet which we just loaded with all sorts of good shit... it was also quite yummy. It's also cool that there is a little coffee bar inside that you can order from while you wait or get stuff from to accompany your meal. All in all, we quite enjoyed The Breakfast Club... it's just a fun and chill little spot to grab a fresh and tasty morning treat.TBC has become a bit of a Scottsdale landmark over the past few years...I use it as a navigation landmark when I have people meeting me in town."Go north on Scottsdale Road and if you see 75 hung over people dressed in Affliction tee shirts and sequined mini-dresses, standing on a street corner waiting for a mediocre breakfast, you've gone too far...in so very many ways".I live (for another few weeks, at any rate) pretty close to TBC and yet, I don't really "go to there" very often (or at all) if I can avoid it.I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.In addition, the food and service have left me cold (much like my last omelet at TBC a few weeks ago) on my infrequent visits.But the amusement factor provided by TBC is (for me at least) quite high, and for that, I'm grateful!I've been twice in the past year...once for lunch, out of renewed curiosity (I was headed to another spot for lunch and saw a couple reading a menu outside another restaurant and discussing their lunch preferences in loud Scottish accents "I dinna want a fookin TACO, Angela...I wanna go to the fookin Breakfast Club!").That was almost a year ago...and I went once for breakfast, recently, because the Beautiful Carin likes TBC.And what Carin wants, Carin gets!But both visits featured mediocre food (esp. for the price) and mediocre service (at any price).My last visit also featured an apparently broken exhaust duct that runs under the booths at the north end of the place.Hot, humid cooking exhaust, coming up through the seams in the upholstery, steamy cooking aroma's wafting around me from below...I was about to call Guinness because I thought I was setting a new world record for sustaining a fart!But the aromatic breeze didn't stop! And even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!Our server was uninterested in this turn of events (when I let her know what was happening)...apparently I'm past the age when a 22 year old "model" (who happens to be slingin' hash) needs to pay any attention to me...even when they are theoretically being paid to do so!Maybe she wasn't being paid enough to listen to me...that's probably why some hookers get $2-3,000 an hour...to listen...bareback.At any rate, I was going to add a star to my review, since the warm air enema felt so darn nice, but what other restaurant can compete with that?It wouldn't be fair!TBC is clearly a club that doesn't need me as a member, and I'm OK with that.Don't you forget about me,don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me(Simple Mind - Don't You "Forget about me")The Breakfast Club was a cult classic in the 80's.  The Breakfast Club in Scottsdale does not disappoint.  Though not so much a classic yet, they do serve a mean breakfast - Yum! I ordered the Eggs Benedict while my partner ordered 2 eggs breakfast.  Eggs Benedict Arnold - haha! (Peter Griffin from Family Guy).  Needless to say I loved a good old fashion breakfast and they did not skimp on the portions.  (Enough for 5 mischievous students hmmm).  Like going back in time, back to the 80's, where breakfast was a time to stuff your face!  My eggs were over easy for sure while the soft and warm hollandaise sauce gently glazed over the eggs and ham.  Not too overpowering and just the right sweetness.  I had my hash extra crispy and my bacon; I like them soft and chewy.  I added some hot sauce and I had myself a grand meal.Will you recognize me? (After eating here and gaining some weight)Call my name and walk on by (A walk more like a run I'll need)Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling (More like falling asleep)Down, down, down, down (I go!)(Simple Mind - Don't You "Forget about me")The place itself had a business diner yet modern feel.  Not your typical dive diner for sure!  Service was spot on and keep that coffee flowing! - Enjoy!I had a good breakfast here, but even though I have an expense account when I travel for work, I'm still not comfortable paying excessively for what is ultimately a run of the mill breakfast. I had the cinnamon French toast, a side of scrambled eggs (served lukewarm) coffee and orange juice, and my bill with tip was $25. On the bright side, the service was a lot better than the Yelp consensus, just not enough to warrant such a steep price. Add Molly Ringwald to the equation and it would be well worth it, but without her this Breakfast Club is just a pedestrian experience posing as something it's not.This was my first time here and it was fun to meet up with some fellow Yelpers for a top secret UYE. Actually it was a great opportunity to meet Larry W from CA/TX as he drove through on his way back home. COOL!We arrived on a Saturday around Noonish and the place was super packed. They had a pretty good wait list and everyone outside looked very hungry.Ordered the Border Bowl and a giant glass of freshly squeezed OJ. Other members went with the Whole Hog plate, Eggs Benedict, a Caesar Chicken Wrap and some type of Veggie Dish.Everything was delicious and the portions were very large. The fresh squeezed OJ was definitely good and something I've not had in a long time. The Bloody Marys looked fantastic and were giant.We all had a great time visiting and the service was excellent. The menu has something for everyone and this would be a place that I'd bring the family back for a special occasion.The parking can be a little tricky and it is mostly behind the building. Just take you time and be careful driving in this part of town. The locals are pretty crazy and some of the streets nearby go around in circles. Dang shopping malls.See ya there next time and remember you can eat breakfast at any time of the day. There is no real written rule. ORDER UP!4 STARS

BIERLY EDIBLEHere's the sad part of this review: I use to love this restaurant brand. I ate at my first one during Spring Training in AZ near the ASU campus. It was a tradition for us all to go there yearly for dinner & drinks and we always had a great time. Then on flights through SFO I would go and grab some of their famous garlic fries. I'm sure my airplane travel neighbors loved that as was we flew to China. Recently we had a team dinner here at the Vegas location and it was anything but good. I am not sure what has happen but the food is just terrible. I know they brew the beer fresh but why can't the food be fresh too. I'm not sure how this place is going to survive because there is just too much good food out there to be wasted on this stuff. We ordered a ton of apps and they were worse then warmed up Costco samples. The sad part is that we were paying for these & Costco samples are free. If I was the chef that designed this menu, then I would be embarrassed to tell anyone I even worked on it. The visit here left enough of a bad taste in my mouth that I may never ever visit another one of these chains again. For my entree I ordered the tuna blue and it was the weirdest piece of tuna I've ever had. The colors were not vibrant at all. It was probably the saddest piece fish I've ever eaten. My friend & fellow Yelper kept saying, "Your fish doesn't look right!" I used his famous line on him saying, "Never order fish in a desert!" It was the only way I could admit to my ordering mistake. I was just trying to be healthy. Guess what comes with my fish as a side?  Garlic Fries! Because noting says raw fish side more then garlic fries. Not!!! The kitchen couldn't even get them right. There was not a single chunk of garlic on my whole dish of fries. In the past this dish would be so garlicky that you couldn't talk to people for days. Not anymore. They were basically French fries missing any of its past glory. How can a restaurant go backwards on one of their signature dishes? It just doesn't make sense. All I know is that this place doesn't care about its food anymore. The temperature of the food was not hot which meant my dish was sitting while the other 12 dishes in my group were being made. It's not cool to send back a dish when you are trying to eat as a team. My buddy Tony M got the beef medallions and he really didn't care for it. Another co-worker across from us cut up her swordfish and didn't even eat it. She said it was really dry. It's sad to have a group meal where the food is pretty much tasteless and inedible. I really wish we would have gone to another place. The only app that was halfway good was the Southwest egg roll but honestly anything deep fried is really good. Except for the deep fried crab balls which were really crabby. I don't like eating crab which tastes like the sea. These things were really fishy. In fact, if I threw it into the ocean I am sure a fish would throw it back at me. The fried calamari was also not really good either. There was nothing fresh about it. The rings were really thin and it was more batter then actual fish inside. Service was good. Our waitress did a nice job of serving us except she forgot to bring our chicken wings. I didn't get the bill so I'm not sure if we charged for them too. Hopefully another table enjoyed a couple of baskets of wings. I felt bad for one of the guys in our group. He didn't get his food until 10 minutes after we got ours. Which means the chef didn't make it or the waitress forgot to order it.  If you come here then just stick to the bier. It is the only thing that is made in house. The food is an afterthought and the chefs don't really care. Food needs to be made with love and passion but that is not going to happen here. Stay away from the food.

Review Text :
So, I just moved to the area and had a hankering for some Chinese food. What was a girl to do, but consult my trusty Yelp! app and see where it led me. Wel-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l......I must say this is the first time I feel like I've been led astray.You see, my go to whenever visiting a new Chinese place is a soup and a rice dish. I mean if a Chinese restaurant can't get that right then there's no way anything else I order is going to be any good. That philosophy hasn't let me down yet......hmmmmm now if there was just someway to apply that to relationships and I'd be a millionaire.........But, I digress..... back to the food. My no flavor won ton soup was full of ribbons of pork fat (no meat) that still had the veins running through it......blech!!! The house fried rice tasted like old pork, dried-out old chicken, old shrimps mixed with rice that had been fried up in at least 2 month old oil. To make sure I gave this place a fair shake I did refridgerate and attempt to eat the food the next, but to no avail I still began to feel ill immediately after.Now don't get me wrong. I believe all of the opinions about this place are true. But, I also think the lovely folks that live around this neighborhood must have iron-clad stomachs or they have been fed so much bad Chinese food it's been determined that this place is good. It's all relative????..maybe?????Unfortunately, the food I was served was illness-inducing. That's the only way I can honestly describe it.In fact, the following day I felt so sick after taking just a few bites of rice that, out of curiosity, I decided to check out the Dirty Diner report so I could find out if there were any Chinese restaurants around here worth going to. To my shock, but not surprise Ming Gee was at the top of the list for multiple violations. Many of the violations for things that would cause a person to have food poisoning. And that is why for the first time in my life I threw away $20 worth of food with no regrets.To add insult to injury I too was charged this mysterious 12% another Yelper mentioned in a previous post. Funny....when I took my total pre-tax bill and multiplied by 12% my handy-dandy little calculator showed I should have paid more than what I paid. Then I thought maybe they're taxing more the dish that contains shrimp, but even that did not add up. p.s. I waited a few weeks to write this review to see if any other reviews showed up. WHY???? Because there has been a big, fat CLOSED sign on the front door for at least the last week. So-o-o-o-o-o-o my question is how is it a few people have eaten at this restaurant in the last 2 days when the place hasn't been open within the last 2 days?.......hmmmmmm?????Bottom Line: I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone. You are risking your health by eating there IMHO. Also, if their doors do open again expect to pay a higher amount than whatever total you are given online or over the phone.

Review Text :
I WANT ONE IN LOS ANGELES.NOW.BEST PLACE EVER.easy going. great meat. fresh bread. juicy steaks. delicious. oh my childhood was awesome. i miss home.My mouth is open...insert cheesesteak please! I like this joint. I also like their sweet potato fries with coconut dipping sauce, mmmm yummy. You can smell the goodness just driving pass this place.Order to go and take your sandwich home to enjoy, That is the only downfall is it is on the corner of a busy street and there is only outdoor seating and it is always windy and the passing traffic noise and smell of cars whizzing by is annoying, tried this once for five seconds, was it enjoyable...not so much!Anyhow to order big so that you get full make sure you bring your largest wad of money, not exactly the cheapest place in town to get grub, for two of us to each order a large sandwich and an order of sweet potato fries and one soda. it set us back $38 bucks, seriously. Not the spot you want to hit up when you are low on cash and trying to grub. lolIn the worst of times people often think of the best of times.  Rex is no exception.  Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but "The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said "Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?"  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.Pops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!Apologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of "Happy Serum" to get up right again...what is "Happy Serum" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. Anyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.Lastly...the "Philly" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.  Here is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops. Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora and Pops...shame on you...you know better. Rex knows better. Rex deserves better. So does everyone else.I love Pop's! The cheese whiz is what I order with extra whiz and provolone (yep it is cheeeeeeezzzy) and onion. I am never disappointed. I love that they have "wise" chips as well.My husband can eat a whole sandwich and be satisfied I personally can only eat half then save the other half for later it is well worth the money. This last visit was nice because there was no line! Sometimes there is a line but it moves real quick. I recommend it to anybody that loves cheese steaks and all who think they don't.It is on a old school original A-frame wiener schnitzel and if it is your first time you can drive through the middle of the "A" but don't think there is a drive-thru to order food it is simply a place to get you back on the road you must park in the lot and walk up to the window.The "Mozzarella Sticks" and "Cheese Whiz Fries" are super yummy.You can sign up for their e-club and get coupons and deals.I have seen that they now have a food truck as well at a couple food truck events so give it a try!Pop's is fantastic! That sums up every experience I have here and what I have heard from everyone I know.  I LOVE this joint.  Ok, you probably want more info on it, so here you go:1. These cheesesteaks are big and tasty.  They are stuffed full of meat and toppings on soft, flaky bread. I've tried a couple and have loved them all.  My faves are the 3 cheese steak and the Mushroom and cheese steak.  Delish!2. Choices on top of choices! Steak or chicken, then 3 types of cheese, add in all sorts of veggies, and you have a lot of variety. You never get tired of the menu. 3. They have Tastykakes!4. Lots of tasty sides like Cheez Whiz fries, Fried green beans, chips, etc.  Gotta love the sides.5. The grill man.  I've been lots of times and it always seems the same guy is working. He is super friendly and knows how to cook.  He's just cool and deserves his own line. Pop's has been on this corner for as long as I remember.  The food is consistently good, the staff is friendly, and you will always leave with a full belly.  What could be better than that?!?!While there is no ambiance to speak of except eating outdoors in the heat, a mister is present, and the food is really tasty.  Changing it up a bit, instead of my usual Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich, this time I opted for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich instead, and was not disappointed.  While not heaping with meat, the roll was filled enough; smeared yellow mustard on the roll gave off just enough tang to the moist, lean pastrami embedded along with it; and the overall effect with a side of Fries was quite satisfying.  I will most certainly be back!

Review Text :
We tried Classic Italian Pizza for dinner last night.  We shared an appetizer of Aglio Olio and got two pies.  The appetizer was really good-the dipping oil is pumpkin seed oil based and has fresh minced garlic and a little fresh jalapeno for a bit of zing.  We could all use a bit of zing infused in our days, don't you think?I ordered the prosciutto pizza with kalamata added.  It was so good that after we got the check and my leftovers were boxed up I opened the box and grabbed another slice to scarf while I waited for the server to return.The four slices that made it home didn't even make it to see the next morning ;-(

Review Text :
This is Americanized Chinese all the way but ohmigosh is done right and done delightfully.Sam-Pan has been a staple of old downtown Henderson for as long as I can remember.  I grew up on this stuff.  It used to be in a pretty ratty old strip 'mall,' but in recent years its been cleaned up.  The food, however, has always been great.Unlike other Chinese places, everything here is made fresh and you can taste it.  The sauces aren't thick with glutens (hooray!) and fired dishes are crispy, not greasy.  They offer an array of vegetarian items and the staff is always attentive and helpful.This is one of my grandfather's favorite places to dine.  He loves Chinese food and has traveled the US extensively and this little place on Water and Pacific remains his forever favourite.

Review Text :
I will never ever go to Quiznos or Subway ever again!  Cheba Hut is definitely the best and most creative sub shop around.I had the White Widow sandwich on a garlic herb bun.  It came with chicken smothered in ranch, cheese, bacon,  and mushrooms.  I also added peppers and mustard and it was completely awesome.  Looking at the menu, I realize that really whatever I am in the mood for, they have.  I would give it -1 star for not having green chilies, but I will survive (and so will be esophogus)Prices are very reasonable and I loved it that I had the choice of an 8" sub.  My biggest issue with the likes of Subway is that I could only get 6 or 12" when all I wanted was something in the middle.I found a new love in Cheba Hut.  YUMMY!!!! And the decor ROCKS!!!!!"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Mother mother fuck. Mother mother fuck fuck. Mother fuck mother fuck.Schnoise, noise noise.1 2, 1 2 3 4 Schnoise noise noise.Smokin weed, smokin wiz.Doin' coke, drinkin beers.Drinkin beers, beers,beers.Rollin' fatties, smokin blunts.Who smokes the blunts? We smoke the blunts.Rollin' blunts and smokin um'"Uh Lemme get a nickel Bag"15 bucks, little man, put that shit in my hand.If that money doesn't show then you owe me owe me owe.My jungle love.Oh e oh e oh.I think I wanna know ya know ya ... yeah, what."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-xKUU5sWS4~Jay If you don't know, then you can't go!I got the Griefo and added turkey, it had Pepper Jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole,sprouts,lettuce,black olives, mushrooms,cucumbers, pickles and tomatoes and 1 very thin and dry piece of turkey. (see pics)While I'll admit it was better than Scrubway and Schizno's, it would have been even better if I was high. Since I don't smoke I'll let you all commence with your bogartin' and I'll have to cite all the reviews before me with a RUI (reviewing under the influence).I shoulda bought that nickel bag form Jay..........Damn stoners forgot to make my food!!! How could you do this to me Cheba Hut?? I've loved you for 9 years! I understand the argument of not being allowed to watch the flatscreen TV during work hours is an important one, but being that apparently talking to each other is too big of a distraction to not miss orders, I'm gonna have to side with management on this one.Aside from the literal temper tantrum I witnessed by the majority of the staff with regard to the aforementioned TV, screaming obscenities and all, everything else was pretty crappy too. I got a salad for the first time ever at Cheba Hut, specifically the Southwestern Chicken Salad, and boy oh boy was that a mistake!! After waiting 20+ minutes for my shitty salad, I am handed a bowl full of brown-edged lettuce with mayonnaise-based chicken salad looking suspiciously like it came out of a can scooped on top.  Nowhere did I see the spicy marinated chicken breast, salsa, and other southwestern accoutrement I was promised by the description.The manager/owner/person of authority came out at the last second to earn this second star by giving me a free rice krispie treat for my troubles, which was freakin' delicious.This broke my heart Cheba Hut, as I pretty much survived only on your Dank Nugs and Kind Pinners through college, but you did me wrong today. Get your shit together, get some fresh (preferably local) vegetables, and get the whiny, pre-pubescent boys out from behind the counter and I'll consider coming back.Until then, thanks to the god awful salad and non-service, you guys are cashed.Daughter was in town visiting and said lets grab lunch, my treat, and off to Cheba Hut we went, she wanted to "shock" me because she thought I wouldn't get it, haha. Such a silly girl.It was my 1st time there and after checking out the menu, I went with a pinner Jamaican Red. We ordered our lunches and headed back to the house.This was a good sandwich, it was spicy chicken breast, bell peppers, jalapenos, black olives, cheddar cheese and I added all the fixings such as lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles & there house dressing. The Jamaican Red had a little kick to it, which I liked, if you like things spicy, this might be the one for you, but I kicked up a bit too and added sriracha too, and that was the perfect touch!Can't believe I haven't stopped into a Cheba Hut before, but now I am glad I did and am pretty sure I will be back to try another sandwich soon.

Review Text :
My first experience with Filipino food..this place was suggested by a Filipino coworker of mine.   So we decided to give this place a shot after having more than a few beverages at the Freakin Frog.I got the chicken adobo which was very tasty...hard to describe the taste..almost like a garlic kinda gravy but the chicken thigh almost had a turkey quality to it..maybe it was the beer talking but that's what it seemed like and it was damn good.  For $1 extra, I got a beef soup and a bunch of mini egg rolls so the total came to $9.95 for a huge meal.  My wife got an awesome combo platter which included bbq pork, beef, chicken and red snapper (skip the red snapper if you go) which also came w/ rice and egg rolls all for $8.95!!  A steal!!  The setup of the place is pretty nice too.  Almost has an islandy/vacation feel to it if the front blinds are down and you're not looking at the cars going by on Jones :P  Super friendly staff that helped/suggested a bunch of different things for us to try too.Oh heck yeah I'm a fan.How can you go wrong with deep fried food?Rhetorical question.  Please don't answer that.There was an episode of the Simpson's where Moe decides to convert his bar to a restaurant and purchases a military grade deep fryer.In one scene, they show a complete meal (entree, salad, wine glass, flower in mini-vase all sitting on a tray) being lowered into this scalding hot vat of oil and coming out all crispy golden. That's what I had!And it was all good: fried chicken, fried pork, fried ribs, fried rice, fried fork, fried drinking glass, all served with a side of lechon sauce and/or banana ketchup.After my meal here, I had to eat salad for a week, but it was worth it.And once I've fully drained all this oil out of my system, I'm going back for more -- I'm talking at least a couple months.See you guys in December.Salo Salo is a great Filipino place to eat dinner with friends and family while in Vegas. They have plenty of seating, the restaurant is clean and they have good service and food. They also have good hours. Weeknights they close at 9:30pm and Fridays and weekends at 10:00pm. On a recent visit here, I came with a party of four and we ordered: kare kare (meat and veggies in peanut butter broth), sinigang soup (a sour soup with tamarind and meat), bangus (fried boneless milk fish), crispy pata (fried pork) and turon delight (banana egg rolls with Filipino ice cream). At the beginning of the meal, they give free garlic peanuts. This is always good and a nice start to the meal. (There are garlic peanuts for sale if you like the sample that they give). The kare kare was one of the first dishes served and I liked the presentation of the kare kare because they put this in a traditional Filipino palayok or clay pot. It comes out nice and hot and the peanut butter broth is perfect for topping off the rice. There was plenty of veggies in this in terms of eggplant and greens. The veggies and the broth is always my favorite for kare kare. I did notice their didn't seem to be a lot of meat in this though. (The veggies for me are the best part anyways). The sinigang soup was nice and sour and had a fair share of veggies and tomato. I liked sipping on the warm soup and it was also nice to top this on the rice along with the meat that was inside the soup. The meat they put in this though could have been a little bit leaner. The bangus fish they served was huge! I think our party only got through a quarter of the fish! The crispy pata was good. It was fried just right and was not to hard. It's good to match this with kare kare or sinigang. I also liked dipping the crispy pata in the vinegar dipping sauce that they provide. The turon delight was our dessert. Their turon delight is mini banana egg rolls (maybe about 8?) and then in the middle is some ice cream. The ice cream is a Filipino ice cream flavor - the night when we had it I believe it was jack fruit. This is one nice, sweet Filipino treat. I love all the traditional Filipino meals at Salo Salo and I also love how the whole restaurant has a traditional Filipino feel to it. They have decor that is very Filipino - Filipino paintings, wooden seats and tables. It is all prominently Filipino and makes a wonderful ambiance for enjoying a good Filipino meal.2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #4Salo-Salo was actually recommended by Roger T for us to go for our next Halo-Halo Challenge.  I admit, I pulled up Yelp, got on Salo-Salo's website, and did my homework on their Pinoy "Mix-Mix" dessert.  Based on their website, pinipig was in their Halo-Halo. Interesting...I gots to investigate.We arrived on Father's Day and this place was packed and there was a line.  Since we weren't having any food except Halo-Halo, they seated us right away.  Within 5 minutes, our Halo-Halo's arrived.  Each Halo-Halo cost $4.95 and what a beautiful sight.  First of all, real silverware. Always a bonus for me since it makes mixing this iced treat that much easier with real utensils.  Salo-Salo's Halo-Halo had what I've been looking for all along...real, legit ube.  Ube ice cream, green jelly, red jelly, some coconut, white beans, and flan were also at attendance.  But what was missing was the red beans, pinipig, and lanka. I was still stoked that I got legit ube. Taste wise...pretty damn good. Would be perfect if red beans made it to the party. PS:  We didn't have anything else, just their Halo-Halo. Service was fantastic, especially since they were so busy.Halo-Halo:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ#c0x5cS2wqTguAxEttK-iwg2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WAContender #8 (Fiesta Filipina):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-filipina-cuisine-henderson#hrid:VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHwMy sister in law swear to god this place kills all pilipino food around vegas. She has been here for alot of times now and this is first time coming in here. We already ordered when i found the news hee in yelp. :( it my fault i guess that i didnt check yelp before, I usually believe her when it comes to food. But this recent nrws really knock my appetite to the food. Yet Iam here to tell you that I didnt rate them because of the recent news (roach infestation.) Rather iam writing this rating with the same criteria I have been giving other food places.We ordered:ChopsueyPancit bihon And family set( includes ; bbq pork and chicken, squid, and arellanong bangus.RiceLets start with the chop suey. The vegetables were fresh and the flavor is there when it comes to the chop suey taste that filipino style shouls be but the chicken that came with the chop suey was dried up. So dry that we didnt touch it.Next the pancit, it was probably the one thing that i ate alot of on the bunch, it taste good, and has all the flavor i want frpm a pancit.Lastly the big family plate which contains different food, the beef bbq is probably the only thing that was near the taste that is near the standard of pinoy beef bbq. The chicken bbq was we only took 1 bite out of it, 4 sticks remained on the platter. The arellanong bangus was okay, but it tasted not fresh, as well as the squid, which i may add has only the bbq sauce on top of it, and smoked. I would have done better prepartion on it, no to mention , it tasted days old or refrigerated.Regardless of the ROACH infestation which we saw momenta before we eat, i find this place pricey with foods that are not as highly as other yelpers say.Maybe my standards of pinoy foods are high, but when a chicken bbq is so messed up that the bbq chicken that I make home made is way better than what you sell, then theres a problem. Lastly I would not reccomend anyone to eat here. I dont know if its true but they should have the GRADE C on their door, I may be wrong but its either they have never put it out, or they have been inspected again since January i cant find an update about the roach infestation.This will be the last time i will eat here, i took a chance to see if the flavor and taste are what the other yelpers said are true, even in the midst of knowing what might be back on that kitchen. Yelpers take this advice, and stay away, not unless you want be another brave sould to try out their kitchens delicacies.

Restaurant name  Swensen's Grill &  Ice Cream Parlor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Many years ago I worked at a Swensen's in California . I was thrilled to have such a fun job scooping ice cream. The memories of those days has made me crave my favorite ice cream flavor  Chocolate Peanut Butter, a flavor that used to be my rich sweet special ice cream treat friend. Well yesterday I surprised the kids with a trip to Swensens I actually thought it was closed for some reason.  The place reminds me a lot of the place I worked at same oaky dark brown wood, marble tables , many of the same flavors of ice cream. They stil have loads of rich toppings and combination of flavors  . The bummer is the flavor did not have the butterfat flavor of Swensen's of old. It was tasty , it was good but not earth shaking, and I like my treats earth shakingly good. It is a quaint place , good for taking grandma out for an old fashioned sundae, kids out for ice cream after eighth grade graduation  or stopping for a treat with your kids.

Their commercials are everywhere, but I had to go to Arizona to actually try some.It's not bad, but it wasn't that great either. I got the #5: a Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster with tots and a drink ($6.29). The burger was alright. The tots seemed a bit dry.Are we supposed to tip the waiters that rollerblade to your car window?? I think that was the first time I ever gave a tip at a fast food restaurant.It's been a while since I've eaten at a Sonic.  What drew me in was a coupon in the mail for 2 for 1 premium Hot Dogs.  They have a new menu of premium Hot Dogs and they looked very tempting, so I grabbed my coupon and headed for this location.I decided to order:Chicago Hot Doghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=aQgi3VN_Cj_GKf6BsuD8CANew York Hot Doghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=3vkk0sdl_Fv-soALmxy0lgCheeseburgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=xefpZG1PaZqwR9msB56xiwSince I'm a big fan of Chicago Dogs, I went for the Chicago Hot Dog first.  Based on it's appearance, it looked promising.....except the Relish wasn't colored Car Coolant Green like the real Dogs in Chicago.  I took a bite and was pleased.....it was "close", very close to a real Chicago Dog.Next up was the New York Dog.  It was OK, not as good as the Chicago Dog.The Burger was OK too......better than most fast food joints.The one weird thing about this restaurant location is that if you decide to dine inside, you order through a phone and someone from the back brings it out to you.....strange, very strange.Overall, not a bad fast food option.  Will come back for the Dogs again.  Gave it 4 Stars.....was really rounding up from 3.5.Return Factor - 77%

This is probably the best tasting and fastest Chinese food delivery available in old town Scottsdale. The portions are big, so split one dinner and one appetizer and you're all set. The house fried rice was a little dry but flavorful, egg drop soup is packed with goodness (not just broth), the pot stickers are freaking amazing, egg rolls are very good too with extra hot mustard. *Lunch specials are the way to go before 3pm.

Restaurant name  Dilly's Deli

Review Text :
For many years, Dilly's was my saving grace for a lunchtime option when I worked in Tempe. Although I could never escape the smell of fresh bread for the rest of the day, the quality of sandwich was worth the smell. Dilly's is a great deli if you need to get in and out in a timely manner while still being able to enjoy a decent meal along the way. Whether it's their salads or sandwiches, I am a fan of whatever they serve. Don't get me started on the sugar cookies. Those little bits of baking delight probably cost me a pound or two, but it was worth every bite. Any deli that serves fresh avocado gets a star in my book and not only does Dilly's serve it, they pile it on. The bread is always fresh (hence the smell) and the sandwiches are served with just the right amount of warmth to them. If you visit, here are my top choices:- If you like cream cheese and avocado, go with the Dilly Bird - Veggie supreme but add turkey- Honey Do if you are a fan of honey mustard - Greek Wrap - Clam Chowder Enjoy!

Review Text :
I am from New York so you know I am super picky about food and my 300 pound stature lets you know I enjoy my food when I get it. So when I say this place is like home, you know this will be food legends are made from. IMHO it does not matter what you order, you will enjoy the meal like no other before. Priced right & they deliver!Another Yelp success story!  I've been looking for a neighborhood pizza and wings place and finally found it!  I'm very particular about my wings and happy that they measure up!  The pizza is great too and the antipasto salad is just right.  Add delivery and Bruno's saves me from cooking dinner!Been here a few times and the pizza is fresh every time, the employee is very nice which for me is very important when eating somewhere. Nice that there are 2 tv's on different channels, best thing is I live in walking distance.This place is small yet comfortable for my nephew and I. Felt like we were at home watching the suns game and eating pizza.The owner was so nice. I had asked him politely if she could put on this end game, instead. She handed me the remote control like I was family. Haha. She said whatever you need let me know.  Thumbs up.I ordered the ziti mushroom pasta, Holy cow they put way too much sauce in!!! Which was PERFECT!!! :)) it also came with a house salad and breadsticks. If I knew, I wouldn't have ordered the vegetarian pizza. But either way, the pizza was fantastic :) minus rhe olives. .. ( I said no olives) :/ We'll be coming back. :))We got 2 xlg cheese pizzas, we went and got them and the pizza was the best I've had here since moving to az.  The dough was awesome and the pizza was even better cold. I love cold pizza. So over all it was a very good place totally recommend trying.

Restaurant name  Kyoto Japanese Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
"Real Japanese cuisine"  For all those that think Teppan style is authentic Japanese food I hope my yelp opens your eyes. Don't get me wrong I love to eat with a group of friends at Kyoto.  But know that the Teppan style cooking is an authentic tourist trap created by a chain restaurant owner in Japan.  The ReviewI like the Kyoto bowl for but a good Japanese food.  The chiefs create a great experience and atmosphere and the Sushi is pretty good.  I have eaten here a few times, and have had a saki bomb here or there. I learned the hard way how power full the drinks are so use with caution.Kyoto is an Old Town staple. It was there long before the endless miles of trendy restaurants, sushi joints and clubs. It was there when Devils Martini, Myst and Axis Radius were the "cool" spots to party and it was the place you'd visit for sake and Teppanyaki to get the night started right. But those are the days of yesteryear, the real question is: how is Kyoto now? Still chugging! So the decor isn't as trendy as some of the newer restaurants out there. So the building is a little run down. So there are cooler spots to visit at night. Who cares! Kyoto is fun, it has good food and the drinks are flowing and flowing...and flowing! I visit Kyoto when I want to sake bomb and enjoy fried rice that becomes a beating heart, a flaming mountain of onions, one heck of a fire show and of course hearty, decent food! Yes, it's cheesy but it's fun...especially when sake is involved!Kyoto is a fun spot for a group dinner when you want something lively, you want something close to the bars in Old Town and you want something that isn't too stuffy. Be warned, it gets crowded, so make a reservation or get there early.Kyoto continues to be a rockin' good time! Every time I visit, Kyoto provides an activity dinner experience! Between the saki bombs, the entertaining chef and the good food, Kyoto has the tri-fecta. Be warned that on the weekends, you will experience a wait, so it's best to call ahead and make a reservation.I've been to Kyoto a handful of times through the years... it's an Old Town Scottsdale staple.  Whether you're looking for sushi or hibachi; you're dining solo or with a group; you can find what you're looking for here, but you do have to choose between the sushi side and the hibachi side of the restaurant.I've been for both and neither has blown me away, but if you don't have extremely high expectations, this place really is A-OK.  Service is attentive and somewhat quick.  Prices are moderate, but if you're eating sushi, it can add up quickly!I do like Kyoto as it's not your typical Old Town scene; it's a bit on the older and more casual side, which I like.Some highlights from my last meal (and keep in mind that I'm pregnant, so I had to go with all cooked fish this time):-edamame-salad with japanese dressing-futomaki roll-caterpillar rollWhile I'm not rushing back, I don't think Kyoto is going anywhere, so I imagine I'll be returning eventually.  Remember, it's A-OK as long as you don't have high expectations.  Enjoy!

Review Text :
"Where should we go now?""I think Drift is nearby...have you guys ever been there?""No...where is it?"Let me look it up on my phone....it says its less than a mile away..."***5 minutes later...***"Um, where are we?  This looks pretty residential....are you sure this place exists?""The GPS says to make a left, let's just keep walking...""Are those....are those Tiki Torches?""They are!  Thank you technology!" If you didn't know where it was, there is no way you would know it existed.  I stopped in with Bonnie G, Erica O., and the Poop Guy after SMoCA and I really enjoyed myself.  We had a great little booth in the corner, ordered some very strong and interesting drinks that came in fun glasses, ate some yummy vegetable spring rolls, watched a drunk douchebag hit on the hostess (she's the hostess, she can't get away!), and talked about our television habits when we were 11.  The makings of a good night indeed.The kitsch factor is high, which is good because I love me some kitsch.  Dare I say, its also surprisingly almost authentic touristy Hawaiian.   Our waitress was friendly and checked on us often and the food came out super quick.  I didn't think that the DJ was that intrusive.  It was good people watching (not as good as other places in Scottsdale) yet surprisingly laid back.  I will say that they really should add Don Q to their "Exotic Rums" list.  That would have garnered them a 5 star review from me for sure.Drift can be hit or miss as far as the crowd goes, but I always have a good time.  I have been to Drift more times than I can count.  It's always the fallback place if my friends and I are not not sure what to do or if we are not feeling it somewhere else. Things I've been asked at Drift:-Man grabs my arm as I am walking by (not the best pick-up technique to begin with- randomly grabbing girls).  Grabber- "Hey, you like Grey Goose?"Me- "Um, yeah."Grabber- "Good, cause I wanna get you loose."Me- "That is the worst line ever."Grabber- "Really, it didn't work."Me- "Nope, you might as well have asked if I'd like a pizza and a f*ck."-Guy grabs my arm and forces me to punch his friend. (Again, what is with all the grabbing?)Me to guy I just punched- "Your friend made me do it."Guy who forced me to punch his friend- "Don't worry, he deserved it." I won't go into the rest, but he proceeds to teach me a secret handshake before I can get away.  Then, later in the night when I run into him again, he forgets that he already met me and does the exact same thing to me all over again (hand shake and everything).  He thought I was a genius when I beat him to the punch and already knew the moves.Random guy corners me.R.G.- "Hey what's your name?"Me- "Morgan."R.G.- "My name's Ryan and this is my friend, Ryan."Me- "Really, you're both named Ryan?"R.G.- "Hey, two Ryans don't make a right."Me- silence.  A smirk slowly forming on my face because even though it was lame, it was a little creative.  R.G.- "I have a million dollar condo down the street, wanna go back and have a drink with us."Me- "I don't think so, you could be a serial killer."  Then, I paused because I realized his arm was in a cast.  "Oh, never mind.  You're injured, you can't kill anybody."My friend walks up, probably sensing he needs to save me- "What's going on?"Me- "He wants to have drinks in his million dollar condo, but I said no because he might be a serial killer.  Then, I realized I could kick his ass because he only has one good arm."My friend- "What happened to your arm?"R.G.- "It doesn't work."Me/my friend stare blanklyMe- "What do you mean it just doesn't work?"R.G.- "Remember the whole Firestone tire recall?  Well, I was in a rollover and that is why my arm doesn't work.  I got a really big settlement, so wanna go to my condo?"Me- I have no words.(And no, I didn't go to his damn condo)  Yep, I have found true love and his name is Drift.So, an update with another fun conversation from Drift.Standing at the bar waiting for my drink, I turn to see some guy smiling at me and tipping his drink in my direction as if to say hello.Me: "What are you drinking?"Guy: "Beer."Me: (duh) "What kind of beer?"Guy: "Budlight."Me: "Oh...well, that's pretty average."Guy: "What do you mean average?"Me: "I mean common, I guess."Guy's friend: "I'm drinking a Blue Moon."Me: "Oh, that's not bad."Guy: "Well, fuck. I'm not rich."Me: silent stare I probably should have said something snarky back to him, but I just slowly side stepped away while giving him the 'you are crazy' look. The guy tried to talk to me again later that night. I told his friend that he was mean and somehow that escalated to his friend doing some sort of weird hand hold thing with me every time he walked by. It was like his hand raped my hand in order to make me feel better about his friend being weird. I don't know, I was a little drunk and it seemed so comical that I just went along with it. I also have to add that it is pretty easy to grab a drink at the bar even when it's crowded.  I never have to use the trick where I pretend that I am about to throw up so that people will move aside. Ok, I've never actually had the guts to use that trick, but I am sure it would work.

Restaurant name  Gus's New York Pizza
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I can't be any clearer about this: This was the absolute worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life.I understand the average review before my writing is 4.5 stars, but I simply cannot conceive of this idea. Somehow, after the first rancid slice, I was able to continue through almost two more slices before my disgust overwhelmed my hunger. I don't care if I'm used to great pizza in Chicago, there has GOT to be something in between...So after getting a flier on my door for this place.... loaded with large print coupons for enormous amounts of food for next to nothing prices, I had to try it.I ordered a 18inch 2 topping pizza and 20 wings for $13.  Sounds great right?  Came out to $15 with tax.  I thought to myself, swell deal, better than any pizza place I've ordered from.When the guy came to the door he said it was $24.  I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.The pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.  I'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!!!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!Due to my downtown Tempe location I've been getting flyers from Gus's taped onto my door for years.  A couple nights ago, I had a wicked hunger smack me in the face around 1am, so I decided to give Gus's pizza a shot.Gus's flyers all scream about online ordering, so I wandered to their site and thought I'd give that a try.  I noticed right away that next to their $1.50 delivery charge was a 49 cent "service fee."  Being a poor college student, I decided to skip the fees and just call in for takeaway.  I call, speak to some almost-unintelligible knucklehead, and order my 18" pepperoni, sausage, and garlic using one of the many coupons that have collected on my desk.  Knucklehead says twenty minutes and I thank him, chuckle at amusing youtube videos for ten minutes, and then make the five minute drive to guarantee that my pizza will be fresh from the oven.I hit up Delhi Palace a couple times a month so I know the location, but I had never been inside Gus's before.  I was immediately unimpressed.  Behind the counter was some mid-forties guido complete with slicked back hair and gold chain around his neck, and a couple of other guys who appeared to be trying as hard as they could to avoid working.I tell them I'm here, and guido turns to chump number one, whose job it apparently was to make my pizza. It turns out he hadn't done so yet, so he tossed it together, threw it in the oven, and told me it'll be ready as soon as it's ready.  I pay (using cash to avoid yet another fee), sit down, and listen to the banter between the knuckleheads behind the counter and the disturbing douchebag at the table behind me, who apparently likes women much shorter than him that he can dominate.  Mothers, watch your daughters.  No, not the ones at ASU, the ones in junior high.  My pizza was finally done after about 15 minutes of angry birds, so I took it home and popped open the box.  The toppings all appeared to be right, but the smell was off.  Who knows, maybe they use the magical ingredient that makes their pizza as good as all of the one-review five-star sockpuppets who have reviewed Gus's say it is, but no.  Instead, I'm eating bland crust, oversweet sauce, and some form of dried chunks of garlic rather than the fresh garlic I was expecting between my meh pepperoni and tombstone-quality sausage.It's important to try many things in life, but now that I've tried Gus's pizza I can safely say I'll never be back.  I don't care how drunk or hungry I may be, and how late it has gotten, Gus's is off the list.This place is disgustingly gross. Its so gross, its almost disrespectful, do they seriously expect people to eat this? Well, I guess they do expect dumb people to eat this, and the only people who are dumb enough to eat this I guess are the loads of ASU students in the area. Oh wait, it makes sense now, they are still in business because drunk ASU kids eat food from one of the few places that is open 24/7.Do not get chicken as a pizza topping, its breaded chicken. Pizza dough was gross, soggy, not done well. The sauce was super watery and tasted bad as well. We ordered garlic knots, and well, the same thing here. In fact, the garlic knots had no garlic, there was just some garlic sauce on the side and some marinara (tasted like crap). I think I had the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. I think frozen pizza tastes 10x better.Gus's is disGUSting. I think if you wanted to make pizza at home you'd do a much better job even if you can't make microwave popcorn.The people who run this place are straight up criminals. I grew up on the east coast, and I was pretty swasted one night and had their pizza at a friend's place and it reminded me of the NY style pizza back home. I tried them sober and while the STYLE is there, the flavor is not. If you want pizza with the aftertaste of a bucket full of bloody vomit, eat at Gus's. If you want cheese with questionable expiry, eat at Gus's. If you want stale crust, eat at Gus's. If you want the folks who make the Jersey Shore cast look like British Nobility at the counter to treat you like complete garbage while you're in the storefront itself, eat at Gus's. The last time I got pizza delivered from them, it took them the better part of 2 hours to get the COLD pizza to my doorstep a mile and a half away on a thursday night. When I got there, I tipped the driver generously anyway, even though he was clearly baked out of his gourd and the pizza was nearly destroyed(seriously, did he drive through a destruction derby on the way? is that why the pizza took so long?). I paid over the phone with a card and tipped with cash. He took it upon himself to tip himself AGAIN on the signed receipt line. So I ended up paying almost 40 dollars for their smallest pizza with all the surcharges and double tip. When I called to talk to a manager, I was told that there was "nothing they could do to refund the money" but that he would talk to the driver and let him know that "wasn't cool". Yeah. No. Straight up theft and credit card fraud ISN'T cool. I told the guy on the phone(who knows if it was actually a manager) that his response wasn't even remotely appropriate and that I would be calling my credit card company to do a chargeback. He back pedaled and told me to come into the store and he'd give me both tips back in cash. I told him to do something lascivious with whatever hellbeast gave birth to him.So should you eat at Gus's? Only if you don't value your time, money, health, dignity, or temper. You'd be much better off getting some pizza from Slices on Mill. Or Native New Yorker. Or NYPD. They all have the good New York style without all the garbage slathered on top. And for far cheaper.

Restaurant name  Nora's Italian Cuisine

Review Text :
Whenever I'm headed out to lunch with coworkers/vendors, and people are in the mood for Italian, two places come up as suggestions: Pasta Mia and Nora's.  I've been to Pasta Mia quite a few times and well...whenever these decisions come up I'm always rooting for Nora's.Now maybe it's because I grew up going to places like Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill, but for the most part I've never "craved" Italian food for the better part of my life.  Nothing against those two restaurant chains, I've had good family celebrations there, but the food never hooked me.  Well, my opinion of Italian is slowly changing after visiting Nora's repeatedly.I started out with fettuccine, spaghetti, etc. and all those other dishes that most places serve.  What really won me over was their Melrose Pesto.  I've had pesto before at other places, and there were times were I was gagging it down.  I'd given up on the green sauce, until a coworker brought back leftovers of their Melrose Pesto at Nora's.  I ate it the next day for lunch, and immediately knew that I had to try that on my next visit.  I was able to do just that this week, and here I am anxiously waiting for my next meal there.Also of note is the skill of the bartenders.  They make some well crafted cocktails, and outside of Downtown Cocktail Room, this is the only other place that I trust to make me an Old Fashioned.  Nora's makes it to my list of repeat eats.I've been here on quite a few occasions and I have to say that I've never been entirely enthralled by this place. The food is just ok, nothing amazing. The pasta is generic and not particularly flavorful. A little on the overpriced side as well. I enjoy the garlic bread, which is pretty good. I have had some very good baked ziti, so that's been the saving grace here. The service is ok, but I get irked at having to wait for a table here. There's always a long wait. There are better Italian restaurants in town and there are worse.* * * * *  Review # 250  * * * * *I had an eye opener within the past 24 hours.  I had heard really good things about Nora's from several different sources, and finally ventured out with Diane and another couple to find out for myself.  What I discovered was one of the finest and most consistent Italian restaurants I have had the pleasure of experiencing anywhere. Very good buttery and complimentary Garlic Bread?  Check!  A well-seasoned and very tasty, lightly floured Gamberoni Fritti with succulent shrimp?  Check!  A hot and tasty, complex cup of Pasta Fagioli with Ditalini Pasta, tomato pieces, and an abundance of beans?  Check!A fine House Salad with small black olives, tomato quarters, a light Italian Dressing, a pepperoncini, and crunchy greens covered with a dense coat of cool Mozzarella Cheese coils?  Check!Large and thin, nicely pounded medallions of veal covered by mushroom slices and bathed in a hot and welcome sweet Marsala Sauce?  Check!A large bowl of steaming al dente Spaghetti, sweet Meat Sauce, & toothsome Mushrooms?  Check! A comfortable, dimly lit ambiance, with an aroma of pleasant Italian spices that greets one's nostrils as soon as the front door swings open?  Check!And, excellent, attentive service throughout dinner service?  Check!It was one of those meals where everything pretty much fell into place like clockwork, with wonderful course building upon wonderful course.The only speed bumps encountered this night were a small piece of lettuce head core found on my salad plate; the restaurant being all out of The Republic of Tea Ginger Peach Longevity Tea; and no available gelato except Cookies 'N Cream.  Small blips all!   I look forward to an early return engagement!Since I last reviewed Nora's two months ago, I have been here twice more, and each time it just gets better and better.  Wonderful food smells of pizza and other Italian delicacies strike one's nostrils as soon as the front door is opened; the friendly service has remained generally excellent regardless who I was served by; and the food has continued to be piping hot and always delicious.  I now realize that the Veal Parmigiana is as good and tender as the Veal Marsala; the Garlic Bread is consistently delectable (my group of 4 polished off 2 baskets); and the Chicken Soup is on the same high plane as the homemade Pasta Fagioli.On my latest foray I enjoyed Antipasto Salad, and could barely finish half of it.  I look forward to eating the remainder later at lunch today.  Topped by chunks of fresh Mozzarella Cheese, folded over curls of tasty ham mixed with leafy greens, ripe wedges of red tomato, black olives, pepperoncini, and more, all coated with a dripping light Italian Dressing, beckon.The Chicken Soup, which I was smart enough to order as a bowl rather than a cup, contained thin lengths of chicken just as I preferred, mixed with cooked celery and pieces of tomato, swimming in a hot, very tasty chicken broth.  It took many tablespoonfuls for me to finish it all, and almost ruined my appetite.  But not quite!With considerable effort I also finished off a large cheesy and tomato sauce-covered medallion of Veal Parmigiana accompanied by smoking Spaghetti Bolognese with mushrooms added, as I had decreed.  Diane got a requested bowl of extra Alfredo Sauce to ladle over her Veal and Penne Alfredo at no extra charge.  Here one can have whatever the tummy desires!For good reason, Nora's will remain one of my several fine, go-to Italian restaurants in Vegas!I met friends from out of town for lunch earlier this week.  As always, Nora's did not disappoint!  There were 5 of us and we ordered a large salad that was enough to serve everyone at the table with seconds.  Ands, it was very good!I ordered one of their menu's "Lunch Favorites."  It was the penne chicken broccoli pasta with garlic and oil.  It was excellent.  One minus--there wasn't enough garlic taste for me.  One of the others at the table ordered a large pizza with pineapple and mushrooms--the pineapple being a first for me.  It was such a pity when there were three pieces of pizza left over and she couldn't take it home with her.  She was winging back to Canada the next morning.  I made the sacrifice and took one for the team.  I brought the three pieces home, had one for dinner, and have the other two frozen for a lunch treat!  Tip to Yelpers---go out to eat with out of town friends the day before they're flying home and you might get some take out for the rest of the week.I have been a fan of Nora's for several years and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking for good Italian food with a really good atmosphere and great service!Here's another Italian restaurant getting one of my few 5-stars. We three, finishing a trade show at the Mandalay, visited Nora's this past Saturday at 630p. It's a huge success with locals, and was jammed. Many locals were at the counter picking up "to go" orders. I made reservations earlier in the day, and we were quickly seated.Nora's was recommended to me by "The General", (Irwin Raymer), known from Animal Planet's hit "Tanked." Irwin came to our booth at the trade show, and after a short chat, we exchanged "deli and restaurant info", with me getting the better end of the deal. He recommended Weiss's for best NY Style  Deli, and Nora's for best overall Italian.Nora's is in the strip center, NE corner of Flamingo and Jones, West of the Rio hotel. You'll walk in the door, with the hostess station and kitchen straight ahead, the bar and one dining area on the right, and what I'd call the main-dining area on the left. We sat in the main dining area, against a wall in the NW corner. For three, and because I wanted to get "a flavor" of Nora's, we ordered with the intention of "sharing until we burst!" (actually, we didn't intend to over-do-it... but the food was so incredibly good, and huge portions!) We started with the Antipasto Salad Large, and Steak Bruschetta. For our entrees, we ordered the Crazy Alfredo, Frutti de Mar, Chicken Marsala Linguini, and Oso Bucco. Best description would be... hearty, enjoyable, flavors.  We also ordered indivdual glasses of wine and three desserts, which we also shared. The Cannoli, (the Sicilian pastry dessert, not to be confused with Cannelloni, the Italian large reed, cylindrical type of pasta generally served baked with a filling and covered by a sauce), was our favorite. The Tirimisu was very good, and the Cheesecake circle was good. But that's splitting hairs... as the whole meal was one winning item after another. Our server was Brice, and it was with his guidance, and my instruction that we wanted to "get a flavor of Nora's" that we feel expert now in working their menu. Over the years I've eaten at numerous strip restaurants in Vegas, but I much prefer the "off the strip" and privately owned restaurants, both for their more relaxed atmosphere, and their great food at reasonable prices. If Nora's were in a strip hotel, I'd venture to say they'd be giving every other restaurant a run for their money. It's that good! You gotta' add this to your black book of "off the strip" Italian spots..... It's a "No-Brainer"...........  "Botta-Bing-Botta-Boom!"After eating real Italian food when I went to Italy a few years ago, I became an Italian food snob.  Good Italian restaurants in Vegas? No such thing!  Until I came to Nora's.I got there before they even opened for the day and I'm glad I did as it got real busy around 11:30!  That's always a good sign.We got calamari which was tender and crisp.  I got gnocchi in Alfredo sauce which was creamy and absolutely fabulous.  We also got the rib eye sandwich with gorgonzola topped with onion strings and homemade potato chips on the side plus a basket of fries.  It had huge chunks of meat and the rich and tangy flavor of the gorgonzola complements the meat.  For everything we got, I only paid less than $40!The service was good.  Remember to check-in so you can get a free glass of wine.  The free garlic bread is great.  You can definitely taste the garlic which I love.I am writing this review as I enjoy leftovers from dinner earlier tonight. The Nora experience ...ahh where to start...From the moment you step into Nora's you feel right at home. The restaurant has this indescribable homey feel to it that just puts a person at ease. There are two rooms to the restaurant, without having made a reservation, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately in the room by the kitchen.Their ceiling is very unique and is decorated with Trinacria ornaments which is the symbol of Sicily. Our server was nice enough to give us a short history lesson...pretty interesting. The garlic bread...ahhh the garlic bread...I could probably eat three baskets myself. So thin, crispy, and buttery....ahh AND GARLICKY...so delicious. The first basket is free and every additional basket is 2.50...which is smart of them because it is just that addicting. I can see people going off on the garlic bread and call it a day. I ordered the Chicken Carciofi in attempts to be "healthy"....I figured that chicken breast can't be that bad for you...eh. The order is served with pasta, fresh tomatoes, artichokes, and capers. The chicken was so moist and the flavors were just MMmmmMm...perfect...not to salty and just right. Pretty much blown away at first bite. Very generous portions, which explains why I'm stuffing my face with pasta at 1:30am...Such a bad idea blaghhh...Body will hate me for eating all these carbs before bed.Friends got the rigatoni special and cheese raviolis which were great as well but I was pretty overwhelmed with my Carciofi to really enjoy theirs.We also got the calamari and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, but I wasn't really impressed with either.Really great Italian food at very reasonable prices without sacrificing service. Our server was very attentive and informative. I will definitely be back to try the crazy alfredo. It is probably a good idea to make a reservation next time to be seated in the main room.Guaranteed to put you in a food coma.I really hope that the hype behind this place is that it once was much better and people are latching on to the nostalgia. This was one of the most mediocre restaurants I have visited. We made reservations for 8:45pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. It is located in a small strip mall and would be easy to miss. We were promptly seated and that is when everything started to go downhill. It took ~15 minutes to even get acknowledged and place our drink order. Their gnocchi and pasta are not made in house. I am not sure what would compel someone to pay $12 for gnocchi out of a package when I can get delicious gnocchi from Trader Joe's and toss in some pancetta for $5. I opted for their Frutti di Mare ($21) which was linguini in runny arrabiata sauce with an assortment of seafood. The husband had their carbonara which ranks among the worst I have ever had in the states. I am not even comparing this to Italy standards. While two of the three members of the party were still eating, one of the people's plates got taken away to be boxed up. Awkward. The server ignored our table pretty much most of the time and then rushed us out at the end. I would not come back nor recommend this place. It is all hype.Finally.  After a good 6 years of knowing about this place, really ever since dining at the old/extinct location on Rampart/Charleston like 20 times, it was about time I came to the original.As I understand, they've expanded onto the original.  What used to be a pizza kitchen with 3 tables, went left, and went right, and now has 3 distinct rooms with 3 distinct different feels.  When reserving a table, make sure you specify.  The family room (quiet and better for families), the casual (still 3 tables, attached to the kitchen), and the ritzy (connected to the bar, very nice, and hip).  PS.  One little TV in the bar doesn't quite cut it.(1)  One free Sangria with Yelp check-in with 1 purchased.  A $7.50 value, giddy up.  Could be more fruity and less sharp.  (4.0 stars)(2)  Pasta alla Nora ($12.50) -- It has everything I wanted.  Pesto, meat sauce, eggplant, and pasta.  I added a meatball for $1.50, and it exactly fixed the spot.  Huge portion.  (4.0 stars)(3)  The Melrose with Shrimp ($17.50) -- a creamy pesto sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and medium-size shrimp.  A little heavy-handed with the sauce, but better than not enough.  (4.5 stars) The service was nice, but wavered between unavailable and forgetful.  Overall, this place just makes me happy.  It would totally be my everyday place if I was local.  For out-of-towners, if you are looking for an easy-peasy spot away from the strip, this is your place.Nora's Cuisine has been seen as Las Vegas's best kept secret since opening in 1991. I recently was let in on that secret when I was on West Flamingo with a strong craving for Italian Food. When I walked in I noticed the decor of dark cherry and textured paint on the walls. My first condo was decorated  similar so it felt very inviting. The limited seating also made for a cozy dining experience.We were brought some complimentary garlic bread almost immediately after being seated. The aroma from the bread was intoxicating but when I bit into the bread the grease was too heavy that I felt it on the roof of my mouth. I've had better garlic bread so I just moved on to the Caesar Salad. The Romaine lettuce was crisp and lightly coated with homemade dressing.  Honestly the croutons that topped the salad were much better than the bread and the Caesar dressing was perfect. I was torn between the Chicken and Veal Parmigiana so I asked the waiter his favorite out of the two. He said he preferred the Veal. When I can't decide sometimes I ask for the waiter's advice as a tie breaker but it doesn't always go so well . I'm happy to say this time the waiter knew what he was talking about! The veal was tender inside with crispy outer breading. It was served  over a tasty marinara sauce and topped with a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese. I also tested my husband's Baked Rigatoni which was made with a meat sauce, rigatoni, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. My impression at first bite was it was too salty. It tasted better the next day. On a sweeter note we had the Oreo Tartufo for dessert. It was a ball of cookies and cream ice cream covered with a hard chocolate shell. It was big enough to share and small enough where you wouldn't  feel sorry you ate it. It was sinfully delicious! Nora's is great place for date night or a family dinner. The portions are generous and the service is excellent!Great classic Italian cuisine!I used to work around the corner from this place and ordered out all the time because they had amazing spaghetti and a great lunch special and after a few years I ended up back here for a lunch meeting. Nothing has changed. The food was just as good as it always had been and the service is also always great.The one negative for me is the ambiance. It's a very plain looking place and there's not much to it. Once again this is a place I would love to makeover. The food is always key for me and service is next so I still highly recommend this place for classic Italian dishes. Some of my favorite items are the antipasto, chicken Milanese and spaghetti with meatballs.Las Vegas Review Part II of the "Losing Money, Spending Money and General Hubby Eating Freebies Back At Home Tour".Friday night in Vegas, it was my mom's choice for dinner and she is a Vegas local, so of course she didn't want to hit the strip, or have a buffet, or deal with the traffic and valet at the hotels.  Nora's Cuisine is a mid-size local Italian restaurant, that appears to be popular.  They had live entertainment, which I found to be ok, but definitely geared towards an older crowd (and hell I'm older now, and it was still too old for me!)  The portions are large but I found the prices to actually be on the high side.  Let me explain:  Italian food usually is larger portions and usually is on the cheaper side, excluding Northern  Region Italian and some pricier ingredients, think Marscapone Cheese, Veal and Fresh Seafood.  I ordered a fairly basic salad and spaghetti & meatballs, both really standard with basic and cheaper ingredients.  While both dishes were large, the salad was again, basic, could have used more mozzarella and other than a few olives, tomatoes and onion, was overpriced at $7.95.  Highlight of salad was the homemade ranch dressing which was delicious.  The spaghetti & meatballs was again large, but the 2 meatballs were more on the smaller to medium size and you were really left with quite a bit of pasta.  I did not detect any veal in the meatballs, and the seasoning/ingredients was not quite there, as they were not soft and tender and appeared to be missing the requisite amount of cheese.I found service to be lacking, I had to ask twice for a simple refill of iced tea and I also had to ask for parmesan cheese as a topping for my spaghetti & meatballs.  The waiter seemed stressed (too busy perhaps) but that's not exactly my problem, is it?  Side note:  My mother had made reservations, we were on time, but we still had to wait about 15 minutes.Overall I would recommend Nora's, but I don't know that I would make it a for sure Italian destination when I'm back in Vegas.Classy italian restaurant that'll knock your socks off.    Went on Sunday 12-20-15 at 6:30 with my yelpy friend Jamie P.  She was nice enough to make us reservations and the place was packed so I'm glad she did that! We had 4 adults and a baby in our party and the hostess threw a hissy fit because she said the reservation is for four....not five people...so we'll have to wait.  I was thinking can't we just pull up a high chair to the table?  The answer was no.  Ended up being seated about 7PM and no food on the table until about 7:40 but that's the *only* puny little complaint that I have.  $95.83 got us a small 4 Staggioni pizza, a margarita, a whiskey sidecar cocktail, an appetizer of clams, a house salad, a chocolate cake, two coffees, and a ginger ale.  The table and napkins are real white linen and the table is covered by white paper.  Crayola crayons were brought out for my boy which I thought was cool (none of that cheap-o Rose Art shit).  I originally wanted the Branzino but they were out :( *sad violin noises* The clams were hot and fresh and the menu says it comes with 12 but I swear there were at least 2 dozen in my bowl.  The menu says  "12 Manila Clams, Evo, Lemon Parsly" and I'm pretty sure that's not how you spell parsley and shouldn't it be "EVOO" if they are trying to say extra virgin olive oil?  Whatevs....it was $14.95 and the clams were hot and sweet and wonderful.  I only had one that was sandy but the rest were awesome.  The 4 Staggioni pizza had pizza sauce, sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, and olives.  The small was $15.45 and worth every penny.  I loved the puffy crust and I'm enjoying the leftovers today as we speak.  The chocolate cake must be ordered ahead of time (at the time you order your entrees) and was a steal for $6.50.  It is a rich, soft centered, Valrohna chocolate cake adorned by a vanilla sauce and pistachios.  Valrohna is a type of rich chocolate heavy on the cocoa side.  I absolutely loved this.  It's making my mouth water right now just thinking about it! With Olive Garden being the only other italian food I've experienced, this place blows it out of the water.  It would be a great place to take a date or family members that come here from out of town.  I liked it a lot!  And I liked the good company even more. *wink wink*

Restaurant name  Ruby Tuesday

Review Text :
It'd been years since I'd been to a Ruby Tuesday's before last month. And since then I've been three or four times. Is it that good? No, not really. I mean, it's not bad, not as bad you probably think it is, anyway. But it ain't great. So why do I keep going back? That's a good question. Because it's not cheap, either. Probably because it's close to work.I've been making my way through their seafood options lately. The jumbo lump crab burger - it's crab cakes on a bun. That's probably some kind of no-no on somebody's lo-carb diet. Fried shrimp, grilled creole shrimp, shrimp scampi... tried 'em all, and they're all the same - not that good, but not bad. An incredibly solid three stars.Oh, and they've got a veggie burger, which technically pushes them up to 3.5 stars, but I'm not in the rounding up kind of mood today.

IT AIN'T PRETTY BUT THE TACOS ARE SOMETHING ELSEWe must have been their big catch of the day.  One lady is munching on her two 99 cents tacos with no sides, three ladies were talking in broken Spanish about the restaurant while ordering nothing from the counter and visiting the restroom. And here we are waiting for our Chicken Taco & Chicken Enchilada for $6.50 plus a Chili Verde Plate for $7.75. Not to forget two large fruit drinks. Just in front of us is one of the help asleep (looked like he was recovering from the morning rush of released inmates) in front of the TV with Clemson playing at Maryland. BTW, across the street is the Henderson Detention Center, but no cops in sight. Do you get the picture ?This is not a fancy Michoacan restaurant by any means. If you really want to know how sparse, even a Taco Bell seems fancier. Roberto's would the opposite extreme. So don't complain about the prison cell ambience. It's a place to pick up your cheap meal and eat behind your desk or at home. Wonder if the inmates across the street are thinking the same?  LoLLoved my pan fried chicken taco and enchilada. Chili verde plate was exaggeratedly much too tasty as Yu-go chauffeur finds out later. He's drinking water like he had been lost in a desert without water for three days and nights.SRTS has another location on the south side of Lake Mead Parkway on the way to the Lake. Looking forward to trying their Tuesday only Breakfast Burrito for $2.99. The 99 cent tacos are available everyday and so is their Ground Beef Burrito for just $2.50. With all the construction going on at the gigantic Cadence housing development, it should be an early Xmas for that other location.

Restaurant name  Persian Room
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Not sure why it took me so long to try Persian Room...I've been hearing about it and driving by it since my move to AZ almost four years ago.  And I like Persian food.  But for whatever reason, I didn't pop my Persian Room cherry until just the other night!My aunt was actually the one who chose to eat at Persian Room.  It was a Saturday night, and our party consisted of six - four ladies, me, and my brother.  We had some drinks and appetizers at home before we went, so we decided to order family style and share.  Wise decision...Luciano was our server and provided us with excellent service along with the rest of the staff.  We ordered a (#10) Persian Appetizer platter to start, and it was perfect for sharing... it had hummus, eggplant dip, grape leaves, and a yogurt cucumber dip too.  We used the warm fresh bread to scoop it all up along with the fresh onions and Persian spices that were on the table too.  This could've been a meal in itself, it was all so tasty!Next, we shared a #20 - Chicken Kebab plate, a #36 - Vegetarian Stew (which had okra and eggplant and tons of other veggies that I like), and a #28 - Sultani mixed meat platter.  We requested 1/2 rice and 1/2 greek salads with the platters.This was just enough food for our group, although everything was delicious that had we ordered more, we would've kept eating for sure... instead, Luciano brought us out a couple of desserts (baklava and Persian ice cream) to share.  Mmmmmm - both were pretty fantastic!Total bill for all of the above + three glasses of wine was just over $100... not so bad.  I enjoyed my meal and I'm sure I will not wait another few years to return.  As a matter of fact, I'd be game to return in the next few weeks.  Great place for a family style meal + quick and attentive service.  See you again soon, Luciano!3.75First visit in years!  I could've sworn I'd written a review, albeit a year or two *after* my very first visit with Mom and her ex- back when I still lived in Chandler ('04), or perhaps even before that, in Maricopa (horrors!).  I remembered that he, a carnivore at heart, had the #31 Sultani,  while Mom and I shared the # 19 Chicken shish.  We also shared a hummus app.  I vividly recall thinking Persian Room's pita bread stupefying, and I'm happy to report it still is!It was a hard decision to make- what to have for dinner, after seeing "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" last night (go see it!!), but I decided I'd wait until I could treat Mom out for sushi and to go to PR, instead.  I tried to stop by for takeout on Valentine's Day, but my last minute decision, made after a public speaking class and a whirlwind two-hour writing session at the college library, was foiled when I encountered a packed parking lot, so I headed home instead.  It was easy to find parking tonight, and it was nice to see takeout menus waiting by the first set of glass doors (there are two), where I could comfortably read the menu before going through the second set of doors and place my order at the cashier/host desk.  The friendly female host took my order of Kashk O' Bademjan (app) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ#A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ and #33 Naderi (from the section of beef entrees) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA#GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA.  Note that "all entrees include basmati rice, pita bread, and a grilled tomato."  I asked how long the order would take to prepare ("about ten minutes") and proceeded up the stairs to the lounge to read my book as I wait.  Or so I thought...It was my first time up at the lounge, and it's cozy enough.  There are many two-top tables up there, in case you don't want to sit in the larger rooms downstairs, and the bar is comfortable enough to dine solo, or with a friend or two.  There is a TV for those who MUST watch sports as you dine with your companion or unfortunate date... As I've said, I was only going for takeout and was only up here to take advantage of the lighting, but silly me, I asked if PR offered happy hour, and sure enough, it does!  Monday to Friday, from 5p to 8p, happy hour discounts on beer and house wine ($4 glass instead of regular $6) AND a free app (hummus, hummus and eggplant, dolmeh, or yogurt and cucumber dip).  And so, I decided why not enjoy a glass of chard with the hummus I had passed on for dinner?  The pour was actually quite good, and tasty, and it paired nicely with the delicious sauce plate of hummus and a lone olive, topped with spices.  Hot pita bread followed shortly... I was blissful!  (Well, OK, I was very happy.  Yes, I was blissful, too, but that praise rightfully belongs to my lovely therapist at SWIHA!)The takeout took a lot longer than ten minutes, but I wasn't going to argue, not when I was already full from my app and tipsy from the wine!I hope to return more often!p.s.  I did get to try a few pieces of chicken and filet mignon (delicately marinated, yet flavorful, and so tender!), with saffron rice (so buttery!), and another large piece of pita bread to enjoy a bit of the eggplant app with.  The entree was delicious, yet I don't think it's worth $21.95 for take out (see photo).  I could see paying that while dining in, since I have to factor in service and atmosphere, but for takeout...?Ghaza aali bood, merci!p.p.s.  Struck me a bit odd that I saw a lot of Asians, instead of Persians, entering and exiting the restaurant.  A bit surreal, I thought, but it could've been the chardonnay... :)You definitely won't go hungry here!! The atmosphere was nice. The people were even nicer. It can be casual but you might want to put on something a little more special to dine here, plus it makes you feel good to dress up. The food was outstanding! The value to portion ratio at dinner is insane, I suggest fasting before eating here. You will get two large meals out of it. I was so hoping to try dessert after Yelps recommendations but I will have to control myself next time to fit that in. The bread is delivered to your table shortly after coming out of the oven & is warm & delicious. There were a few large groups that had laughter oozing from the tables which made it a fun experience. We can't wait to go again!I don't know why I don't come here more often.  They have a pretty good deal for happy hour.  Our last visit was for our International Super Club night.  I ended up coveting the dishes around me.  My hubby had the fesenjan, and it was really good.  He called it a persian mole.  Monica had a grilled chicken dish that looked delicious.  The tahdig was so yummy with all the hummus and baba ganoush.  I think their happy hour is until 8p.m. and they offer specials upstair on their drinks and appetizers.  I guess I need to make another trip to the Persian Room very soon.The Persian Room was the place picked for April's International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) and I have to say this place was amazing! After checking in with the hostess we were shown to our table, which was upstairs next to the bar, we were a party of 16 and we didn't take up all the room. Pretty nice sized place, plus when checking in the party before us was also another huge party of 13, so the Persian Room for sure can handle larger dinner parties, if looking for a place to take a group.Service is impeccable, Sultan and our servers took care of our table, every need was met, every drink refilled, you can tell they take pride in service here.1st brought out to the table was small plates with half an white onion sliced, fresh mint, basil , butter on it  and bread (pita) and I can honestly tell you, it was amazing, everything blended well together, and since I wasn't kissing anyone that night bring on the onions I say haha. Everything on the menu looks heavenly but for this trip I went with the Chicken Shish, thick chunks of marinated chicken breast grilled with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes and basmati rice.   The chicken was grilled perfectly, it was tender, juicy and full of flavor added with the peppers & onions and grilled tomatoes, this was outstanding, I ate it all! It was soo good!  But fair warning, portions are huge.   I truly enjoyed the company of everyone, the food and the service,  I have to say personally this was one of my favorite ISCUYE's to date, and will be coming back often to try everything on the menu.April 2014 International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) met here for dinner.  This was the anniversary of Monica O and I organizing the Yelp PHX International Supper Club and I'm so happy that we come here.  AFter a couple  of minutes, we were greeted at the front door and seated at an upstairs table - conveniently located next to the bar.  Kudos to the Persian Room for being THE restaurant with the BEST and most ATTENTIVE service in the 13 months that our group has been meeting.  We usually have from about 15- 30 people to attend.  IN this case, we were some place in the middle.  A large group that was waited on by 3 very attentive people.  I liked this - A LOT.  3 people helped to make things go more smoothly and efficiently. I can't say enough about how happy I was with the quality of their service.  In addition to our large party, there was another large birthday party in the downstairs dining room that was being seated at the time that we were being seated.  This is an awesome place for a large party.Their happy hour lasts until about 7 or 7:30(Insanely late), so I am pretty sure that most of us ordered more than expected because all of their appetizers are half price during the happy hour.  I ordered a very delicious Chicken eggplant borani as my appetizer and shared it with the table.  Several others ordered appetizers and shared too.  My favorite was the Yogurt and Garlic Dip.  YIKES.  That stuff was great.  Becca H ordered that and she was sitting right beside me.  I felt like a little kid sneaking someone's food.  I just kept dipping in her Yogurt/Garlic Dip.  (LOL - TWSS).I ordered a small side salad for my main course since the Chicken Eggplant Borani was enough to feed an army.  The side salad was just fine.  This also happened to be 2nd least expensive #ISCUYE!  I was happy with that.My return factor for this place is 90%.When I think of delicious and filling comfort food, Persian Room is one of the first places that comes to mind. I have eaten here many times over the years and the experience has never been anything but exceptional. It's not cheap but not overall expensive and the portions served are enough for multiple meals.I have had many different dishes but. A few of my favorites are:1. The hummus and eggplant appetizer served withy their fresh made delicious flag bread.2. Beef koobideh. My wife loves the chicken but I prefer the beef. It's a long piece of seasoned ground beef. Sounds boring but is absolutely amazing. I actually like it more then the filet skewer. Totally savory and mouth watering.3. The chicken barg. Simple dish but they manage to make chicken breast juicy, flavorful, and perfect. I don't often order chicken at restaurants but I crave this stuff.The nice part about this place is you can order combos of pretty much anything. Again, the portions are huge so we always end up having leftovers. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it...

so today my coworker trace was looking for a place to get lunch, carne asada was on the request. i quickly jumped on Yelp did a search for Carne Asada in our work zip code and low and behold El Yaqui came up and it was pretty close and had a glowing review from Angelo C. it was confirmed that this place is not on the street, but instead inside a market place. the carne asada burrito is delicious, grilled and chopped meat, seasoned right, with grilled onions and beans. wrapped up in foil to keep it warm with a side of lime and pickled carrots and a salsa. from what i can tell from the beans in the burrito, they are awesome. lardy and smooth just the way they should be. 1 million calories later... I'm in carne asada coma now. if your in the area, or work around here. check this place out...

Never having Carribean or Jamaican food before, I was interested when a coworker mentioned that he went to this place and enjoyed it. I went today with him and a few others to give this place a shot, and we were all quite surprised.  I didn't really expect it to be so good.  I ordered the Goat Curry with Jamaican Roti, and the Sweet Potato Pudding for dessert.  I have yet to have a goat curry that I have really liked.  The dish in general always seems to be served with a sweet yellow Indian curry, which I'm not a huge fan of.  This curry was different.  I loved it.  It wasn't sweet at all, nor made with coconut.  It had a perfect spicy flavor without going over the top.  There were little potatoes in it, along with very tender and moist stringy goat meat.  The roti was amazing... very flat, floury bread with a little bit of spice cooked into it, perhaps from a curry.  I dipped it in my curry sauce, and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  There was also a little coli flower salad that came with the dish, and a whole wheat bun.  The Sweet Potato Pudding caught me off guard.  I didn't really taste a lot of sweet potato in it, but did taste perhaps a little rum or something like that.  It had raisins in it too, and was more of a little pudding cake.  It was quite enjoyable, but after all of the food that we had, i just couldn't finish it!  We also had some of the beef and chicken stuffed patties.  You HAVE to try the beef patties.  They are spicy with shredded beef stuffed inside a layered pastry.  Just deliciousness.  When I come back, and I definitely am, there is simply no way I could not order one of these on the side.Personally, I think the reviews on this place are low.  The ambiance isn't much; it fees like a mom and pop diner.  The staff offers adequate service, but isn't overly friendly.  The place is just very casual.  However, I think the food is quite a bit above average.  The prices are slightly high, but if that bothers you just drink a water and don't order any extras.  The food is worth it.  I don't really like sweet Indian curry, so this curry has me hooked!  I can't wait to try the ox tail!I'm part Jamaican, didn't ya know?  Well, not really, but my best friend since the 7th grade is Jamaican-American and her house was practically my second home growing up.  Her huge family is like my family and I've traveled to Jamaica with them three times, so I do know a little about the food.  Guess where my second family likes to eat when they're in Vegas?  Yeah, mon, Tasty Island, so you know it has to be good.  My girl was in town with some of her clan this past weekend and they wanted to have lunch here so we did.  I always get the oxtail with rice and peas and a slice of plaintain, washing it down with Kola Champagne (best soda ever)--oh yeah!  I had a beef patty as an appetizer and that thing had a slight kick-it was fresh out of the oven and it was a little spicy hot for me.  I can't do the jerk chicken because I'm too wimpy for the spicy, but my son had it and he ate it up (he's also almost Jamaican by default).  He usually gets the curry chicken, but they were out.  Service here can be on the slow side while you wait for your food, but that's why you should have a patty in the mean time: they have beef, chicken, and veggie patties, which are pastries with your choice of filling.  Some dishes are served with festival, Jamaican dumplings, and I tried my friend's, but it was kind of dry.  Other than that, we had another great meal here.  Everyting irie at Tasty island, mon!There's nothing like homestyle Jamaican cooking! I don't think there's a lot of Caribbean food places in town, so it was cool seeing this place in a shopping center near my house while doing errands. The service was more on the slow side, but I think that the wait was worth it. The people working here were really friendly, too!The interior was a little dated. There are tables and booths, but it didn't really have a set layout. When I arrived there was no music playing, the TV wasn't on, and the patrons dining in were super quiet. The silence was a little unbearable and kinda made the experience a little more awkward (especially with people lining up behind me). Thankfully, a younger gentleman, who I'm assuming worked there too, turned on the TV so that the room wasn't filled with the uncomfortable silence and the steady hum of the refrigerators. I ordered the the small size jerk chicken and a side order of plantains. The jerk chicken was pretty great! From what I remember, if you don't cook jerk chicken the correct way it gets rubbery and hard -- borderline inedible. The jerk chicken here was tender and juicy, with a nice chew to it.  The seasoning had the perfect spicy kick, which was enough to make me sweat a little. (Keep in mind that my tolerance for spice is a little lower than everyone else's, but that's what makes Caribbean food desirable -- the spices!)The rice and peas (beans) is the best thing to go with the jerk chicken. It also had a good Caribbean spice to it, so it will really give you a mouthful of unique  flavors if eaten with the chicken. Yummy!The plantains weren't like the plantains I'm usually used to eating. These were more like long, slender slices of ripe plantain fried to golden brown perfection. They had the perfect texture and they're on point with the sweet, caramelized homemade flavor.I didn't really like the beef patties here. I think there are other better tasting ones out there but until I find a good place in Vegas, this place will have to suffice. The food here definitely has a personality of its own. If you're a spice fanatic and are down to taste the flavors of Jamaica, then give this place a try!

I don't know if this place change ownership, or if some of these yahoos have selected the wrong location for the review. this is one of the best small and independent fast food chinese food restaurants in Phoenix.  I and my family and friends are regulars. it is ridiculous that some people believe that they are able to assess a place in a single visit just because it wasn't perfect.they are friendly, the food and vegetables are fresh and hot, and the prices are great. want-to-be food critics need to realize that no restaurant or magazine or television food critic evaluates a place good or bad in only one visit. this is a five star place for the type of restaurant it is.. I encourage anyone who has only had one visit, especially if it was two or more years ago, to either revisit or I hope that the intelligence of the reader is able to discern the difference. I love new Asia kitchen

Each Saturday, there's a limited serving of Japanese noodles from ramen to udon to whatever. It's fresh and authentic. I have eaten ramen all over Japan, SoCal, NorCal and throughout the world. Trust me on this!So this place is not a restaurant, by the way. It's actually a small grocery market that they set up some plastic chairs and tables in the corner of the store. You can actually buy bento boxes or other food items or drinks and sit down to enjoy it. It's a local Japanese grocery store!Ok, but back to the ramen/udon. Each week, you can check on their facebook page for the noodle bowl of the week. You come in and order and there's really small staff in the back preparing your food. Everyone in there is Japanese and speaks Japanese. I actually sat with these two old Japanese ladies that came in for ramen and we talked about Japan and AZ when they first got here in the 1960s. That was awesome.Like I said before, it gets pretty packed and they run out of noodles usually in an hour. Come early and eat the delicious food. You can walk over to the freezer and buy yourself a Japanese drink too. Afterwards, you can go next door to the Japanese bakery and get dessert.There's really no other place like this in the Phoenix area so come try it out.

What a gem of a diner.  It's a total throwback and the people working here make you feel right at home.  I bet it's easy to become a regular after just one visit.  The menu is so diverse and full of everything you could want from a diner.  I tried the Coney Island Dog because I'm the only one I know who's actually heard of coney dogs and I so miss them.  It was pretty good, but how could you possibly mess up a hot dog of any kind?  My friend had some green chili omelet thing and a side of biscuits and gravy.  Mmmmm, some seriously good diner food!The best part was our waitress.  She ended up reading our astrological birth charts right there at the table, just for fun.  She had the kinda personality that makes diners like this special.  If you're in the area and want a laid back, no BS kinda place to grab a bite, try Jim's Coney Island.  I only wish they were open later because this would be a great late night spot!Do you like it when you sit at the counter in a diner and the waitress calls you "Hon"..."Sweetie"..."Darlin' "? I know...I do too! It makes me feel like I've stepped back in time, to some mis-remembered past that probably never really happened to me (I may have watched too much TV many years ago...in fact when I walk into Jim's Coney Island, it seems to be in black and white, to me:) After my workout today, I was looking for a good place to retox:) I hadn't been to Jim's in quite a while, and this seemed to be a good time to get back to the lunch counter at Jim's:) Jim's throws the love at you...in any other hands this stuff is just regular diner fare...you know, the blue plate specials...the patty melts...the ham and cheese sandwiches...the clam chowder from the big white one gallon can...the frozen chicken fried steaks...you know, just good, solid diner food:) But, when they call me "cutie" as they serve my coney island and fries, it just makes everything...better:) What can I tell you...I'm a sucker for flattery:) That's not to say that Jim's serves crappy food and makes up for it with flattery...in fact it's all very tasty (including the actual coney island hot dog...not chili dog...coney island hot dog:)...but it's not really special food. So, what is special about Jim's? It's the atmosphere, ambiance, the nice people, the varied and eclectic menu and specials (Liver & Onions, Greek Feta Salad and Bacon/Avocado Omelet, all juxtaposed on the specials menu today, along with the normal 100+ items on the regular menu:) About the only thing I would add to Jim's, would be homemade pie...a lunch counter like this needs 4-5 great pies, so I would have a place to go and have a cup of coffee and a piece of banana cream pie...but that's a quibble, not a criticism:) Jim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch, next to Hugh Beaumont, and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch, served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me "good lookin":) Even if it never happened, that's how I remember it, Hon:)My first meal at Jim's was over four years ago... i went to lunch with my friend Tom. It was love at first sight... (not with me and Tom; with me and Jim's!)  Jim's reminded me of the old school diner types of Coney Island restaurants I grew up going to in Michigan.  I had a tasty Greek Salad, warm pita bread, great service, and while Tom picked up the bill, I remember the prices being moderate.  All that and it took me approximately four years to return.But I finally made it back to Jim's today... and it was just as good, if not better, than I remembered!  As a matter of fact, I may just add Jim's to my rotation for favorite lunch (and breakfast) spots in town!Here's why:*Excellent service! Della was our waitress and she was awesome... she was patient with our party of four, she joked around with us, got our orders right, kept our drinks filled, and had an amazing looking green studded belt on to boot!*Excellent food with lots of choices! You want breakfast food? They've got it!  You want salad? There are several choices! Gyros - sure thing... and if you get a sandwich, you get your choice of sides including cottage cheese, french fries, apple sauce, tomatoes, and more!*Moderate prices and large portions!*Old school decor!*Comfy booths!Thanks for sharing a fun lunch with me today, Brandon, Blair, and Lindsey... and glad I beat you to reviewing Jim's!  Let's do it again soon!

Review Text :
First visit 3 stars, second visit 2 stars unfortunately.  I don't doubt the pasta is still A-OK, but I have to knock them down for their entree-sized salads.  I ordered a Caesar with chicken.  The addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to $12.95.  While plentiful, the romaine was so drenched in dressing, the crispness of the lettuce was lost.  The chicken was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.  A shame because the dressing was pretty good.My husband ordered the Antipasto per Due.  With back olives, artichokes, ham, salami, provolone, and anchovies, it should have been a hit.  But again, drenched in vinaigrette.  Also the meats and cheese were just thin slices, nothing of exceptional quality.  At $14.95, this was a miss.We also ordered bruschetta, but I had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed "sub rolls."  Better bread is a must.  While I might consider Lo Cascio again, I'll stick with pasta.  If you see me carry a duffel bag inside, I brought my own baguette, too.A Tale of Two Pizzas in Scottsdale, Part II. . .. . .well, this is in north Tempe, but close enough.Grrr.I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, where you can find good Italian restaurants all over the place.  I'm also Italian in heritage.  I have been eating and cooking Italian food for much of my life, and I know what it's like to mix ingredients in the right proportions to make a pasta sauce that needs at least five hours simmering time to taste just right.  I had passed Lo Cascio's many times on my way out of Scottsdale back to Tempe, and looked at the building with some anticipation--it looked a lot like some of the old Italian places that I grew up near.Recently, I finally took my family out to eat at this place.  Upon walking in, I noted the distinctive decor on the walls that told me that this place specialized in Sicilian cuisine, and I was looking forward to that characteristic taste.  I ordered a pizza, remembering the taste of the very thin and incredible pie served to my father and I in Naples a decade ago.  I'm aware that Naples isn't in Sicily, but I was looking forward to real Southern Italian character to my dinner that night.  My wife ordered an eggplant parmesan, and my daughter opted for a simple cheese ravioli.I was aware that my pizza was likely not going to have the same depth of flavor as the astounding one that I ate in Italy, but I was expecting something authentic and delicious.  What I got served to me was a f*cking frozen pizza--not even a name brand like DiGiorno's or Tombstone, but something on the level of the cheap, bargain frozen pizza that you find on the bottom shelf of the supermarket freezer.  You know, the one that's 2 for $7?  It was putrid.  Now, I have to admit that I have no proof that the pizza I got served was frozen, but I've had enough cheap pizza to know that bland, cardboardy taste.  Totino's tasted better for over $12 less.I ordered a salad too--$5 for a handful of iceberg lettuce with two hunks of tomato and two god-damned olives.My wife's eggplant parmesan was nothing special,  She ordered mixed vegetables with it.  Fresh?  Nope--Bird's Eye.My daughter got served what I refer to as the "Italian Scam"--seven cheese ravioli in low-quality tomato sauce for $15.  Many Italian restaurants pull the Scam on you, because most of us are gullible enough to buy the bullsh*t that a plate full of noodles and sauce should be expensive because it's "I-TALYAN."  This just topped off a bad experience for us.Good parts?  The bread wasn't "authentic", but was yummy and loaded with sesame seeds.  Service was fantastic, but that wasn't enough to save this place.This place was an insult to Italian cooking in general, let alone Sicilian.  I don't care how many maps of Sicily they have around or how many triskelion heads they put on the walls and the menu, this joint ain't "Sicilian" in any meaningful sense of the word.  Lo Cascio's made this second-generation Italian-American very angry.  There are good pasta places around the Valley, but I would avoid this spot at all cost.I just received a "compliment" tonight under the "You're Funny" heading from an individual named Leonardo M. concerning my review for this restaurant.  The "compliment" stated in whole:"I guess your review was meant to be funny. Frozen pizza and Birdseye frozen vegetables? Iceberg lettuce?Italian from San Francisco? You may have been in Olive Garden or better yet Buca di Beppo. My mother is from Naples and my father from Sicily. We've spent time in both places. Maybe Italian food in SF has been too Americanized over the years. Sorry you had a bad experience?"This Leonardo character has no reviews, no Yelp friends, and just started on Yelp this last September (2013).  A person with such stats wouldn't have any business or interest making a comment like that to me unless he was the owner, so I'm going to address this "compliment" to me as if I came from the owner.So, no Leonardo, I wasn't trying to be funny.  Yes, I got a warmed-up frozen pizza for my entree and a tiny salad composed of iceberg lettuce for an additional $5.  My wife's mediocre meal had tasteless frozen vegetables on the side.  That's not funny.You know what the sad thing is?  You didn't even try to make it better.  My family and I get one of the worst Italian meals of our lives, and all you felt motivated to do was insult me and my taste in food.I grew up on restaurants like Westlake Joe's in Daly City, Bertolucci's in South San Francisco, Banchero's in Hayward, and a host of incredible Italian cooking from the North Beach area of San Francisco itself.  If you went to the owners of these restaurants and told them that their food was "too Americanized compared to yours", you would either end up with a spiffy pair of cement shoes, or at least with a horse's head on your pillow next to you the morning.  Okay, NOW I'm trying to be funny.If this was just an off night, and you wanted to show me how good your food really was, you could have seriously apologized to me.  You could have invited my family back, served us up a wonderful meal, and I would have been back here on Yelp telling everyone to never mind about the previous bad review.  I would have been HAPPY to do that.But no, you decided to insult me instead.  That's a shame--far more of a shame than just serving me a bad dinner.  All I can say now is that it appears that bad taste goes far deeper in this restaurant than just the food.UPDATE 1/30/14:The morning after I put up this review update, I received two more "compliments".  The first was by a man named "Robert K." from Chandler, someone who has no Yelp friends and about 40 reviews, who thought enough about what I wrote above to call me a "butt-hurt little child" at 6:27 am.  A response from Leonardo came about an hour later (and his name mysteriously changed to "Leonard").  He claimed that he wasn't the owner--just a "patron for several years" who never had that kind of experience at Lo Cascio's.  I won't buy that story any more than I'll buy food at this restaurant again.UPDATE 12/6/14:By this point, I have received a total of  five messages, "compliments", and even a counter-review, all negatively responding to this review and its previous incarnation.  Apparently back in September of 2013, another reviewer named "Denton S." from Tempe wrote a review for this restaurant where he called me a "condescending jerk", reacting with outrage because I had the temerity to call the bread "not authentic."  Again, another sock puppet Yelp account--one review and no other Yelp activity.  Thankfully, the review went straight into the "not recommended" section.  Another communication I got even seemed to imply that I had some kind of deep-seated anger issue, and with a "namaste", tried to tell me that my bad review was somehow harmful to my emotional and spiritual well-being.Phew!  Look guy, I don't give bad reviews because I'm mean at heart--I give them because a business gives me bad service or a bad deal for my money.  You gave me and my family a sucky meal for $60+ bill, and for the past couple of years, you and/or some friends of yours have been finding ways on Yelp of insulting or belittling me because I gave your business a one-star review in return.If my negative review were the only one, it wouldn't mean much.  However, my bad review Is one of a number of them from some quite upset people who disliked your food, your service, or both.  That's not my fault--it's yours.  Bad reviews are feedback telling you what you are doing WRONG.  It's supposed to tell you where  and how you can IMPROVE what you are doing.  Instead of doing that, you send me multiple messages calling me a jerk and a tool.  You sent it to me, and now I'm posting about it here for all to see.  Hope it's been worth it to you.

Review Text :
Yum, Yum, Yum.It's spicy, so wussies take note. I LOVE their blue corn enchiladas.... they're served on a big plate and all the sides run together and you can't tell what is what... MMM!Their chicken enchiladas are also top notch.Yum.Highly recommended, especially for those with taste buds of steel :)The type of cuisine at Carlsbad is officially considered 'Green Hash Chile New Mexican Style.'  I know this because we asked the bartender as we sat pondering the menu.  This was my first visit to Carlsbad Tavern, and it will not be my last.I went with a house salad and will agree with Rick S in recommending it with their jalapeno ranch dressing.  Either it was really good or I was really hungry, but I digress!  For my entree, the lobster enchiladas were completely satisfying - especially once they brought out a side of guacamole per my request.  Jared had the carne adovada plate.  (I guess he gets that every f-in time he goes there; i don't think he's ever had anything else!  Guess he likes it!)  No desserts or drinks this visit, but I'm sure we'll be back for more... although the mints on the way out were great!  (And for those curious about the price, our bill was $36 before tip).We noticed they serve a Sunday Brunch - Bloody Mary Bar as well... sounds good to me; especially once we move to Old Town and won't have to worry about drinking and driving!Friendly attentive service at the bar, and many more menu items I am excited to try.  Until next visit, Carlsbad Tavern...Carlsbat Cavern, or rather, Carlsbad Tavern, is a campy New Mexcian restaurant/bar that was the "ethnic" concession made to me by my parents after pleading to go to at least one regionally appropriate restaurant during my visit.What do I mean by campy, you ask?- Stuffed animal bats on the ceiling. As G.O.B. from AD would say, "Come on!"- Newspaper menus headlined "The Daily Guano"- Bat sauce: a Habanero-based hot sauce that was mild considering the base- A cave-themed interior, a bar area, and a decorative pool/moat exteriorAfter I assisted my sheltered family in translating the "unfamiliar" menu, we consumed:- Nachos (~$6 on HH, normally ~$9): Chips were a bit light for the heaping toppings- Lobster Enchiladas (~$16): Disappointing - slightly bitter and not much taste overall- Chile Rellenos (~$11): Peppers stuffed with pork and cheese, tasty but a bit heavy- Green Chile Mac + Cheese (~$6): Standard with appreciably subtle pepper flavor- Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7): Too much cake and too much sugar, not enough cocoa- Chocolate Eruption ($7): A "cake" with hardened chocolate mousse and cheesecake chunks; better than the aforementioned but still overly sweetOn happy hour, for a meal made of discounted appetizers and ~$4 margaritas, I could see this being a fun choice, but skip dinner (even though admittedly I am compelled by the ample outdoor moatside seating and the Habanero burger replete with medical warnings.) While I don't feel I wasted my restaurant selection, I also don't feel I prospected and struck pay dirt in Carlsbad Tavern either and I'm sure gold is out there.My husband and I went to Carlsbad last night. It really is one of our favorite places. We typically sit at the bar..alright, who am I kidding? We always sit at the bar. Why? Because the service it outstanding. Matt & Jacob were working last night- we always have such a great time with them. The conversation, the drinks, the food. It's like our home away from home. My husband had the Surf & Turf and I had a bite of the filet and the shrimp and both were supremely delicious! The filet was cooked to perfection and smothered in shitake mushrooms. To. Die. For. He ate everything on his plate. I thought he was going to lick it clean. (Thankfully, he knows better).I'm dieting. I had a salad with no dressing and ate the whole thing. Really. A salad with no dressing and I still ate it all! Plus they didn't roll their eyes when I brought in my diet tonic. And believe me, I deserved at least an eye roll.This is what I really wanted to share with you. During the month of September they have 1/2 priced food items from their late night menu. 12AM - 2AM Sunday through ThursHALF PRICE! The sliders were already a screaming delicious deal and now they're half off.  There is a God and he loves me! Loves me to eat  Half price Sliders. AMIRITE?!Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this bar a try one night in Scottsdale.  It was one of a few that were open late on a mid-week night and looked appealing.  The restaurant/bar looks like it can be hopping on busy nights, but on this particular night (Wed), it was slow.I saddled up to the bar and asked for a menu.  I asked the bartender if they had any IPA's and he suggested the Odell brewing company IPA.  I went for it and asked him what he would recommend I try.  Since  it was considered 'late night', there was a special menu and he suggested the Pork Loin Sliders (3 Sliders with Pepper Jack, Poblano Serrano Mayonnaise, and Tortilla Encrusted Onion Rings).  It sounded awesome, so I went with it.The IPA was really tasty and hit the spot.  After a few minutes, the Pork Loin Sliders came out.  I spread the Poblano Serrano Mayo on them and then for fun added some Fries on the Sliders.  I took a small bite out of the first Slider and it was awesome!  The Pork Loin was moist & juicy and the Poblano Serrano Mayo was the perfect compliment....adding a nice bite to the flavor.  I devoured the Sliders within a few minutes and then sat back and enjoyed the rest of my IPA.I really enjoyed this place and would like to return on my next trip to Scottsdale.Hidden gem alert! If you've ever driven on Hayden, traveled north from Thomas and passed by Carlsbad Tavern without stopping in, you're missing out! This is a charming little eatery complete with twinkle lights and a huge moat-like water fountain that surrounds the patio. The atmosphere is casual and perfect for large groups. I celebrated a birthday here several years ago and have been for dinner several times. The interior is cozy and feels like you're truly in a cavern and the patio is charming with the sound of water while you eat under the twinkle lights. It's perfect for a casual but ambiance-filled date night, perfect if you have young children and need a place that allows noise and perfect for any sized group. The food here is New Mexican and has a serious kick to it (in a good way). It appears that you must ask for salsa upon request. The salsa is very chunky and decent but the tomato chunks can make it hard to dip chips. The nachos are made with chipotle chips which is a nice change-up to typical nachos. Their go-to item is the Green Chile Burrito which is delicious. The combination of red and green sauce adds a kick and adds the perfect amount of "mess" to the meal. Anything here is good and the prices are reasonable so you can enjoy your meal without breaking the bank.Picture this... it's the evening after a long day in the sun, lots of walking, lots of sight-seeing, lots of day-drinking and oh so many Scottsdale sun dresses.  Now it's almost midnight.  You're hungry, but you're also not in any shape to drive.  Well, if you're fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this joint, you're in for a treat.Right when you get past the parking lot, you feel like you're in line at Disneyland or Universal Studios.  There is running water, fake caverns and bridges taking you everywhere.  Plenty of tvs too but I was focused on one thing, lots of icewater and now it's time to talk about their green salsa (that happens to come for free along with chips and a yelp check in - BOOM).In my 36 years, I have been partial to red salsa ever since I can remember.  That's only because I hadn't yet tried this one.  It's like the perfect blend of tomatillo, jalapeno and green chiles... best I've ever had.  The waiter even brought out a 2nd tub due to our inhaling it in mere moments.  So good - I can't even explain.  If you ONLY come here for the green salsa and the New Mexican potstickers you are winning at life.I realize that maybe some of my taste buds were off due to that much day drinking, but I am convinced that whenever anything is the "best I've ever had" it's my duty to shout from a rooftop so my fellow friends and yelpers alike can also enjoy.  I don't remember which entree I ordered, and it was too difficult to determine what it was when I finished it off yesterday - but it was also tasty.  I will be back, and will be dreaming of that green salsa until that happens.Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking. My friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it. Guac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though. For lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it. Throughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were "free" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.  So buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx.

Review Text :
This is my first review and I had to write it about what is probably my favorite place EVER. I had my freaking graduation party here. With my family, 80 year old Grandma included. And she even liked it. The beer is just awesome. If me and my boyfriend can agree, it's great to split a $11 pitcher during happy hour (I know..the prices just went up but still not bad).  I love all the appetizers with the exception of the beer bread things.  They're just weird and too hard to eat. The jalepeno popper burger is so yummy. Cream cheese on a burger is such a good idea and the crispy onion strings add nice texture. Another plus is that it's not wimpy like most "Spicy" items. It's actually pretty spicy. I also LOVE their nightly specials. I've seen Filet Mignon, Buffalo, and Osso Bucco on those things! It's always a great surprise, and always delicious. The service is great, everyone is very friendly and the atmosphere is awesome. Sometimes the music is too loud to have a conversation inside so I'm a consistent patio diner. It's right by my house and I really like trying new places and cuisine so I'm always thinking of somewhere new to go, but it's great just to have an old standby that's consistently a good time.After reading all of the awesome reviews that came before mine (ok - maybe not all of them considering there are 54 to date), I knew I had to check this place out...I was there for lunch today and although I didn't even have their beer, I loved it!  Service was kind of slow but it was a beautiful day and we sat outside so it didn't matter that much.  The atmosphere and food made up for it... I had a delicious chef salad and a side of their beer bread.  I'm not kidding - it was one of my favorite lunches I've had EVER!  The salad was fresh and the sweet jalapeno dressing combined with the turkey, hard boiled egg, tomato, cucumber, greens, bleu cheese, and candied walnuts made every bite delicious!  I made my own little wrap with the side of bread.I cannot wait to go back to experience the hand crafted ales one evening soon, as well as some of the other menu items!If I liked beer, Four Peaks would be getting five stars. (I will say they have a peach ale that is realllly tasty!!) I wish I were my dad right now (that's creepy, I know) because his cabinet shop is literally right next door and he frequents this joint at least once a week. He has probably tried every beer and item on the menu over the past few years. I have been to this Four Peaks probably four times now, and I have been really happy with everything I have eaten. The 5-Layer Nachos (sofaking gooooodddd!!), Spinach Dip, Pizza, Hummus and even the Veggie Burger. They pour a healthy vodka soda and the prices are reasonable. Service is a tiny bit slow, but it is Tempe.One of my favorite things about this location is that it is hidden from the world. If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't know it was there (I swear that makes sense in MY head). I just wish they would allow you to bring dogs on the patio!If you ever get a spare moment, find Dallas G and ask him to tell you his story about Nachos. It's quite a tale told with so much fervor that you yourself might start believing in their power... And if all of this wasn't enough, it's right next door to Uranus Studios (owned and operated by Robin Wilson of the Goo Goo Dolls) so you may get to split bread with someone relatively famous in the 90's!Got invited here for HH and dinner.When the fish n chips special is walleye...well, you just can't say no!  The fish fry was awesome!  I haven't had walleye since my father died, and his birthday is coming up, so it was a great tribute.5 generous pieces of fish came with super-crispy fries, tartar sauce as well as cocktail sauce, a side of coleslaw and...malt vinegar with the condiments!  Four Peaks got it right.  Though the fish was a bit greasy on the outside, it was really tasty and fried perfectly.  There was not too much batter, so I could actually taste the fish.  Having the malt vinegar to douse the fries with gets major cool points.  Add a few dashes of salt and...mmmmyummy!The coleslaw was, eh, nothing major.  Really random crowd with many different types of people made me not cringe so much that I had been invited there.  I avoid the ASU crowd like the plague.  It was a bit loud to have a decent conversation, but it *was* Friday.Oh, and I got a parking spot right out front.  How can you beat THAT???????????Bah!  It was wicked hot in here mid afternoon!  If there was AC I couldn't find it.I do like the place - kind of cool that it is right in the brewery.Parking is an issue.  Street only so you may end up walking a bit.I was glad to try Four Peaks as I have been enjoying the Kiltlifter Scottish Ale since I arrived in the valley.  One of my favorite microbrews these days.I read in another review that they have good food and generous portions so I will be back to try the food...when the weather cools off!There are a few bar/restaurants in Tempe that are busy for a good reason.  This place is one of them.  Neighborhoody in its way, Four Peaks sits as the best place to take a visiting friend of any stature and taste.Now, this place is pretty much always busy, so if you're not looking for a crowd, go elsewhere.  The crowd at Four Peaks is generally nice and attractive, everyone drinking good beer and eating good food.  The restaurant/pub is located in a beautiful brick building, hidden among the half residential, half industrial 8th street drag.  Very well designed place with giant brass kettles and wood adornments and tables abounding around the large, open seating areas.The food is a notch above bar food.  Everything I've had I've enjoyed pretty much.  I recommend chicken strips (handmade!), italian beef beer bread, pizza and burgers all from personal experience.  The stout tiramisu dessert is great for beer lovers, though a little bitter for a dessert for some.The beers are great.  Hands down the best micro-brewery in Tempe (I think there are only two though ;)  The stouts are rich and delicious, I'm a big fan.  I'm also a fan of the HopKnot, which is peachy and hoppy (as the name states).  For kicks, take the risk and try their seasonal beer, whatever it is, guaranteed a good experience.Good place to go with a large group, a place to show a date you're in the know and also probably the tastiest place to rub elbows with the smarter side of ASU.By far one of my fave brewery's/bars in the valley. I look forward to the fall season bc that's when I know they will have their seasonal beer, Pumpkin Porter on tap soon. Absolutely amazing and one beer I actually  grew a craving for. My typical beer other wise is their house Hefeweizen with their order of salted pretzels with spicy mustard, which is FANTASTIC..If you're looking for a sweet but dry dark beer try the Oatmeal Stout, it's amazing as well. Alright I'm drooling thinking about this place, and no I'm no alcoholic just a beer connoisseur.On the first day of sunshine after days of rain, it was time to go out and play!  Blue skies, puffy clouds and an entire day to do nothing but have fun. What more can you ask for? My inaugural visit to Four Peaks was part of a multi-destination afternoon in and around Tempe. My friend, who spent a lot of Quality Time at Four Peaks while attending graduate school, was understandably horrified at my cultural black hole regarding such a time-honored establishment.  Don't hate - I'm from California!  So, after a huge lunch and a stroll around the ASU campus (taking pity on the hard-working MBA students in Saturday group meetings - oh, I remember that pain...) it was time to see what I had been missing. I think I spend too much time in Scottsdale, because at first I was disoriented. The stand-alone building is nowhere near a strip mall. It isn't beige. The parking lot is filled with rocks and doesn't have clearly-defined parking spaces (I can never park between the lines anyway, so I was more than OK with this). Also, I didn't see a single Affliction t-shirt. Yay. Both the front patio and interior were packed - I think this place has a license to print money.  Even with a full bar, I didn't see anyone without a pint glass - I am guessing not many mixed drinks are served here - lucky bartenders!  In addition to the printed menus, a large chalk board lists the beers on tap and the alcohol content of each - a range from 4% to an impressive 6.9% for the Raj IPA. We didn't eat anything (no stomach real-estate left) but did enjoy a pitcher of Hefeweizen (hey, there is always room for that, right?). Sitting at the bar, I could see that this place appeals to a wide variety of people. To our left, a group of older guys watching basketball and eating burgers. To our right, a couple of recent ASU grads we chatted with who were contemplating life plans, law school, an upcoming trip to Southeast Asia and eating Thai hummus - lucky girls!  Maybe I need a new life plan...  :)Good times - I really want to go back and try the spinach/artichoke dip. It looked SO good!Four Peaks Brewing Co = Arizona's sweetheart brewery and every ASU Sun Devils' dream come true.I came here for my buddy's farewell party.  I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of beer but when in Rome...   I had order myself a Four Peaks Peach Ale and shared a five-layer nacho dip with my buddies.  It was a busy Saturday night so service was actually pretty decent for it being packed.  Others had order more appetizers for everyone to share but I mainly sat around nursing my light and surprisingly delicious ale while munching on nachos.  Four Peaks is a super popular brewery considering ASU is close by.  Kudos on the owners picking such a prime location.  They really know their targeted audience well.  Parking is a nightmare so try to carpool.  The bathrooms are clean and the food portions and quality are decent.  I wouldn't mind stopping by again!I can't believe it's been years since I have updated my review! Four Peaks is one of those places that I like bringing out of town guest to, and also great place to just hang out with friends too!I still think the Popper Burger is outstanding, just so fresh and good! And if you haven't tried the Nachos, man you should, delsih!  I have tried a few fights within the last couple of years, but have to say my favorite is the Peach Ale, sometimes I just cave a Peach Ale in a frosty cold glass! So good!I have even tried some of the dessert a time or too, if you go and have a sweet tooth bugging ya, try the Stoutamisu, you won't be disappointed. Four Peaks still a favorite place for me, I'm sure I'll be back soon!

Restaurant name  Tottie's Asian Fusion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
May 19, 2008THIS IS NOW CALLED TOTTIE'S ASIAN FUSION. SAME FABULOUS OWNERS. EXPANDED DIGS. MORE SUSHI. Can't wait to check it out!Bland strip mall location does not equal bland experience. Do not be leary of an Asian restaurant that covers Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Normally that would scare me off. The room is full of well kept plants and the obligatory bamboo plants. The staff is uber friendly. This is probably due to the owners who go out of their way to know regulars names. I hadn't been there in months and Tottie remembered both me and my partners names. You MUST have the Tottie Spring Rolls....perfectly fried thin skinned yet plumply filled rolls served with large leaves of lettuce, fresh mint and cilantro along with fish sauce. The cool of the produce with the hot of the roll is so yummy I eat four and my partner eats four. I love the Thai section so far. I don't remember the name of what I've ordered recently but it had the best "fun" noodles with veggies and chicken....dee lish!The owner/chef checks on tables, is a dee lite and extremely personable lady. The menu is large and deserves exploring. Also a must order is an appetizer of chicken served over a fire with sugar sticks. Unreal. This is truly a warm and loving place.Tottie the Hottie. She is such a delight. I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce. But, meanwhile, I'll use her thin, crisp, hot and fresh spring rolls. Much of the staff appears to have been hired from Puberty Weekly. Seriously. Though very friendly, not very efficient. Great dinner with amazing friends before my stand up show this past Sunday.Ignore the fact that this restaurant is in a crappy little strip mall.  Once you step inside, you are instantly transported to a beautiful, upscale Asian fusion restaurant.  My eyes were mesmerized by the hanging crystal dragon sculpture.Our waitress was top notch.  We were all kind of iffy about what we would order, but when she described the green curry to one of my co-diners, who was about to order the red curry, we all changed our order.  And she was right on.  The green curry was delicious, probably one of the best I have ever personally consumed.  Full of vegetables, more so than the red according to our waitress, and a delicious creamy and spicy sauce.  I chose the shrimp to accompany my meal, which was perfect: large enough to not feel hosed, yet small enough to be bite-size.I even enjoyed the to-go container, which was a reusable plastic quart.  I'm not a fan of plastic, unless it is the reusable kind, and I definitely prefer this to the horrific styrofoam containers that some places use.  The waitress was also nice enough to send us home with some extra rice (something that a lot of restaurants don't think of doing).Only 4 weeks left at the clinic, so I'm not sure I'll have time to go back, but I'm definitely glad I went at least once.The second time I went back to this restaurant was peculiar.  The waitress started out clingy and constantly complimenting my friend, then she became very pushy about wanting us to leave.  She brought our check with 2 fortune cookies on top, came back 2 minutes later, then tossed the cookies onto the table and wiggled the check at us.  I was willing to write off this occasion since my first was so good.I went back for a 3rd try and actually had to walk out because the service was so bad.  Our group of 4 came in and said that we needed a table for 4.  The hostess showed us to a table with only 3 seats at it, then looked confused when we pointed out that we needed another chair.  She then showed us to another table with 3 seats, then started to walk away.  When we got her attention to point out that 3 seats are never adequate for 4 people regardless which side of the room it is on, she told us to go "wait in line" again.  Technically there was no line, but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either table.  While we were waiting for them to get their sh!t together, I noticed that the hostess was grabbing chairs from all over the restaurant and putting it at a table that did not have all of their dining partners.  I'm no restaurant owner, but it seems to me that it would be more important to seat people WHO ARE ACTUALLY THERE!  My blood was starting to boil, but we were seated and I was willing to forgive.We had our menus and we were ready to order, but we waited and waited.  I think it was 15 minutes before the waitress (the weird clingy one from my second trip) came to our table, we had no drinks, no nothing.  We realized how much time we were wasting and discussed getting our food to go before the waitress finally appeared at our table.  When we mentioned getting our food to go, she gave us THE NASTIEST LOOK then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted.I lost it.  I told the waitress that everything that we had experienced thus far was completely unacceptable and I wouldn't tolerate it.  I stood up to leave and she stood where she was (in my way), ignored me, and tried to take my dining companion's orders.  She finally backed off without even a glimmer of apology after my companion's realized that I really was leaving. I will not go back here ever again, no food is worth this treatment.Totties...I've read the 24 reviews that came before mine over and over, and I have to say, it was even better than expected!Picture this:Sunday evening - dark and cold outside.  Hanging inside with fiance and future sister-in-law.  All of us feeling tired and hungry but too lazy to cook dinner.  Just watched Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice reruns and worked up appetite...Thai food?  I suggested to them - oh yeah, we can't do that... none of the thai restaurants are open on Sundays.  Damn.Vietnamese maybe?  Nope - the closest one I could think of was closed on Sundays also.Chinese?  Too bad we don't have a great Chinese restaurant close by in the new 'hood anymore.I know, let's try somewhere new... Totties!  I called to make sure they were open, and sure enough - not only were they open, but they are not even a mile away!  Perfect...Tottie's was awesome - it was nicer inside than I imagined - for some reason I had in my head that it was going to be like Pei Wei - but it wasn't at all.  We were seated immediately and Kethy was our server (yes, Kethy - not Kathy).  She was cute and had personality - something you don't always find in restaurants now-a-day.  She honored our request to start with a big bowl of egg drop soup and add wontons to it!With the soup on the way, we perused the menu... I love that Tottie's offers Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and sushi too!  We mixed it up a bit and ordered Pad Se Ew with Beef, Moo Shu Chicken, Thai Basil Stir Fry veggies, and steamed vegetable dumplings.  Medium spice and light on the oil.  It was way too much food, but it was fun to share a bunch of dishes, and now we have leftovers for dinner tonight!**Pad Se Ew was the favorite dish of all but nothing we ordered was disappointing.Total bill for all of the above was $43 before tip... not bad considering the amount of food we had!  Service was attentive - not only from Kethy, but Tottie (I think) came by, and our waters were fill constantly too.I will totally return to Tottie's in the near future whether it be for Chinese, Thai, Sushi, or Vietnamese - or a combo... oh, and I'll have to remember to save room for the avocado ice cream next time!Imagine my horror when I dined at Tottie's recently and she quoted from my last update..."I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce.Yep. That's what I said. It was preceded however by how delightful she is. And believe me, she is. Such a good sport. We had a good laugh.We ate here Sunday afternoon after attending the ridiculous Warehouse Sale at Mojave Middle School in Scottsdale (think Ed Hardy vomiting in a gymnasium). So we were hungry and ready for Tottie's Rolls. We consumed THREE orders! Fabulous as always. Potstickers were perfection as was the Hot n Sour soup. Serve was spot on, friendly and playful even!So Tottie. You rock my dim and my sum! Can't wait to go back!2/26/10Came during lunch hours to check out the Thai lunch menu only to find out that TAF's lunch menu only lists a few Chinese selections.  Thus, after skimming over the lunch menu, as well as the dinner menu for Thai selections, I chose to go with the Beef Lo Mein, which came w/ a bowl of soup and an eggroll, and the Tofu Green Curry.  The beef lo mein was delicious!  Loved the thin egg noodles combined w/ veggies and tender beef.  Correction- not all of the beef pieces were tender, but I didn't mind since I also had the tofu green curry to contend with.  Took leftovers home for Mom and I to enjoy later.  Tottie's green curry has made my Mom a fan of Thai food at last!  (I haven't been able to win her over with any other of the Thai restaurants I frequent.)  She didn't like the lo mein, though.  Said that the leftover noodles were hard.  The noodles must've dried out in the fridge, for they weren't dry when I had them for lunch.  As for the soup, I selected hot and sour, but when it arrived, I could see that a thickener was used, so I inquired as to what was the thickening agent.  The answer?  Cornstarch.  And so, I had it whisked away.I am a fan of homemade coconut ice cream and fried plantains.  It is one of my favorite food combinations, and wouldn't you know it, TAF's Honey Fried Bananas proved to be a great contender among some of the best I've had in the valley (Siam Thai and Wild Thaiger also offer great versions)!  The banana slices were encased in a light batter, fried, and then drizzled with honey, and then topped with a scoop of exquisite coconut ice cream.  Don't forget the peanuts on top!  What makes the ice cream exquisite?  Why, this scoop was chockful of real coconut ribbons!  The light crunch of the battered bananas, still warm from the pan, paired well w/ the cool, creamy, coconutty delight.  Mmm... you must try this sweet dish! ---4/16/10I've been back with Mom at least three times since, as I've hooked her onto Tottie's Soft-shelled Crab Curry.  (My mother is so hard to draw out of the house, but now, if I want to be graced with her company, all I have to do is utter the words "soft-shelled crab," and voila!)  Do try any of the curries offered here with a side of egg noodles.  As far as I could tell, these were seasoned only with soy sauce, but they proved to be an excellent bed for the divine crab curry!  We may just have to pay Tottie's a visit tonight!Okay, I could probably live without Asian food.  I like Chinese and Thai on occasion, especially if it's cold out.  The rest of it I wouldn't miss.  Sorry, Mexico is my true love.  But I have to say, I love Tottie's, if for no other reason than the Green Curry.  It is easily one of my favorite dishes right now.I've tried both the lemon and tangerine chicken (apparently I could not live without citrus), and while good, they cannot compete with the green curry.  Generally I would prefer Chinese to Thai, or so I thought.  I know, it's like comparing apples to oranges.  I also really like the Tottie rolls.  The spring rolls taught me I'm not a fan of rice paper, but I loved the peanut sauce.  Anything dipped in that peanut sauce would be good!Given its location,  I was pleasantly surprised that Tottie's is actually quite nice inside, although we usually get take-out.  In fact, today is quite chilly.  I think that curry is calling me."I can't believe I drove so far for this place" comes to mind when I recall my experience here. Excuse me to my pals who think this place is all that. I guess we all can't have the same opinions; we'd just be robots. Maybe  they had a bad day, as in a really bad day - with the word really underlined, twice. Problems with the kitchen, problems with the service, problems with the fact they're even open. The high point of this experience was waiting for my friend to show up, I stopped at the second hand store next door and didn't buy anything.At this point, I don't care to remember what I ordered, I just remember trying to order it a 6 of 7 and the waitress scoffed at me and asked if I was sure I wanted it that spicy. "You can always make it hotter, but can't make it less spicy." I guess that was true because I gave in and ordered it a 5. What I didn't realize was that the waitress meant to say I ordered a 5 on a scale of 1-100, cause this didn't have any spice at all. bleh...After a few bites I calmly explained that on a scale of 1 to 7 that my dish was more like a 0, no spice at all. Her response, if you really must know, she said, sorry, we just had a "big order from a table of 6 people" if you want the kitchen to re-make your order, it will be about 30 minutes. Instead of waiting for 30 minutes, I asked if she could bring me some thai chili peppers and some chili paste to add to my dish, I'd just take care of it myself instead; she showed up with chili oil and soy sauce. :-/ Thanks, I guess. I pushed through, spiced up my dish to satisfaction and 'enjoyed' the rest of my meal, but mostly the conversation with my friend and not really the meal or the dining experience. My friends dish was pretty sub satisfactory to her, and she asked the waitress to just take it back. The waitress didn't seem to want to just take the dish from the table and leave it at that, after insisting on making a new dish to replace the unsatisfactory dish about five times. Instead of just returning the dish, she gave in to the waitress and selected something different. While her replacement dish was better, but not awesome, she ended up getting charged for the replacement dish she didn't really want to begin with.Given the choice, next time I'll aim for taco bell. Not exactly apples to apples in comparison, but at least I wont have to spend a lot for crummy service and mediocre food.Happy Yelping Phoenix.Tottie's is a family owned restaurant where customer service prevails. The food is mouth watering to look at and painfully delicious to eat. Painful? WHA- The problem is how much you'll want to eat.My friend and I stopped in for a late afternoon bite. We had just missed the lunch specials (but that's ok! more to take home) and settled into our luxurious booth. The restaurant offers a variety of seating, ranging from tables to booths to the bar. All look equally appealing. (And can readily accommodate groups.)Michael charmed us with the joy and eagerness he exuded. After ordering Pad Thai and Panang Curry he generously offered us soup leftover from lunch. (And our rubber arms quickly said yes!) SOUPWhy does this have it's own category? The egg drop soup and sweet and sour are *only* served during lunch hours. (11am - 2pm). If you're lucky some might be leftover and Michael might be around to share. You should try those two soups. And here's a trick. Try those two soups mixed together.Hoy My Goodness.The sweet and sour is a powerfully strong soup offering a kick of spice. The egg drop soup is rich (and has mushrooms, which work quite well) and creamy in a different way. Together? You've got to try it. I highly recommend it. HAPPY HOURRuns Tuesday thru Friday, 5pm - 7pm. Food and drink specials abound. Sushi rolls are discounted and they offer things like Sake Bombers, Mimosas, a Riesling and a red blend for $5. (Some other wines for $4. Budlight for $2.50.) FOODThe Pad Thai delivers on all levels. If you really want it fire engine hot they will provide additional spices. The Panang Curry kicks butt. Spicy means enough to clear your sinuses but not make you cry. The dinner portions are ginormous. You could readily share a meal...but then there'd be no leftovers!I'd definitely throw in a Thai Tea if you've never had one. It's almost smoky in taste (yet sweet) and goes down too quickly.SERVICEI don't know how he did it, Michael must have eyes in the back of his head or something, but my Diet Pepsi was never empty. I slurped down three that I can remember. And he even offered to provide one to go!This place rocks!p.s. there's another location in northern scottsdale.

Review Text :
Okay before I start talking about food let me tell you that being an Indian student I have had the best and worst of Indian food and I was prepared for anything when I entered the restaurant.I was also a bit cautious regarding the service since my friends had a harrowing time with the management (A tale for another day). Once seated, the waiter-cum-floor manager impatiently prodded us for the order (5 times in a gap of 5 minutes). Irritated already, we hurried and went for Onion Pakoras for starters, few Rotis, Paneer Masala and Aloo Gobi for the main course. The Decor was boring and dull with rolls of curtain carelessly hanging from the walls. Since Aesthetics hardly matter to me, I ignored it. The food did not arrive for 25 minutes and neither did the pesky waiter. Looking around, we found all the waiters having a great time sharing anecdotes and sipping on a drink. Finally after 30 minutes, the main course arrives without the starters being served. I could not imagine what excuse the management could give when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant! The food was good, curry was done with medium spice just like we ordered. The naans were just about right although the mango lassi wasn't the best. Overall we were pleased with the food. Just when I was thinking that the place wasn't too bad, the waiter interrupts us, hands over the cheque and asks us to pay immediately since the cash register was "closing". I was *stunned* ! We had just started with our meal !!! Although I was furious, I politely replied that the payment will be done soon after we are done. 10 minutes after, the floor-manager takes time off from chatting with the staff and with all the "courtesy" asks us to pay up soon. That was it! We quickly gobbled the food, paid and left the place in disgust! The food was worth 3 stars but I will never ever visit Delhi Palace again, not now, not ever! For a good Indian meal I would suggest visiting 'Chutneys' , 'Kabab Palace', or even drop by my house, you will not be disappointed!

this is the best thai food place in the valley.  period.  other kitchens come here to learn and guess their food contents and how to cook it.trust me, i been to sawadee, thai rama, the old char thai, malee, yuphas, thai paradise.  if u talk to the owner, he can tell u that sawadee's owner and chef started coming the longest, thus their food come in as number 2 behind this place.  the rest are still trying.if u want noodles, order this "kim-mao" or tell the owner, drunken noodles.  its not on the menu but its very good.  oh, it can be quite spicy, so if u dun like it too hot, let them know.   An alternative for the noodles will be pad see yew, which is also rice noodles, but this one with dark sweet soy sauce.i dun need to tell u abt their good curries, just order them and try them.  do order their pork with mint leaves.  its got an interesting flavor and very tasty :)* This place serves amazing NORTH EASTERN THAI food from Essan region. This is an important fact to take note of.After reading the poor reviews for this place it's easy to see that the poor reviewers have never been to Thailand and had REAL Thai food. This is real Thai food.The service is always super friendly. The old man is very sweet and very chatty. It's just him and his wife so sometimes he's busy. They ABSOLUTELY adjust the spice levels, so whoever said they don't is misinformed.Why do they have Chinese food on the menu? Well, look at the poor reviewers here and that's exactly why. They're serving authentic NE Thai food here. Most people in AZ can't tell you where the USA is on a map let alone Thailand. They have to offer mainstream Chinese foods because that's what their clientele expects. Same reason the Burmese spot on Southern and McClintock does as well. Unfortunately, if they sold only their core product, they probably couldn't stay alive. This is Country Club and McKellips in Mesa, AZ, not the San Gabriel Valley in SoCal.EVERYTHING from their Authentic Thai portion of the menu is amazing and will fill your taste buds with a real treat.

This crazy chicken location can choke on my fresh batch of cream!I don't even think a complete review is necessary! I will just detail the conversation I had during my last crappy sit down visit.ME: I would like a breast and a wing.Employee: We don't have that ready right now.ME: OK, how long?Employee: Well we no have any made right now.ME: Ok well that is what I am wanting so will they be making any? I see an entire char broiler full of chicken, you don't have any breast or wings cooked?Employee: Yeah none is ready.ME: I am willing to wait.Employee: Ok but will be 15 minutes.ME: Ok, well that is what I came here for so I will wait.Employee: Yeah but is 15 minutes you wait.ME: I said that is fine, are you trying to talk me out of a breast and wing????Employee: No but will be 15 minutes to cookENOUGH SAID!It is like going to the sex store and them being out of dildos, I mean come on!How are you a place that is known for chicken and not have all parts readily available?You mean I am the only person on the planet that wants white meat consisting of a breast?I should have ordered the chicken tostada bowl that I ordered in my previous visit which was pretty good.

Damn Damn this place was goodDamn I went here honestly thinking it would suck and I would be writing a bad reviewDamn I was wrongThe hubby and I cruised on in Sunday night and were seated right away by a very friendly hostess. I like the decor and layout - very cool. I think red is just damn sexy period!Our server was very nice and friendly  - between the busboy and her, we were well taken care of. Sushi was killer - it ranks with the best places I have ever enjoyed the take of the sea. I suggest the Palm Roll and the spicy scallop and shrimp....okay everything we ended up ordering was perfection. And damn, the manager even came over to check on us and we had a very nice chat with him. Damn I was wrongDamn I can't wait to go back!My rating system (5 is the best)    Food=0  //  Service=0  //  Attitude=-10 //  Crowd=Normal  //  Consistency=No  //  Bathrooms=The best part of the experience //  Overrated=YESTOP 5 WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCES... For a little Buddha the manager had a big napoleon complex. I was a victim of that Waterdog large party massacre. 18 people took taxis from the Wynn... When we arrived the restaurant was 1/2 empty and the manager decided to split up the group. He was a triple threat - a total liar, bad attitude and worse breath. When I told him I would Yelp about our experience - he said don't threaten me.No threats here - there are too many good restaurants in Vegas, save your money and your taxi fare...

Review Text :
You are not going to get a traditional Irish pub in Vegas, it's just not going to happen. That would be like saying that the Venetian makes you feel just like you are floating down a canal in Italy or that the New York New York is The Big Apple of your eye. Hell, if this were true we could all just flock to Vegas and come home saying we traveled the world...and save a lot on airfare in the process. No, this is not a possibility. What you get in Vegas are suggestions and small glimpses of places that actually exist, done up in bright lights with a dash of tacky and a facade of what the real thing might slightly resemble. The farther away from the strip that you get, the less inherent these qualities are, so, since it is a bit out of the way, McMullan's is not a bad rendition of an Irish Pub. They pour a good Guinness, are one of the few places that carries Magners in Vegas, and many of their menu items are traditional pub fare. They, however, seem to be, like many establishments in Vegas, trying too hard and overdoing it a bit. Nice switch from the glitter and glam of the strip, priced more local friendly, and a variety of bands most every night of the week. Not a bad place, but if you want a true Irish pub Ireland would be a good place to look.I can now update my review for McMullan's because we came here for dinner last night before going to a show at the Las Vegas Little Theatre.  While I am not knowledgeable about Irish pubs, McMullan's earns all 5 stars--it was as good as it gets!I asked our server, Jessica, if we could sit out of the bar area in the small room that is to the right after you enter.  Once our eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, it turned out to be the right choice.  It's a delightful room and just a bit away from the music and the talking in the bar area.I had studied the menu online before we went, and I knew what I was getting, the Irish chicken curry pie.  Andrea surprised me by wanting the steak and mushroom pie so it was Irish pies for both of us.  We knew in advance that it would be at least a 25 minute wait and we just chatted and I took some photos and explained what was behind the door to the Shenanigans room.Our pies were brought to us and they were delicious.  I loved the curry taste of my chicken and there was some zing to the curry.  It was much different than the flavors of Indian or Thai curry.  The pastry was very flaky and stayed that way all the time I was eating.  Andrea enjoyed her pie, too.  With both dinners came a large amount of mashed potatoes and a good serving of peas.  All the time, our iced teas were refilled and Jessica checked back often to see how we were doing. Of course, a dinner out is not complete without the sweet so we ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and shared it.  We got it with vanilla ice cream which was put in a separate glass goblet so the heated pudding didn't melt the ice cream.  A winning dish!During our time here, Mr. McMullan came to the table twice.  He remembered me from the shows I was there to see and he wanted to say hello.  Later he checked to make sure everything was OK with our dinner.The personal touch of Mr. McMullan, the delightfully friendly server Jessica, and the outstanding food all made the evening a 5 star experience.  And what could be better than this--seeing two Yelp friends and somewhat neighbors, who were there having dinner too!  Hey Candace. and August.  Good to see you again!We will be coming back to try more of the things on their extensive menu!My husband and I agreed we needed something new, it had been a while for Irish. First thing I wanted to try the beer, so I got 'bits of beer' #3, Guinness, Kikenny cream ale, Murphy's Irish Stout, Boddingtons cream ale, and Smithwicks Irish ale. They were all good, some strong and some very light, loved them all!We got two apps to go with the bits of beer, the Irish sausage rolls and McMullan's Irish nachos. The sausage rolls had sausage stuffed in puff pastry and came with a mustard dipping sauce, they were crispy like a egg roll. The nachoes were not expected, a tower of potato chips smothered in cheese, bacon, onions, tomatoes, chives and sour cream! Like a baked potato but made with chips, very good and very big order, both apps could have been shared by four or more!For entree's, he got the Irish pie and I got Nanny Mac's Shepherds pie! Both were rich and delicious, filling and warmed my heart! Carrots, sweet peas and ground beef in a savory broth covered with mashed! Served with brown bread! Yummy.We still had room for dessert and had to try the sticky toffee pudding with scoop of ice cream! Very good food, exceptional  service and great beer!Met some clients here for dinner during the week. It wasn't crazy busy as my previous visit which was kinda nice.We started off  with the Do Dheag Wings - 12 wings, 3 different ways - bbq, hot sauce & lemon pepper seasoning along with crab cakes which were solid starters. We also ordered dinner ala carte. I was in the mood for something different and went for the Irish stew - braised lamb, potatoes & other vegetables and came with homemade brown bread. The stew was hearty tasting and  was really satisfying. I also tried the bangers and gravy which was yummy & could be also a nice appetizer. Another tasty entree is the fish and chips. Service from our waiter was spot on and friendly. Mcmullan's Irish Pub has a locals atmosphere but I felt comfy and welcome!GOOD GOD don't die before you get the Irish Nachos here. In fact just stop reading this and get your ass out here and try them. It's a pound of home made potato chips, covered in Irish cheddar with Bacon, tomato, chives and sour cream. Need I say more besides during happy hour (4-7pm every day) they like 1/2 off! All the food here is amazing and we'll be the first to admit that most pub food isn't great. The chicken curry pie, the fish and chips and the reuben stand out. Good Lord they have Murphys on tap! The entertainment is great most of the time although we've see some hippie non-Irish band there a few times that kind of stink, but still. The decor is awesome, it's like being in the Shire. The mood is fun, rowdy and loud, you'll feel like you are in the lower decks of the Titanic.. uh, before the whole iceberg thing of course and the staff if about as good as it gets. We're not just saying that cause Benji works there, all the staff are good, there are even cute girls with Irish brogues... rawr!Oh My Dear God...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with one word: horrendous. My boyfriend and I needed a place to eat and stay for a bit since we were just leaving the Mr. Olympia competition held that the New Orleans Hotel and Casino. Since the taxi and shuttle bus service was unbearably long we decided to be a little dangerous and cross the street in the pouring rain to this bar. After looking up the yelp reviews and seeing that people liked this place, we went in. I was immediately punched in the face by the awful smell of smoke and my ears bled immediately due to the bartender's foul mouths. There were three bartenders: Jason, Chris (who was female) and some other man who looked super stressed out and had a cold. I counted 31 times they said the F word. I'm not saying I'm prude or offended, I just think it is super unprofessional. When we walked in we sat down at the bar where there were about five others sitting. It took a bartender 13 minutes to even notice us and another 15 minutes to actually get us our drinks (which I refused to drink from the straw since the female bartender "Chris" was using her hand to wipe away her runny nose continuously). My boyfriend was hungry; however, we were so hesitant to order food from this place! We waited forever for someone to come by again after our drinks were given--the standard is to give drinks and provide a menu, hello?! We had to ask the bartender Jason if their kitchen was open and he pretended not to hear us until my boyfriend stood up and called out to him, then replied with a short rude "ya." Due to the cab wait being over an hour he went ahead and ordered a chicken sandwich. This took about 25 minutes to come out. As we were sitting at the bar I realized that the food was being placed right next to the registers when it was coming straight out of the kitchen. This is NOT good. The chef or runner was placing the food plates next to the dirtiest place in the bar--restaurant rule NEVER place food near money. GROSS. Also, I believe the manager was there as well. I wanted to so badly confront him. However, he may have had a heart attack since he could barely breathe and move about the bar. I figured I'd save my own breath and just get the hell out of there.*Note: There were a lot of regulars. If you are not a regular you will be ignored. Not matter what.This really hurts my heart, because I was a huge McMullan's fan.  Tuesday, St. Patrick's day, is also my fiancee's birthday.  Every year we pick a spot, and spend all day, and hundreds of dollars drinking and eating.  This year we picked McMullan's. We arrived, and they were packed, of course.We let them know that we planned to have at least 5-10 more people arriving throughout the day, and we got nothing but attitude.  We were seated in a back room, at a 2 person table. Ok fine, no worries...we'll start here and then ask to move to a larger table when more people show up.  No biggie.  Then, we had menus dropped off, and we asked how much their pints were. "Oh...I don't know."*blink*You don't know how much your beer is?  So she went off to find out, and another server came over, and asked if we'd decided.  My fella said "I'd like a Murphy's Irish Stout.""Oh, we don't serve that in this room."*blink*"its on your menu.""well, THIS room is set up for Guinness.  The other room has Murphy's."By this time, I was pretty angry, so I said:"Well, do you THINK that someone could...I don't know, WALK to the other room and BRING us one?  Its the only available table in the place, AND its his birthday, I kind of want him to have the beer he wants."With a huge fake smile, and a "Kiss my @$$" attitude she says "I'd be happy to"Before we did though, we asked her how much a pint was. "I don't know."Seriously?So she came back from asking, and it was $8 a pint. I'm angry now.  They are normally $4-$6 a pint. So then she busts out this attitude of "Well its St. Patrick's Day" Yeah.. Most bars have lowered their prices for the holiday.  Instead, you have doubled yours?  No thank you.As much as I love the food here, I will not be back.For a bar/restaurant to DOUBLE their prices to higher than most places on the Strip, AND to have rude service...I will NEVER go back to McMullan's as long as I can help it.  I'd rather go to the Strip to Ri Ra, where I can get good service.  Greedy, greedy, greedy. You guys were packed.  There was absolutely NO need to double your prices. You've just lost a ton of business, because everyone I have told about this has said they won't be back either.

Two words...Sea Dog!! Oh my goodness, they are so yummy. Take a hot dog bun (genius!), add a nice piece of fried Cod, coleslaw on top, and their very own red sauce and BAM! you got yourself a great Sea Dog!! The owners are super friendly as well as the staff. Try also the fried clams and oysters-super good!

"Well, my wife's from Iowa so that pretty much makes me from Iowa too."This place is a diamond in the rough.  A needle in a haystack. A king among men.  Well, you get the idea.  It's located between 'Bum F*** Egypt', and 'Where the hell am I', but it is worth the drive!We usually run down there for breakfast because they have the BEST whole wheat pancakes this side of Iowa city! The rest of the food there is pretty much what you would expect from a midwestern greasy spoon, but the pies... oh the pies...The only downside to writing a review about their pies, is that the english language doesn't have words to describe how utterly amazing they are. Exquisite? Nay.  Delectable? Closer, but not close enough.  I will simply say that if you venture to the realm of this genius facility, pie it up.This is the 2nd time I've been to this place. The first time was in their old location and we had a pretty bad experience and then we went again since they've moved and not much else has changed.Welcome to death's waiting room ladies and gentleman! (hold for trumpets)First of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit.  Once seated expect to continue to wait forever for your food. We decided to sit at the breakfast bar where you have full access to the kitchen window, this was probably the best part of our experience - talk about entertainment. The waitresses are constantly stressed and do they bitch and moan- totally unprofessional.   After about 30 min. of watching "the kitchen window movie" we realized that we still hadn't gotten our food (we ordered simple dishes: 2 egg/hashbrowns  and I got a side of cinnamon bun french toast).  The person sitting next to us who came in long after was already eating.  When I asked what the deal was she said his meal was super simple that's why he got his before us. "You two ordered omeletes right?" Umm no we didn't...oh and  wait, stop, hold up...let me get this straight so people who order biscuits and gravy and french toast get to eat before people who order eggs and french toast? Well ok I'll make sure to get that next time then! Now that we know the secret our experience should be much better.We finally got our food after 40 min and it was wrong.  (boo! I'm starving!)   After going through all of that the food was just ok. The homefries are good but the rest was sub par.  The "homemade" cinnamon roll they used for the french toast was chewy and dry and the ham my husband ordered looked a lot like spam meat to me.  After all the waiting and drama this place just isn't worth it.  I should note that our waitress was very nice and did a pretty good job even though she was slammed but I bet it was b/c we were literally  sitting in her face at the breakfast bar and even in that location we never got a refill on our waters or coffee...ok so never mind she wasn't good either.  She did comp some of my meal which was a nice gesture though I would have demanded that if she didn't offer anyway.Additional Tip: For all you omelete eaters out there, they cook them then microwave them before they're served. I'm really not a fan of microwaved eggs so I thought I'd pass that nugget along.  Sitting in front of the Kitchen window can certainly be enlightening...and gross.

Review Text :
It was a Saturday. I think. I can't be so sure of it these days. I live my life with such reckless abandon that every day might as well be Saturday. But I'm pretty sure this was one of those "real Saturdays" where walking around in my jammies and showing up at people's houses at 10pm with the latest knock-off "mockbuster" on DVD is considered "normal behavior" and not chalked up to "harmless yet nonetheless annoying eccentricity".With the recent price hikes on campus (4.99 for a sandwich that thinks it's a burrito? Have your mental disorder on your own dime, punk!), I've taken to "brown bagging" (which is what I call it even though I carry my lunch in a metal Dr. Pepper lunchbox that also doubles as a purse. I'm eccentric. Didn't you get the memo?) my on-campus meals. Which means I spend my weekends at Fry's looking at the lunch meat aisle going "Hmmm...which of these could I eat every day for two weeks and not forcibly strangle myself with my own vomit?"On my way back to my car, laden with plastic bags full to bursting with failure and sad, I passed by the Dragon Garden Express, glancing at their menu. I initially decided against it, heading back to my car so I could feng shui my refrigerator to accommodate my ASU Meal Plan, when I heard the restaurant calling me.Which is a metaphor for "crazy manager screaming at me from the door"."YOU WANT MENU TO TAKE HOME!?"Nah, I thought. If I took home a menu I'd just sit there, thinking of how much happier I'd have been if I spent my grocery money on an afternoon's worth of sweet and sour pork."YOU COME IN THEN! GET SOMETHING TO GO!"Maybe the screaming Asian woman related to my lament. Perhaps she thought her cuisine would lift my spirits.Or maybe it was a really slow day.I decided to come inside before anyone got hurt.You know how in the early Mario Bros games, you always played as Mario, although the manuals clearly state that Luigi is faster and can jump higher than the crimson-hued Ron Jeremy?That's how it felt when I walked in.Even though it was the weekend, DGE still offered lunch specials. Most places, Wong's included, exclude weekends from any of their lunch of dinner specials. Which is convenient, of course, because that's when Wong's gets most of its customers. DGE, despite it clearly being Saturday, offered 5 and 6 dollar lunch combos. The atmosphere in DGE is just...happier. I'm not sure how to describe it. When I go to other local Chinese restaurants the mood is so dapper. Like everyone's just waiting for that screenplay to writing to get picked up. Like the whole "serve cuisine of our homeland" game got really old, really fast, but they put all their eggs in one basket and have to wait for them to hatch and become dragons and burn the village or something. But DGE just has this happy, quiet vibe to it. And clean to boot. The place is splotless, with a hint of chow mein goodness. If I ever own a house, that's what I'd want my kitchen looking/smelling like all the time.Initially I was hesitant to try the combos. Because I'm not big on fried rice. That's Panda Express' redeeming quality. It lets me have my lo mein noodles on the side, instead of demanding that I have it as an entree.I figure if you can get a Big Mac with chicken nuggets on the side, I should be able to get mu shu with lo mein on the side. Oh well.I took the plunge anyway. I got the kung pao. They boxed it up in one of those styrofoam take-home boxes with the smiling face. Which I always find a nice touch. All these other places like to decorate their packaging with proclamations of how awesome their product is. This was a thank you note and motivational propaganda all at once. I love the digital age.The kung pao was cruncy and soupy, like a chicken and peanut cereal. It was like eating a salad and occasionally drinking from a cup of hot sauce at the same time. The egg roll was chewy and savory, the rangoons were crispy and cheesy, and the small mound of fried rice was fine also.  I was too involved in plowing through my awesome with a side of FUCKYEAH! that I couldn't even be bothered to tell my housemates where I had discovered this little treasure trove of chicken, peanuts, and whatever the hell else they put in kung pao. I just kept showing them my receipt, which I kept just in case I had to add in the business info when I eventually yelped it. The moral of this mindless, meandering story? If you want good, cheap takeout on a weekend, do Dragon Garden Express.Or they will scream at you.

Review Text :
Y E L P !!! My first restaurant comment after lurking the reviews for nearly a  year.I was up for a late breakfast and really craved something along the lines of a family diner where I could sit at the counter, read my paper, sip my coffee, plan my day and feel comfortable in flip-flops, t-shirt and shorts. My  inbox showed that I had received the Weekly Yelp. A quick search found all of the usual haunts that I ride my bike to in my end of Scottsdale. I had some business in Tempe and narrowed my search to that area. Voila! Harlow's was the first listing. As a native, I have seen the various incarnations of this local establishment and heard all the raves, yet I never had the time or I wasn't in the area. Not today! I knew that it was almost always busy and figured since it was just me, a little wait wouldn't hurt.When I arrived, the parking lot was half full. I parked, grabbed my paper and entered into exactly what I expected. Nothing fancy but a very comfortable interior that is inviting. It's roomier than it looks from the outside. Air conditioning was set to cool off anyone coming in from the 105 that had already settled in and was rising. I went to the empty counter and was greeted immediately by one of the many waitresses. She served my coffee and I never opened the menu and asked if I could just tell her what I wanted and she said, "No problem." The reviews said that the waitresses were cute and young and hot (true), but that is a disservice to how efficient and productive they are. They were all busy, all moving, all social and most importantly made everyone feel welcome. Even first time, old timers like me.My food was fantastic, large portioned and prepared the way that I requested, but everybody has different likes and dislikes so I won't give any more review on food. Here's the kick-in-the-nuts part of my visit......after carefully planning where I was going, getting my paper and heading out to breakfast, I kept feeling that I had forgotten something. Hmmmmm, what could it be? Oh, well, off I go.Still bothering me in the back of my head as I go to pay at the front register. Money clip left at home! Red-faced and kicking rocks, I approach the hostess and explain my plight, feeling like a two-bit bum without two-bits. Got any dishes you need washed? There was a manager (and I'm assuming owner) at the front as well and without skipping a beat, she takes the ticket from my hand and says, "That's OK. We're open until 2pm. Just come on back when you get your money." She was smiling and pleasant and never asked my name or phone or any details. She never hesitated. It's not like I'm a regular and they know where to find me. I offered to leave my cell phone as collateral, but she would not accept. Embarrassed, I went to my truck, determined to return as quickly as possible with my cash. Then I remembered that I keep a twenty in the truck for emergencies (like this one). Woo Hoo! I went right back in and thanked her for faith in humanity and vowed to return and tell my friends. It's rare these days to find that comfortable, small-town trust. We are, after all, the biggest little metropolis in the southwest.Kudos to Harlow's for great food, quick and friendly service, personality  and a personal touch that went a long way with this customer.I was looking for a good diner, went to trusty Yelp, found Harlow's, sorted by Elite...Mark D's review had me at "bad girl." Looks like Harlow's could be a good impromptu UYE lunch spot or hangover recovery HQ. I had the basic eggs scrambled with cheese, home fries with onions, wheat toast. My diner standard fare. Good stuff, just what you're looking for when you need the diner grub. Harlow's is pricier than diners I'm accustomed to. $7 is a little steep for what I had. But it was perfectly diner-done and in front of me in under 5 minutes. When I lived in Cleveland's west side there was a large diner density so to stay competitive they always had specials for under $5 bucks.I found a new breakfast spot! This place is a dive; a dive you would most likely drive by on a daily basis and never think twice about. At least, that's what I did! But, I can now say that I will never let this happen again because they have one solid breakfast! This is an old school breakfast spot. It's a little shack off of University with booths and tables in every nook and cranny. People wait for this breakfast and that says a lot about this little spot. It reminds me of a breakfast diner I visited as a child or one I would have liked to find in college. The food is delicious. They have homemade everything including tasty homemade muffins (go for the blueberry) and homemade biscuits as well. Their portions are large and in charge. I had the egg white omelet and could only finish half. It also came with breakfast potatoes that hit the spot. The meal wasn't fancy but it was good. When I'm in the area, I will definitely choose Harlow's Cafe as my breakfast spot. I'm just sad it took me this long to find it!

Review Text :
What kind of backasswards place still clings to a "Cash Only" policy?A.) Dive bars that can't be trusted to give you a clean glass, but can be trusted to offer a complimentary sprinkle of crabs on the toilet seat.B.) Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner.C.) Cruddy breakfast diners trying to instill an aura of the "greatest generation." Why I remember a time back before that newfangled in-ter-net contraption when I had to walk uphill both ways in waist deep snow to... Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?!D.) All of the above.Ding! Time's up. Pencils down. Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.A strict "No Cellphones" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?It's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it.I'm with Michael on this place.  I don't get the adoration of this place.  It's always packed.  People fall all over themselves to praise these cash-only schmucks. So who the eff cares that this place is cash only?  I do. Restaurants like this stick out like a sore thumb in Phoenix. I hardly ever carry cash.  I know.  Bad habit.  But, please Original Pancake House, buy a flippin credit card merchant machine thing and raise your prices on everything by 75 cents.  It's really inconvenient. Luckily there are many other breakfast places who accept debit/credit cards in the immediate area (Over Easy, Orange Table, etc.).I don't care for pancakes (so I'm no expert on them) but I usually order the chorizo scramble here and give my pancakes to my dining partner. Good egg to chorizo ratio on the scramble.  Very quick service once you're seated, but the wait can be long on occasion.  It's all good though, because during your wait you can marvel and analyze the uber-60s architecture of the interior.I learned this morning that "Original Pancake House" and "IHOP" are two very different restaurants... and in my mind, "IHOP" is much better.We ended up at this OHOP for breakfast around 11am (on a Sunday).  We were lucky enough to get a parking spot and a table within just a few minutes.  Once seated, I noticed how tacky the interior is decorated, but that is no big deal.  The big deal is that the tables are so close together there is not much room to move... and that the place doesn't take credit cards, and if you order a couple of things ala carte like we did, it really adds up... My short stack for buckwheat pancakes, scrambled egg whites, and OJ plus Jared's eggs over easy with hashbrowns, toast, and coffee cost us $32 before tip.  For breakfast?  Really?  And our waitress could've told us, but no...At least they made it easy by putting an ATM inside the restaurant now - too bad there is that additional $2.50 fee to use it.  Another difference I noticed is that OHOP offers only one single kind of syrup where IHOP offers many... and the pancakes are better at the latter as well.  The one thing that OHOP has going for them is their Dutch Baby - at least from the looks of it as I saw people around me ordering it.  I'll choose IHOP or one of the many locally owned breakfast places in the future before returning to OHOP.  It was $40 out the door for a simple breakfast for two today... Screw that!My favorite signs at TOPH:*Please turn cell phones off while dining at TOPH! (annoyed by and enjoyed by this sign)* No oatmeal during summer! (WTF! LOL!)* This room dedicated to my friend Stanley (the back room had a plaque...Stanley who? Kubrik? Roper? Steemer?...the mystery remains...)Retro diner meets whimsical, artsy cafe. The front room has a counter complete with beehived, geriatric waitresses. Back room, a little more modern with trippy artwork (floating pancakes on a checkered sidewalk...kinda Willie Wonka meets flour...glad I wasn't in my mushroom phase)We had the most delightful server, very accommodating, friendly and yes...beehived and geriatric. We ordered typical fare like eggs, bacon and such and yes, PANCAKES. The buttermilk pancakes did not disappoint though I do enjoy a slightly crispy edge on my flapjacks. Banana cakes were just sweet enough. Yummy! Prices, however, not so retro but not over the top.Loved our staycation, loved my cakes, loved the architecture but not loving the $2.50 ATM charge because they don't accept credit or debit cards. Sneaky pancake people!First off, I've read some of the comments about the "rules" being "crazy" - and I guess I'm just one of the growing minority that's actually OK with being without my cell phone for a few minutes...or, if i need to make a call, i take my call outside.  It's the rude & indignant that seem to be upset about this and the sad thing is, I've seen management remove people from the restaurant because the patron is incapable of following the simple rule of courtesy: no cell phones.Beyond that, if you can't put your cell phone down long enough to enjoy the best pancakes around, then you should probably take your happy a$$ down to Villiage Inn or some place that clearly tolerates you talking on your phone at full volume.The full stack of blueberry pancakes (with blueberries baked right in to the pancakes) and a side order of bacon (served up by Cat the Killer Waitress) is the best breakfast I can imagine.  And how about that blueberry syrup with a healthy dose of blueberry's?  this isn't just blueberry flavored syrup, there's more blueberries in the syrup!i've been coming here for years (and to the one on Greenway Parkway before it closed) and will continue to recommend it to people...along with the necessity to leave the technology at the door.  Gah, get over it people, it's time to eat food, not yap on your phone!  There are several other places you can go if you need to look (and apparently sound) important.Finally made it to the Original Pancake House, never been, but have heard they do carry a selection of different pancakes. I have wanted to check out this place, I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat, and though that this could be a cool place to check out, but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people, but on WEEKDAYS only, well guess this place is out of the BC loop.  When I 1st walked in a few things hit me1) Plenty of signs on the door, inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe it's a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint, but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard, yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner, white/cream and aqua colors, but like a 50's cool diner, this wasn't an new place3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones, um ok, I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation, but people can text, and well play games, my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game 4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away, but it was ok with us, had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how it's like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners.5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block, so I'm guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young hahaAlso, again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering, and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake, and I was interested in trying it, but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes, and it's not that I was in a rush I just wasn't into waiting 45 mins to try it, maybe call a head for it? After checking out the menu, and yes they have a few different types of pancakes, but nothing really wowed me, but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha that's what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries. The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup, for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup, I did ask for more, but it still wasn't enough, some/most of the pancakes were dry, and I don't like them that way, but the bacon was a thick slice bacon, so very good, bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever!   The home fries looked amazing, but they were under cooked, the potatoes were a little to hard for me. Service was slow, it was weekday morning, so the place was semi steady , we were not check on to see if we needed/wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front, kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing.  Glad I finally stopped by to check them out, but even with the few types of pancakes, I'm not sure I'll be back.Ok food.  I have been here 4-5 times since I moved here.  I like diners and this feels like an old time diner.  The food is edible if not great.  Today however will be my last visit.  The way I was  treated by the hostess made me turn around and leave.  I was headed for becoming a regular in spite of the fair to middling food and prices.  But she gave me the push I needed to find something better.  For these prices, I can definitely do better

I wish I had read one of the previous reviews about the owner....Until we received the bill, I thought the place was alright. I had forgiven the fact that the waiter spilled water all over my friend's wife's hands .. Twice.The chicken parm and gnocchi was pretty delicious, I must say. I tried my friend'a chicken marsala and it, besides the carrots and broccoli that came with it, was pretty lousy.Things turned very sour when we got the bill. My buddies Marsala and my parm each included a side of spaghetti. He asked if there was an upcharge to switch to angel hair. They said no we can substitute it. I ordered next and didn't ask about an upcharge, but asked if I could swap for gnocchi. The guy said sure. My friends wife changed her spaghetti, to one with a meat sauce. Again, no mention of an additional costs.When the bill came, there was an $8 charge for meat sauce and $9 for gnocchi. The server played dumb with us so we asked for the manager... I calmly explained that wanted substitutions and had no intentions of paying for an upgrade. We were never made aware that we would be spending an additional $17 (the price of one full dinner) on substitutions. I also explained that any server I've ever encountered told us when additional fees apply to substitutions and ask if it's okay....Her response?"Well, did you eat it already?"I couldn't believe it. I've never met such an arrogant manager who didn't hear us out. We had already spent $100 on the meal, it wasn't about the money. It was about the fact that they failed to acknowledge that they charge heavily for substitutions.It's terrible that they've been getting away with such rude behavior and poor service. Zero tip and never visiting again. Thank you Yelp!

Seems that the entree's are about $5 more than you'd pay elsewhere, but you're paying extra for the atmosphere.  However, if you plan on eating inside, be prepared that the noise level may be quite loud, as it echoes.You never know when you'll find yourself sitting akin to a 'girls night out' table, with several shrill voices.Their flavorful pork verde will bring us back, but next time we'll wait for the patio.I came here with a big group on a Friday for happy hour.  Our waitress was awful.  It took forever to get a drink, and I was only the third person to arrive and the place was still empty!The food was okay, but I wish there was smaller options, especially for a happy hour.  The drinks too were just okay.The real problem was with our bill.  For about 12 of us, it came out to be $800.00.  My friend and her mom split a meal.  When they brought it out on two plates, both of them started eating them.  After they were halfway done, the waitress informs them that one of those plates was actually for someone else.  Ok, fine, but that's not my friend's fault.  They should have either split up the one plate for them or not put two in front of them!  She asked the waitress to take it off the bill, and my friend was told to get out of her seat and go talk to the manager.  What?!  Then the manager told her that since she ate it, she should have to pay for it.  I have never heard someone act so rudely as a manager!  He should have easily taken the $15 off from our $800 bill!  I would never come here again.

I'm currently in the middle of a rigorously controlled scientific experiment...it involves subjecting a "youngish" middle aged man to periods of intense physical exercise to "detoxify" him and then "retoxifying" him with things like Long Wong hot dogs and wings, mere moments later:)After Power Yoga on Friday, I really needed to "tox up" and I met a buddy at Long Wongs.I had my standard...2 Long Wongs and a frosty diet beverage, and my buddy got a dozen spicy and a dozen teryaki wings (and I thought I could eat:)I had not tried the wings before, so I did end up "helping" to dispose of them:)I am not generally a major fan of wings, but these little chicken parts were really good...esp. the teryaki wings...wonderfully deep teryaki flavor and a nice heat to go with it:)And, in a major coup for a real "hole in the wall" kind of place...they proudly display the "Gold Award  - Zero Violations" from their last health inspection...I always knew they were clean as whistle...even though I can still smell the urinal cakes:) Let's take them to 4 stars for the terrific teryaki wings:-)

Review Text :
Went here for V-day with the wife and both of us were pretty impressed.  I still can't get over the fact that THIS place is at the Four Queens!  Table side salad was great..we just got everything on it..can't remember the last time I had anchovies in my salad but it was pretty good.  The wife went with the beef wellington and I got the rack of lamb which were both fantastic.  They gave us 2 complimentary desserts.  One was a plate of things dipped in chocolate and the other was 2 chocolate coated gelatos shaped into hearts.  Dropped a little over a $100 for everything but I found it to be well worth it.I was worried after reading so many recent reviews of this place that said Hugo's was going downhill (even from some that had been coming here for years) that this place was going to suck bigtime.  Well...this is pretty damn good if this is downhill.Vegas is filled with steakhouses.  Palazzo, alone, has three of them.  So with so many options on the strip, its going to have to take a pretty good recommendation for me to stray off the strip for my savory appetite.  Hugo's cellar was recommended to us by one of our customers and he mentioned that it was one of the best steaks he has ever had.  Big words, when it comes to steak in Vegas (..and it was mentioned to us during dinner at Delmonico's).  Nonetheless, my girlfriend and I made it our mission to try Hugo's the next time we were in Vegas.  Here is the short of it:Pros:Your lady friend gets a rose when you enter the restaurant.  The amount of food you get for 50 dollars (steak) is a lot.  You get bread, chocolate covered strawberries, salad, and potatoes or vegetables.Reasonably priced compared to most, if not all a la carte steakhousesCons:Decor is more old school (or hasn't been changed in a while).  Fits in well with the Fremont street casinos.The steak and the meal were just OK for me.  I definitely left full but I wouldn't necessarily say it was melt in your mouth or the steak was anything to write home about.  Vegas Cons: In a city where image can be anything, this place just doesn't cut it.  Its in a cellar and it is on Fremont street.  There are so many other choices in Vegas that can give you a better view, or a more comfortable seating, or give you better recognition or name.  The crowd is older, not as dressy and fits more with the surroundings.  I wore dark jeans and a nice shirt (standard guy-wear) and I felt overdressed.  In the end though, I would eat there again.  However, one has to understand the type of meal you are getting and what you are paying for.  With that in hand, its one of the best deals on the strip.Now this is a Hidden Gem! Found in the 4 Queens Hotel & Casino, Downtown Vegas. Take steps down to the Underground Dungeon of a True Throw Back in Time Vegas Mob Style Dining Area.Every Lady that steps foot in here, receives a long stem red rose.. Brownie points already! We didn't have a reservation but we were given a table in literally a minute and the place was filled. The host was a jokester, had a great sense of humor that definitely set a positive vibe and loosened things up.  2 Servers(1 Server & 1 Assistant Server, Not Busser) immediately pulled out our chairs, and greeted us with much enthusiasm! Without wasting time, they poured their own in-house bottled water into our glasses. Within seconds, our bread basket (basic dinner rolls and  lavash) was dropped off with butter that had been intricately sculpted into a rose bud! Menu offered a wide variety and every other entree I grazed at was so appealing. But I was sold on their 21 Day Dry Aged Top Shelf Rib Eye that is char-broiled and served with mushroom ragout and bordelaise sauce.  My girl orders Hugo's Chicken - breast of chicken stuffed with a sun dried tomato pesto and roasted garlic sauce. Both dishes included sides of veggies and mashed potatoes. Not only that, the order also came with their Custom Made Salad and Dessert!!!!! Shortly after, a gentleman with this hunky salad cart rolled over and started to toss the  salad and asked what additions I cared for, about 15 different options! I added, creamy pepper dressing, onions, tomato, egg, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, parmesan cheese and croutons (they had anchovies and nuts too..). The lettuce, onions, extremely juicy tomato was farm picked fresh, artichoke hearts and hearts of palms added that lucious subtle flavor, egg, parmesan cheese and croutons just complemented each other wonderfully!! This disappeared in minutes.. Then one of the servers handed us over a tiny ice cream cone with a scoop of raspberry sorbet! Nice!About 10 minutes later, the servers came over with our piping hot plates of steak and chicken. The Steak was a chunky piece of meat that had Flawless grill marks checkered throughout. Fork tender and their mushroom/bordelaise aujus makes this Steak Unrivaled by Most Other Rib Eye's I've Ever Had!The chicken had an aroma that filled the air with garlic and sundried tomatoes. As good as it smelled, it tasted even better! The stuffing/sauce flavors were expertly balanced with the chicken. Undeniably recommended!The included sides were small but were a satisfying amount of vegetables, mash potato and pamesan crusted tomato that were all very good.When we were done, the servers boxed our leftovers and bagged them for carry-out.Next came the dessert tray, with an assortment of divine looking Treats.. We passed since we had our Chocoloate Covered/Dipped Strawberries, figs and apricot with their homemade whipped cream to come to the rescue! It came swiftly on this propped up cake stand, exactly what we needed to end the night right! Semi-sweet chocolate, flavorful fruits and fluffy whipped cream equals dessert Greatness!What an Experience! This place has Romance written all over it! Candle-lit dim dining room, Accomodating A+ Service, and Most Importantly this place doesn't Break the Bank! Just be cautious not to crack open too many bottles of Wine!!Hugo's is just top notch. They give all ladies who enter a rose and the butter is even rose shaped. The best for me is the table-side salad. I mean this is the best salad I have ever eaten and soooo fresh.I recommend this place for any type of romantic dinner. Great place for prom dates, anniversaries and so on.I do recommend wearing nice attire as the place is very upscale.Also, average of about $50-60 a person but worth it!Hugo's Cellar is still the premier downtown classic dining den where continental cuisine is served, and table-side service is the norm rather than the exception.  Ladies still receive a long-stemmed rose, a palate cleanser is offered just before entrees are served, and complimentary chocolate-covered fruits are bestowed in abundance at meal's end.  All I missed was French Onion Soup Gratinee.  Alas, it is not served here.To begin at the beginning, my party of four enjoyed Cheese-Toasted Lavosh and Sourdough Rolls with rosettes of butter, before some of us shared a very good Shrimp Cocktail.  But only 3 shrimps were presented for $16, along with a nice traditional Cocktail Sauce and a Thousand Island type dressing.  These were followed by an excellent complex salad prepared with a choice of Caesar, Peppercorn, or Honey Raspberry Orange Walnut Vinaigrette Dressing.  I recommend the latter, which was light, flavorful, and interesting with its different fruity notes.  A diner has 20 ingredients from which to pick, including Romaine lettuce, pine nuts, hearts of palm, tomatoes, Parmesan Cheese, shrimp, mushrooms, croutons, anchovies, bell pepper, red onions, and egg.   An Intermezzo of Lemon Sorbet was a refreshing change of pace before we launched into our entrees.  I had an excellent, perfectly cooked medium-rare Fillet Atlantis, which is similar to Filet Oscar, but here the Filet Mignon is surrounded by Crab Claws.  Except the claws were ice cold on arrival.  An offer to flash heat my entree was accepted, and it yielded beneficial results.  On return the crab meat was hot, and the smooth Bearnaise Sauce tasted great.  Mixed vegetables on the plate, including cooked tomatoes, were good, and Boiled Parsley Red Potatoes and mushrooms were very good.  But, based on the little crab provided, I didn't feel it was really worth the additional cost.While it is not necessary to purchase a dessert, a pyramid of Caramel Chocolate Mousse with sweet Whipped Cream was really luscious.  But it resulted in a few Chocolate-Covered Figs and Strawberries being left behind on their plate.It is fairly dark inside (It is a cellar, after all!), and the ambiance is romantic.  Service was formal, attentive, and professional.  Food is pricey, but the cost of entrees is discounted 20% for each diner who is age 55 or over and presents a Four Queens Club 55 player's card.  Thus, a Fillet Atlantis that is normally sold for $60.00 is reduced to $48.00 for young seniors.4-1/2 stars overall, and still very much downtown Vegas's diamond in the rough!We ate here last night and, sad to say, it was less than stellar. We called for a reservation at 5 hoping to get in at 7:00. It was short notice I know. At first, Rich, the manager said not until 9:00. I said ok we'll go somewhere else. Then he said we could come at 6:30. Great! I wish we hadn't gotten in.Let me start off my saying this is not a cheap restaurant by any means and we knew that. When we walked in as per usual, they gave me a rose. They give Roses to all the female guests.We ordered drinks which were fine. A little light, but not bad. For an appetizer, we had the escargot which was really good. I was none to pleased when the dirty dishes remained on our table for an extended length of time. I finally stacked them and put them by the edge of the table hoping one of the 3 people taking care of us would notice.Erik was our head waiter. He disappeared and I called over Oscar to order a bottle of wine. He stated he could not take orders for bottles of wine only the Sommelier could. We had to wait for him. That was about a 15 minute wait. I've known the sommelier there for years and mentioned to him I wasn't too pleased with the service so far. He said I should tell Rich, the manager. I decided to wait it out and see how things progressed. They went downhill from there.I ordered the Veal Oscar and my husband ordered the filet. First, they give you a salad made table side. It is fine. It is a lettuce salad with your choice of dressing and toppings. My veal came and it was awful. It tasted fishy. I didn't say anything to my husband, but told him to try a bite. He said the identical thing. I tried his steak. It was dry on the ends and you needed a lot of sauce to get it down.I had to track down Erik again as I was not paying $49 for bad veal. When I was able to get him and told him the veal was bad, he got rather indignant and stated that the only thing he could get to me was the prime rib. I guess it was sitting there. I did not want prime rib. He got very angry, took the plate and walked away. I just shared my husband's steak with him.I told John, the sommelier, about the altercation with the waiter. He said to tell Rich. I told Rich what happened and even he didn't offer me something I would like better. He said he would give me his card before I left for a free meal. Yeah right. This meal should have been free. They gave us a desert for our anniversary and you could tell it was not fresh, it had been pulled from the freezer. There was ice falling off of it.We got the bill and they did take the drinks and my veal off, but charged us $17.00 for the salad that was supposed to come with the meal and that was just wrong!Before he delivered the bill, Erik came back as I'm sure he was told to by the manager to  make it right. Instead he began arguing with me. Hey jerk I'm the customer.So for one entree and one desert we ended up with a $129.00 bill. Of course, I couldn't find Erik again to discuss the charge for the salad. On the bill, there is a place for 2 tips. One for the server and one for the sommelier. I gave john 20% of what the wine cost. I gave Erik $1. He didn't deserve anything. Never saw the manager again either. So much for the card for the meal.  This was totally unacceptable for a restaurant of their caliber. I've been eating here since the 1980's, but I won't be going back. Too many other good restaurants in Vegas to choose from. This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Vegas!Items Selected:Tom CollinsGin-Lemon-SevenButter Rose, White Roll, Cheese Lavosh, Whole Grain RollEscargot en Croute - Six plump escargots sautéed in shallots, garlic, burgundy wine, fine herbs with a puff pastry toppingTableside Salad - Romaine, Tomato, Hearts of Palm, Artichokes, Mushrooms, Blue Cheese, Croutons, Pine Nuts, Hardboiled Egg, Bay Shrimp with Creamy Pepper DressingRaspberry SorbetStuffed Jumbo Shrimp - Jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab, parsley, savory and 'old bay' seasoned bread crumbsDuckling Anise Flambé - Duck roasted with licorice spices and herbs; flambéed table-sideBeef Wellington - Filet of beef, topped with a duxelle of foie gras and mushrooms; baked in pastry and served with bordelaise sauceWhite and dark chocolate dipped strawberries, apricots and baby figs with whipped creamBananas FosterCherries JubileeLocated in The Four Queens on Fremont and considered by many to be the best "Old Vegas" experience remaining in a city once rife with dens of a similar ilk Hugo's Cellar had always been on my proverbial 'to-do' list and despite the constant onslaught of new spots from celebrity chefs on the Strip a Sunday night visit found the venerable institution packed - the 'reservations recommended' sign proving justified as couples attempting to walk-in met a two hour wait.  Dimly lit with stone walls, wood beams, heavy linens, and art-glass chandeliers overhead it was to formal greetings and a rose for the ladies that we arrived in the Cellar and whisked away soon to a booth in one of several rooms the action soon commenced, each waiter presented by name as a trio of warm breads with a butter rose plus the famous tableside salad engaged the senses - the later a true crowd pleaser carefully customized for each and every guest.  Large in menu with a bar that promised to craft "anything you like" it was with a stiff pair of $7 cocktails that our proper order progressed and soon plucking tender snails under delicate pastry from their dish one really couldn't help but smile at a classic done so well, a theme continued with each of three superlative entrees following a raspberry palate cleanse - the tableside whole duckling a showstopper gathering looks from around the room while the Wellington rivaled that at Ramsay Steak beneath a pile of mushrooms and foie gras.  Truly a class act it was prior to desserts-proper that a trio of chocolate dipped fruits arrived to be dressed in hand-whipped cream and with more sweets offered on the house to celebrate a duo of birthdays it was tableside we turned again - the smolder and burn of booze, fresh fruit, and cinnamon ladled over rich ice cream a refined finish to a true 'experience.'Hidden gem on the old strip.  This place is pricy, I mean damned pricy, so be prepared for that.  Either hit the tables at the 4 Queens hard and often to get a meal comp'd or pony up for this great experience.  This is the quintessential 'old vegas' experience.  When you walk in, you can soak in the sight, sounds and smell and instantly wonder what it must have been like 60-70 years ago in that very spot.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  However, why not go after the real mccoy?  Get a bourbon on the rocks and one of their primo Filets.  They even give fresh roses to the lady in your life.  Surely, they will dig it as well.  Also worth noting - The Salad Cart.  Sounds odd...but do it.  You build your own creation table side and enjoy while the meal is being prepared.  Unlike the restaurants namesake...my review couldn't be any higher.  Visit Hugo's Cellar.First of all, this was my first "Old Vegas" dining experience and it was fantastic! I had SO much fun. It actually made me wonder why we started to move away from this type of dining. Thank goodness there are still places like this keeping it classic.The hotel offers free valet and self-parking (four hours with validation) and it's just a quick walk down Carson to Fremont.When you walk down the stairs from the casino floor, you really feel like you're in a cellar. There's a small lounge/bar area near the host stand. Even if you're here for dinner, I'd recommend some time at the bar with veteran bartender Dean. What a personality! Tell him what you're in the mood for or what you like to drink and he'll make you something new and name it on the spot. Your cocktails also come with their own refills - a beautiful crystal bucket filled with crushed ice and a carafe of whatever you're drinking. I had the Raspberry Lemon Drop and it was great; the right balance of sweet and liquor. Also only at the bar are complimentary mixed nuts, adorable heart-shaped water crackers, and spreads: Chicken Liver Pate and Smoked Cheddar with Bacon and Pimientos. The pate was amazing! I could have sat at the bar all night eating pate and crackers.If you're a lady, you receive a fresh red rose prior to seating. They even have vases at each table to place your rose(s) while dining. Then, when you're ready to leave, they wrap the stem in foil to take with you. They do this EVERY DAY! Want to know what you should eat? Anything that involves table-side service! After all, you're here for the Old Vegas experience. Gosh, it is so much fun. Especially if you have the honor of dining with server extraordinare Victor. He's been here since 1983 and you'd never guess it with the amount of enthusiasm he has for everything! We started with the Table-Side Salad (this comes with all entrees or $19 a la carte). The cart has all the salad elements and you tell your server what you'd like and they put it together. If you're with Victor, just have him make your salad. If you're not picky or allergic to anything, tell him to put whatever he wants. It's quite the show and he is extremely entertaining. I had a blast just watching him make the salad! And the salad had EVERYTHING. Romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, mushroom, anchovies, bay shrimp, marinated artichoke, hearts of palm, hard-boiled egg, parmesan, blue cheese, roasted pine nuts, and croutons. There are three dressings: Caesar, Creamy Pepper, and Honey Orange Walnut Vinaigrette. Victor recommends an unique combination of all three, so of course, I said yes. The salad was delicious. This is a must!We shared the Duckling Anise Flambé ($40). The duck is roasted with licorice spices and herbs, then flambéed table-side. More of that table-side action. It's also topped with a Grand Mariner duck confit mandarin orange sauce. Served with wild rice and roasted vegetables. The duck was delicious and I loved the sauce. All entrees come with bottled water, assorted breads (cheese-toasted lavosh and rolls) and rose-shaped butter, their famous table-side salad, fruit sorbet as a palate cleanser (we got adorable mini cones topped with lemon sorbet), fresh vegetables, choice of roasted garlic whipped potatoes, red potatoes with parsley, or wild rice, and chocolate-dipped fruit (strawberries, baby figs, and dried apricots). I mean, WOW. We finished with Bananas Foster ($18 for 2 people) which is also flambéed table-side. Served with vanilla ice cream in a beautiful goblet and long, slender spoon. YUM.It was an amazing meal and even better experience. I really didn't understand the hoopla, but now I get it. Service was IMPECCABLE. Each table has TWO servers and a bus boy. Everyone is so professional, crazily attentive, and importantly, thrilled to be there. Our drinks were never empty, our table was always clean, and one time I didn't even realize I dropped my napkin when I stood up and before I knew it, there was a new, folded napkin waiting for me on the table! By the way, if you weren't impressed enough, all the servers have culinary training for their table-side cooking! I truly cannot wait to come back - no need to wait for a special occasion!Notes: They tend to get busy every night, so reservations are recommended in advance. It's a popular spot for locals and visitors!Quick Takeaway:Enjoy a piece of 'Old Vegas' charm in the 'cellar' of the Four Queens. Expect a romantic atmosphere--- dimly lit cozy tables--old style service with personable waiters who have been there for years--complementary long stem rose for the lady- low music- great food. Relax, unwind, snuggle up and prepare for a feast! Make reservations and request a private table in the back and soak it all in. Worth it? Yes! Tableside salad; perfectly cooked steaks and sides; tableside cherries jubilee; Kona coffee brewed at your table--- this place it sure to sweep you off your feet. I felt like I was transported back to the 'Old Vegas' days. It's pricey. However, it was worth every penny and I'm confident you will be swept away in the whole dining experience and romantic atmosphere. This spot is a classic  treat-yo-self kinda' place! Loved it and I can't wait to treat out of town clients, family and friends to this spot!Service: Victor was our server and he was great! He was attentive but he never hovered. My husband and I were all smiles while he perfectly crafted our salads and kept good conversation. We never once had to ask for anything and he was on top of his game.  Overall:This was my first time experiencing an "Old Vegas" style dinner. My husband knows I'm a foodie and planned a special evening here for my birthday. We went all out and ordered steaks, cherries jubilee, Kona coffee and we had our feast and plenty of leftovers (photos and video included). I was 'wowed' and enjoyed my night out. All of this doesn't come cheap (expect 100 a person if you're going all out). It was worth every penny and is worth checking out for your own 'treat-yo-self' night on the town.Will Never ReturnAs local foodies, we enjoy all the wonderful restaurants Vegas offers. Hugo's has been one of our favorites for 15 years. You could imagine our disappointment when 7 of us dined & were not able to order an appetizer along with our drinks without first ordering our meal. The assistant manager begrudgingly agreed after much discussion to grant us that request. It took 20+ minutes to receive, during a not-packed evening. Our servers were apologetic & attentive as usual despite that Jon, our favorite sommelier, was not there. My husband was ready to call Andiamo's at the D where we had had a terrific dinner for 10 a few weeks before. After dinner we requested our leftovers but when we got home, we found just a portion in each box. Normally, I'd ignore that but not after the condescending, boorish treatment by the assistant manager earlier. He responded scoffingly: Do you expect me to drive over & deliver them? I responded that I wanted the manager to call me the next day so I could explain the evening's experiences. Well, it's been 11 days. I get your message loud & clear, Mr. Assistant. Instead of Hugo's we will dine with friends, business clients & family at our other favorite restaurants: Bouchon, T-Bones, Andiamo's, Botero, & so many others.What a gem. I was pretty blown away by Hugo's in every way possible. Perhaps my expectations were low or it was just really great. Now, I'm not exactly sure what "old Vegas" felt like, but the food and service that Hugo's provided was what I would have imagined "old Vegas" to be like. I would advise that you make reservations. There was a couple of men who walked up to the host just before we did and they were told the wait would be at least 2 hours. It was my boyfriend's birthday and each year, I try to find a local gem to take him to - something that was different than the usual Strip offerings. Prior to September 2015, I had never even heard of Hugo's. I found it on Yelp and after reading the many positive reviews, I decided we had to go. I have never ventured into a Downtown casino and thought that the parking situation would be similar to the ones on the Strip. Drive in through the front and either valet or self park. Not really the case here. Hugo's is located inside the Four Queens Hotel & Casino. Google Maps and Waze directs you to the front entrance on Fremont. All parking, however, is on Carson. Because of this, we were 10 minutes late getting to Hugo's, Even so, the host had a sense of humor about it and gave us a choice between a cozy booth or a table. After we selected the booth, he plucked out a beautiful, long-stemmed red rose from a basket of roses and presented it to me (as they do to every lady dining at Hugo's). The restaurant itself isn't huge. It is dimly lit and the decor really is reminiscent of "old Vegas" in a glamorous and romantic way. The waitstaff was all dressed in tuxes and fairly mature. Our server was Michael. He took the time to explain and validate our meal choices by telling us how great the dishes were, and the care it took to prepare those dishes. For the appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. Let me tell you...they were the best crab cakes we had ever had. Moderately-sized patties made of lump crab meat with just the right amount of crust. It came with some kind of aioli but I honestly couldn't tell you about it. I just remember the crab cake. I didn't want it to end. Once the appetizer has been cleared comes the salad cart which comes with every entree. A different waiter wheeled the cart over to our table, gave us each our choice out of 4 different dressings. Then they go through the cart, asking you which ingredients you want/don't want. Once you've picked everything, the salad is tossed and served in front of you. It was a pretty good portion of a very delicious salad.Now getting to the best part. I ordered the Beef Wellington. Michael recommended I get it medium rare, which I did and I have zero regrets. It was perfect. The puff pastry crust was flaky and moist, concealing the filet of beef topped by a piece of deliciously and politically incorrect food (foie gras). My boyfriend ordered the ribeye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. You'd think after all that food, we would have been too full for anything else. You're dead wrong. We each had a cappuccino and were going to call it quits until a server brought over the dessert tray. We couldn't turn down the chocolate lava cake and I'm glad we didn't. Gluttonous? Definitely. Worth it? Oh yea.Also, when Michael took our payment, he also offered to validate our parking ticket. We, in our food-induced fog, would have forgotten to validate. 5 stars for the food. 5 stars for the service.This is my second trip to Hugo's Cellar, once again this place amazed us with its perfection in  food skills and top notch service.However, there was one issue that grinds on me. the wait staff who for the most part have 15 to 30 year here.. I asked. One of my guest was not how we say, fancy. he had questions and was kind of giddy to be BACK IN THIS PLACE. You see I brought him here last year. we had a nice booth then and were treated very well, hence the return trip.The issue came with the waiter who I was told has been there 30 years and  this eve was on salad duty the waiter began to belittled my guest with subtle barbs implying he was a simpleton and not worthy of his service. Myself and one of the other in our party took exception to this. We didn't make a big deal about it as we were in a fine dining establishment and my customer, the target of his disrespect missed it. We spoke to the other waiter who took our order and served out main course he said some days your the front guy and some your the salad/drinks guy. The Sommelier was awesome also a 30 year veteran stopped in several times and even when we opted out on the wine he was very cordial and polite.The true sad part about this is I was the guest this time and the gentleman who was insulted without his knowledge was the one paying the bill this night. Looks like next year we will be looking for a new meat house Maybe Smith & Wollensky.What in the blue hell are you thinking my fellow food critics ?!!!! If Hugo's is a 4.5 star steakhouse than you may as well throw me in the kennel and lock up the key because this has got to be the most overrated and overpriced restaurant in las Vegas. I spent weeks deciding on where to eat to celebrate my cousin's engagement. after much deliberation I settled on Hugo's because everyone recommended the place from our hotel concierge  to the Yelp community. Well I should have known when the restaurant  asked me for my credit card number upon making a reservation that this was going to totally suck. Should have listened to my instincts....We started with the mixed meat grill which consisted of a bunch of undercooked meats that they bring out on a sizzling platter. Nothing was seasoned at all so the meat itself tasted bland and dull. Plus the chicken was undercooked when they brought it out so we had to kind of guess when it was ready to eat. The various dipping sauces that came out with the platter were just entirely overpowering and the dish itself was just a pointless and lazy way to serve meats at a high end restaurant like Hugo's. Since we were a party of 7 people it was at this point that I began to worry that the rest of the meal would go downhill. Once again I was right... The table side salad was a complete f^*%%ing joke. I'm angry just typing this out. It's like the salad bar they used to have at sizzlers except a waiter is actually mixing ingredients into your custom salad. The ingredients were cheap and pathetic. My shrimp were smaller than toe nail clippings. The lettuce was wilted and The salad itself wasn't even tossed well AT ALL. I basically had a glob of dressing that never made its way onto any of the lettuce.  Everyone hated their salad. Nuff said...Next We proceed to the entrees and nothing improves. I ordered the tenderloin and shrimp both of which were drowning in a cream sauce. The shrimp themselves were actually cooked well. They were also deveined. My steak was small and bland once again. Albeit there was no fat which I will say was nice. The veggies on the plate were a complete afterthought and the mashed potatoes tasted like Ora Ida box mix. I was too embarrassed to ask how everyone else's meal was but judging by the half eaten plates i don't think a single person enjoyed their meal here. The assorted chocolate covered fruits at the end were a nice gesture but unfortunately they did not make up for the lackluster meal our party was served that evening. I love old school steakhouses but only if it's done right. This was not done right. The fact that we were the last table in there on a Saturday night at 10pm was probably a bad sign. Oh and the fire alarm went off twice during our meal. The staff never came over to apologize so we basically sat at our table and listened to that loud noise for a good 15 minutes. It was probably a sign from God that i made a fatal mistake by eating here. Never again.

I actually got great bar service here at an event recently. A Scottsdale bar full of silicon and gym beefcake is usually hard to compete against. But I learned this middle aged gay guy with a receding hairline can hold his own against the vacuous Scottsdale hipsters. Of course it didn't hurt that I purposefully over tipped on my first round and realized if you step real hard, ever so slyly, on some bitches big toe, she tends to move out of the way. I thought the lay of the land (no pun intended, no, actually, pun intended) was pretty dang cool. The fire stands on the patio were awesome. Comfortable furniture strewn about was a nice place to plop after trying to keep up with the hip hop music. What no Pet Shop Boys or Cyndi Lauper. Damn! I ran up a pretty hefty bar tab...$140...no big surprise there. I mean on the prices people. Not on the quantity consumed. And certainly I was buying drinks for others. So, I won't go out of my way to go here, but adaptable Sagitarriun that I am, I can kick it anywhere and have a good time.

I was craving a yummy breakfast close to Henderson but away from the chain restaurants like IHOP and Denny's or any buffet. I was looking for something local and good and I remember I had bookmarked Rainbow Club & Casino after reading that there was a dinner inside that served really decent food.Located on Water Street in downtown Henderson it was close to home and easy to find. The casino was small, very local and quaint. The dinner is located towards the back but there is not much walking to do as the place is not very large. The restaurant is called Images. The staff is very friendly. We were seated right away, it was around 8am and the place was packed. By the time we left there was people waiting in line waiting to get in, I don't blame them...it's worth the wait!I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the menu. Breakfast Casino   specials starting at $1.89!!! There are $5 lunch special with soup or salad and half sandwiches. Dinners specials every day for less than $8  like juicy Prime Rib on Tuesdays and Saturdays and Steak and Shrimp on Wednesdays. This occasion I was craving the NY Steak and Eggs for only $6.25!!! It was delicious, it came with hash browns and my choice of toast or biscuits.The food was amazing, the prices you couldn't beat, the staff was super quick and friendly and the restaurant was clean and amazingly I didn't get a headache from excessive cigarette smoke. I will definitely be coming back to try out their other specials :)If you've been in Vegas more than 5 years, and DON'T know about The Rainbow in old school Henderson and their awesome cheap food and drinks- well we just can't be friends. Or you can go now, get full and drunk for $20 or less, and then write me and thank me. My first trip here was WAAAAYYY back in my teenage years when I worked at In-N-Out Burger. We would get off work at 2am, and go enjoy a $1 breakfast. Meat, hashbrowns, eggs, and toast or biscuits and gravy. Since then the price has raised a bit, but not much. I can still get the same deal for about $3 and I think $4 on the weekends. Also, their lunch and dinner is beyond decent for the price. Basic diner/café style grub, good quality and super cheap prices. The same staff has worked there for years. A double bloody mary cost $6. It is just a delicious, low cost, locals spot. I feel comfortable showing up in my sweats, or a cocktail dress.If you go on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait, but the breakfast bar is almost always available for small parties. The casino is a bit smoky, but not as bad as some small Vegas casinos. The actual diner is called Images, and that is for sure a change made within the last year. I am glad there is still a place where I can feed my family at a sit down restaurant for $40. That is very rare these days, so I will enjoy it while I can!Tired of when the dining environment becomes overcast with many restaurants charging so much for so little? If so, there is a rainbow at the end of the overcast dining environment.    The Rainbow Club has been a downtown Henderson institution since 1984 when the Peppermill Group brought it. For over thirty years, the Rainbow Club has been serving quality food at old school prices.    Oftentimes, good things come in small packages. The Rainbow Club is an infinitesimal property that fits into a small downtown Henderson block. It is primarily a casino, bar, and restaurant. The best way to describe the Rainbow Club is as three long rectangles. The casino is one rectangle. The long bar in the center is the second rectangle. And the long and skinny restaurant in the back, which is Images is the third rectangle. Images (the only restaurant) with its long and skinny layout reminds me of a railroad dining car.    Over a couple of handful of times recently, I have dined in the Rainbow Club. I would experience four different items from the menu: 1) chicken parmesan with pasta, 2) meat loaf, 3) chicken fettuccine, 4) and Cajun chicken pasta. Every single one of these dishes exemplified a fantastic deal. The highest price is  $7.75. Where else in Vegas can you enjoy a chicken parmesan dinner for $7.75? The Rainbow gives a large portion. I remember last visit, bringing half of the chicken fettuccine home. The food that they give so much of is quality. At the Rainbow quantity equals quality. With the entre, the Rainbow includes either a soup or salad. One weakness in regards to the salad is there is a want for tomatoes. At the Rainbow, the service has also been right on.   The Rainbow may not be a gold rush to gamblers, but it is a mellow place to play at the bar. Several monitors hang over the long bar that turns the place into a professional sports entertainment center. The place comes alive during the NFL games. Just like the food, the drink prices are old school. $1.75 for a bottle of Budweiser is a gold rush for beer drinkers. As far as video Keno, they seem to target the nickel domination over quarters. Mellowed out after a tasty inexpensive meal that followed an outdoor adventure, I enjoyed quaffing a beer while looking up at the professional sports game, looking down at the dime Caveman Keno that kept my money in action and listening to the oldies and locals joke with the bartender.   If you want to experience one of the greatest restaurant values in town, then just follow the Rainbow.

I used to go to this restaurant, long ago.I stopped going to this one long ago.That's because of the following event:I had taken a large group of people there for a get together including my entire family.  We placed our orders, the waitress got us our drinks, our food was brought to us in a reasonable amount of time..........but.  She brought us no napkins.  We were eating BBQ, you MUST have napkins with BBQ.  Well, we were eating it anyway without them.  Eventually, our drinks ran out - me and BBQ? Must have fluid, lots of fluid!This was going on 25 minutes without a waitress showing up and I finally got up and got the napkins.  I then started refilling the drinks at the counter.  Yup, just helped myself.  Dunno what happened to the waitress, but this deal was beginning to put a damper on the festive spirit and I was determined to deal with it myself.Well, that got that attention of management, who came storming over and demanding to know what I was doing there.  I looked at this guy square in the eye and asked him why he hadn't been so incredibly concerned about the service at our table - which was non-existent - if he was paying so much damned attention to what I was doing at the drink bar which is supposed to be for employees."Where's our waitress? It's been 30 minutes now and no sign of her, we have been waiting for napkins and refills, I finally decided to get them myself since YOUR employees aren't going to do it for us".  You wanna know what happened to our waitress?  REEEEEEEALLY? HER SHIFT WAS OVER AND SHE WENT HOME!!!!  I can laugh about it now, I was PISSED at the time.  This woman just up and left us stranded.  We had JUST started eating when she had dumped the food on our table and took off.  It's not like we had been sitting there for half the night and it was time for us to leave.  This stupid manager still had tude' written all over his face.  His apology was pathetic.  His offer of a "free dessert" was even more atrocious.  Give me 50% off the meal and I'll be happy.  We didn't eat their free dessert, everyone at the table was equally as appalled at this restaurant, that manager and the waitress.  I footed the bill and we left and I have NEVER gone back to that place.Edited: Here's the really funny part for me: I am a REALLY good tipper when I get great service.  Not unusual for me to dole out 25 to 30% tip regardless of how large the bill is.  I was at Denny's the other day and got SUCH great service for the kind of place it is, I tipped $25 for a $11 meal, lol.  Hey, you gotta tip em'.  They aren't making any kind of hourly wages, what is it, $4.00 per hour?  Just throwing that in there, if you are going to go to a restaurant and you get good or even okay service, PLEASE tip that person.  Without the tips, they sink. Well, when your waitress goes home and you get a manager with a pathetic attitude, what do you tip?  Yup, the age-old penny.  If I'm going to be insulted, I'm going to dole it out right back to em'.

When I feel like living on the edge. You know, doing something dicey. Entering a neighborhood you wouldn't normally dare to cross. I go to South Scottsdale. Ooooo....yea, that's right. Not North. Not Oldtown. But that seedy stretch called SoSco. And when I'm there Flicka's is pretty dang fun. Kind of a weird sports, meets ASU, meets the gays (oh, well when I'm there with my gang anyway) crowd. Music is loud. Dance floor gets jammin. Lots of hip hop. And lots of hip hop moves. And then there's me. Yes. Me. Doing the running man. I can't help myself. What? The sprinkler. Sure, why not. They have buckets of Coronas and really great chicken taquitos. Servers are usually the hottie chick types but always really friendly and efficient. I like hanging out on their huge patio and watching the Scottsdale Road action. So if you want to have a good time in SoSco, I say, picka a Flicka's!"Before both of my feet fully entered Flicka's, I knew I had already contracted the Swine Flu.." Thanks to Georgie S, I now know why I have a sore throat, cough and achy body. Thanks Flicka's for giving me Swine Flu. This place is really disorganized, the wait staff (the bartenders the waitresses the bussers) are all really snotty and were all rude, not to mention slow as the second coming. The nicest person in that bar was the little Mexican flower guy who fell in love with me and gave me a pair of roses, free of charge. The one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers. My Corona was $2.50 and the Bud Lights were $2. The outdoor patio is cool, but it is filled with all the smokers so unless you want to catch lung cancer, it is smart to just stay inside. My friends band played (I have seen them play at least a dozen times in a variety of venues) and the sound was so horrible. You couldn't hear vocals at all. In between the 5 rock bands that played, they piped R&B music over the speakers. I thought this was a little strange.... and I also found the massive dance orgy that busted out to be a little strange.Some dude sent his wing-woman over to the bar while I was getting drinks to try and get me to join their table. She was the oldest looking wing-woman I have ever seen. It made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership. What a really weird group of people here. Seriously. I didn't really care for the food. I consider myself a nachos connoisseur now that I date Dallas G, and these nachos were sub-par. I highly doubt I will ever be back to this weird ass place!

This used to be one of my favorite haunts in old town until the owners split up and one opened Ciba.  The food is still pretty good, but the quality is not what it used to be.  Still worth the time.  It is a nice cozy restaurant with good service, nice ambiance and great salads.Finally visited Grazie this past Tuesday after years of wanting to try it!  A few months ago (perhaps a year??), I won a giftcard from a fave radio station, and I thought that I'd use it before Grazie closes like so many restaurants are doing these days.  Should Grazie ever find itself closing, it WILL NOT be because of lackluster food... I fell head over heels in love with their Cinque formaggi!   I watched the pizzaiolo knead and hand-toss the dough, roll it out thinly, and then grab handfuls of mozzarella, gorgonzola (sigh!), ricotta (sigh!), provolone, and parmigiano reggiano (oh!).  He garnished the pizza with a sprig of basil leaf and some olive oil, and then slid it into the brick oven.  Ten minutes later, after I took a couple of photos, I had a bite of my first slice of pizza (I eventually had three- no, scratch that- four slices!) and I could've sworn I had walked through heaven's gates!  If you love all-cheese, no red sauce thin-crust pizzas, you must try this!  My one grievance (and it's a big one!) is that the body of the crust didn't stay crispy for long, but that is understandable with all the cheese placed onto it!!  The rim parts of the crust stayed very crispy, though.  No worries- I concentrated on these areas, while I ditched the soggy parts, but there was no way I'd throw any of the cheeses away (well, ok, maybe the mozzarella, which took on a rubbery texture).  The leftovers reheated well in the toaster oven the next day- a good thing to know.  BTW, I was able to sample a few sips of three white wines before settling with a glass of Anselmi.  This paired very well with the slices of cinque formaggi.Note: I had asked for table bread and some olive oil and herbs, which the server obliged with a platter of spongy bread, not toasted, and bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I'm not a fan of eating spongy bread (unless it's Ethiopian injera) un-toasted, so I took the pieces home to toast them up later.  (They were really good with ricotta, Medjool dates, and some AZ pistachios!)Friendly service; clean restroom.  Not a lot of tables, or space for that matter, indoors, and I visited around 4p, so it was practically empty- there was one man waiting for his partner to arrive, besides me- so it was very quiet.  I'd wager that this place can get pretty noisy when packed...  Ample patio space, though.(Pizza didn't re-heat well at home.  So you better plan on sharing the pizza at the restaurant so that there won't be any leftovers to toss out the next day.)8/14Went for dinner.  Wanted to dine inside as it was still very warm outside, but the noise level there was ridiculous (and it wasn't even half-full!), so I asked for patio-seating.  Service from my server was very spotty- I only saw her when she took my order, the return visit to see if I needed anything, and at the end, when I asked for the bill.  It took more than 15 minutes to get the bill, and when she did arrive with it- I paid w/ a giftcard- the credit balance was missing on the receipt, so I had to wait another ten minutes before finally going in myself to look for her.Had the Vegetariana pizza, which came with mozz, provolone, Parmigiano reggiano, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers ($13).  Still lovin' the crispy thin-crust!  However, it seemed like the pizzaiolo took a light hand with the vegetables and cheeses.  I consumed all but one slice's worth of toppings and all the crispy bits of crust my hands could find in the very low-light surroundings (I apologize for the dark photo), and I didn't even feel guilty afterwards!  As I said, I rarely saw my female server, and most of my interactions were with the busser, who brought: ice water to me after I had been sitting outside for about 15 minutes, with my pizza order already placed 5 minutes ago; a candle when it became too dark to see; and table bread when I asked for it.  Three stars for the tasty pizza, even with such little toppings.  Had to dock a star bec. of the cheesy (pun intended) service from the female server.This review gets one star in my book, solely based on the ghastly way we were treated by management after already receiving poor service all night.  Here's what happened...About a week prior to our visit, I called and made a dinner reservation for a table of 12 for the following Saturday night.  I requested a table outside, after confirming that there would be ample heaters should it get chilly.  I was told that would be no problem (on all counts), and the reservation was booked.  The day before our dinner, we had one more decide to join us.  I called the restaurant back, requesting that we add one more.  They again assured me that would be no problem, and confirmed the reservation on the patio, now for 13.Three of us arrived at Grazie about 30 minutes prior to our reservation time, expecting to get a glass of wine at the bar while we waited for our group to arrive.  The hostess informed us that the table was ready, and we could just sit there if we wanted.  No problem.  When we get to the table, the only heater close to us was off, so we asked if they could turn it on.  The hostess said she would send someone right out, and that our server would be with us shortly.  Twenty minutes later, the server came over and took our wine and appetizer order (mind you, the heater is still off at this point).  We asked her again if we could have someone turn it on, and she said she'd have someone come over.  Ten minutes later our group began to arrive...and we still hadn't even received so much as a glass of water.  After another 10 minutes or so, the wine and appetizers arrived....but no silverware.   We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our waitresses attention and request silverware, and get the rest of our party's drink orders in.  In addition, we asked for the heater to be turned on again.....Throughout dinner, service was incredibly slow, items were forgotten (my friend ordered a coffee, which came black - with no request of if she would like cream or sugar - and again it took forever to track down the server to get it)...After our 5th or 6th request to have the heater turned on, one member of the table actually went inside to ask someone else if we could get it turned on.  The waitress came back to the table and told us that the propane tank was empty, but they'd have another one moved over to our table (ummm why did they put out a heater with an empty propane tank in the first place??)..again, two or three requests later and the 'new' heater still had not been moved to the table.  All of a sudden, a busboy showed up with a lighter, and lit our ORIGINAL heater - apparently NOT empty, and about an hour and a half late.When we received the bill, an automatic 20% gratuity was added (due to the party's size) which we felt should be disputed based on the horrible service we had received thus far.  So two of us went inside to speak to a manager about our experience.  The owner, a fairly grumpy man, let us get out two words before he started spouting all the defenses he could think of as to why the service was bad...."short staffed, not enough silverware, busier than usual, etc".  Not once was there an apology for the service received.  At one point, he interrupted me (again) to say "what is it you want from me"...I said "i'd like you to at least listen to me.  You haven't let us finish a single sentence yet"....at which point he threw up his arms and said "i don't have time for this.  It's not my fault you had bad service, that's your server's fault".  I have to say, I was incredibly impressed at his quick willingness to throw the server under the bus after already stating they were "short staffed, etc".  He then motioned over a woman who I assume was a manager, although her attitude and statements were beyond unprofessional, and said "you take care of this" (motioning in our direction).  Up to this point, we had been calm, collected and polite, but this was too much.  The woman asked what we needed, and again (one final time) tried to explain the situation and the service we had received.  Without listening to a word, she jumped in and said "I'm sorry, but do you see how busy we are??  We are FUCKING awesome.  Maybe this isn't "Your" kind of establishment".  Our jaws dropped to the floor at the rediculous rudeness and COMPLETE lack of professionalism or customer service we were witnessing.  And let me state for the record that our group consisted of several high profile professionals in the scottsdale area that would potentially take clients there as well.  My friend, pissed beyond believe at this point, stated that we would most likely not be returning if this is how they treated their customers, and that our friends would be doing the same.  She replied with "that's fine with us, clearly you don't belong here".. And when we mentioned that we would be sharing this experience with others via Yelp and word of mouth, she said (sarcastically) "Oh please do"....So here I am.  DONT GO TO GRAZIE.Strolled in with a posse of 14 people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef "medium" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees....

Review Text :
What can I say? MEH.It's a diner themed to Indiana.  I'm amazed that they stay in business with that theme, but what the hey.The food is normal diner food, good and greasy, I love that old diner feel.  They have that (in my opinion) disgusting biscuits & gravy, which is designed to make Hooiser's the fattest people on earth.  I had bacon and eggs as I'm not Hoosier, I'm just a captive there.This place is ok, but I won't go there again.  I was brought here as a joke because I was visiting from Indiana.  There is nothing here that I can't get at 10,000 other places in Phoenix, except high cholesterol.Yay diner!  Four stars for the diner category. Basic food, good prices, service with a little good natured lip backatcha.Oh, and basic diner decor with an Indiana spin to everything.Prices are good - in line with standard diner pricing.  I've had a variety of breakfasts here...if you consider omelets and scrambled eggs variety...always with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Solid.Go Hoosiers!  What is a hoosier anyway?  As far as I know it is a kitchen cabinet with a small counter area attached.  Go kitchen furniture!I am so glad I finally made it over here to try Hoosier Café.  GREAT breakfasts!  The first time I went by myself and had the half Belgian waffle breakfast.  That was the perfect amount of food.  Then I took my husband back and we loaded up and tried a couple of things.  I had a delicious California omelet with fresh avocado, and the B & G were old school.  Soft, fluffy biscuits and peppery sausage gravy.  That's the way it should be done.  I've seen the same servers both times and they seem like they've worked together a long time.  Like a well-oiled machine they take care of everybody with a smile.  As a side benefit I got a huge kick out of the table of geriatric regulars reading from the newspaper and talking politics.  Our world needs more of that.  One dude was eyeballing me the time I was there alone.  I figured I was either in his usual seat (which is more likely the reason) or he was wondering if I'd be offended by their comments about Hillary Clinton.  Heck no!  Comment away!  It's a free country.  Well, for now anyway.  Unless you have a dissenting  opinion on certain topics, or try to carry a plastic bag around in Bisbee.  Reasonable prices, great service, stimulating conversation, and excellent food!  I may have found my new favorite breakfast spot.

Restaurant name  Four Kegs Sports Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Diner's, Drive In's, and Dives is so hit or miss on their recommendations.  The Four Kegs seems to fit the pattern.  The original stromboli that everyone raves about- didn't impress us that much.  If you live in a major city, you can find a stromboli in your home town just like it and in many cases - better.  We did like the dough, which is a huge part of any stromboli.  It's nice and browned, with a buttery flavor to it.  Other than that we were not impressed with the fillings here.  It was mostly an average quality black forrest ham, although there were supposed to be pepperoni and salami in there as well.  No other flavor really stood out.  Black Forrest ham isn't an italian meat, not sure why they are using it here when you have so many great Italian cold cuts to chose from.  The stromboli also could have had more cheese and marinara sauce.  Only 3 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#aHBeyIiUwWA0g3ATNPnR5gIf you are going to come here make sure you get the Meatball Boli.  Four Kegs meatballs are very tasty.  Surrounded by the excellent golden buttery crust, this one was a winner.  We ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip in and I suggest you do as well.  It's not an amazing sauce, but I found a little dip went a long way.  It could have used a few more meatballs in this boil as well, especially since we were sharing.  4.5 stars for the Meatball Stromboli.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#xhW180LRrXist_kfJBrl-QMy wife rocked the boat and got the Chicken Philly.  I wanted to try the Philly cheese steak since a few people have raved about it on yelp.  But she loves a good a chicken philly, unfortunately this one was just kind of average with green peppers and onions.  Nothing too remarkable about it and it made her wonder why we drove here.  Also the potato salad was very sweet and blah. 3 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#m47QUO5PiUWFKIVpjdKciAMy daughter had some kind of fried mac 'n cheese nuggets.  Yuck!  If I never ate one of those again it would be ok with me.   It was clearly Kraft Mac -n Cheese balled up, breaded and deep fried.  Her fries were very uninspired as well.  Based on what we tried, I found Four Kegs to be a one trick pony with the Meatball Boli.  Perhaps pizza is good here, since they have a good dough and seem to know what to do with it.  I'd say Four Kegs is best for locals only.

Restaurant name  Old Town Tortilla Factory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Food still tastes like doo doo.And the service is still on par with the food.Caveat emptor.Old Town Tortilla Factory's patio and outdoor ambiance is beautifully romantic. On a perfect Arizona evening in the spring or fall, it's an excellent spot to enjoy the comfortable climate. One star awarded. But if you do anything besides sit on the patio, you will be disappointed. Four stars deducted.   Our server took our order after we had been seated for about 10-15 minutes. Then it was like she completely forgot that she had to actually bring us our margaritas and food. Total space cadet. We asked for things, like waters, that never came. Call me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!The food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the "El Tesoro Del Mar" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless. I tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon. As far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it. I've had better margaritas at places with better menus. I can honestly say that after eating here once, I have ZERO desire to ever go back.You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium.Well The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.You would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service. Nope.This would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,Prior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up.Uncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.Service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks.Had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas.Hey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight) Old Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard.Laying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.But you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife.Only I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business.Oh well, who cares...right?There'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow. Are you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance? You both have so much in common.I absolutely loved this place!! So I'm a bit surprised to see the lower rating reviews. I came here for dinner with the lover. We sat outside on the patio which is absolutely adorable. They have a waterfall to set the mood. Lol. I started with the blue agave margarita. This was delicious! It also comes with a shaker!! My entree I ordered the carne de fuego. The steak at their restaurant is just extremely tasteful. It was perfect. Our waitress also informed us that they have custom tortillas that change on a daily basis. The evening we came we tried a red pepper tortilla that also came with a jalepeno butter. Oh my gosh!!! I thought that everything was just absolutely delicious and perfect. From the drinks, to the food, to the excellent customer service, to the cute outdoor patio. The only negative for me was I wish they had a bigger menu.  I'll definitely be back for more!!

Review Text :
Today I had one of my best dining experiences in the Valley, and it was a lunch buffet - and this is what the review is for; the establishment is mainly a full-service restaurant. Of course it helped that I was with delightful company - fellow yelpers Rand, Mike, Robyn, Arlin, and Georgie. It also helped that the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere, very friendly service, and a pleasant contemporary vibe. But it was the food that totally blew me way - it was so good! There were not as many items as you would see in a super buffet, and this restaurant is not trying to be one. But every item that they do serve is cooked to tasty perfection - the succulent slices of beef, the crisp stir-fried vegetables, the crunchy spring rolls and onion rings, the awesome egg flower tofu soup, the best fish fillets I've  ever had ... everything was superb! I'm normally pretty good at portion control when dining out, but that went out the window this time around. It was so worth the long drive from my area in northwest Phoenix. Thanks, Rand, for introducing me to this stellar place!

I've been eating at Fausto's  Mexican grills for 10 year the rainbow location was my introduction to these restaurants and I eat a breakfast burrito every morning at work and after you watch them cook your made to order breakfast burrito for years you get a custom to seeing them prepare your food , So today 12-05 14 at 1:00 pm I go to the collage location which I've been going to since they've opened , I ordered my breakfast burrito and walk over to bag my sauces and wonder why I don't see anyone cooking my lunch , I walk over to the guy that took my order and he hands me a lukewarm breakfast burrito in a bag and says here you go , well I'm stunned and I ask him where this come from I just ordered my food a minute and a half ago nobody made me any fresh eggs so I can wear this come from , and with a stupid smile on his face he says are they just made it and I tell him dude I was getting sauces I just ordered it I get sauces and nobody cooked anything, and with stupid smile on his face I tell him dude it's not even hot are you going to cook a fresh one and he just continued to smile at me like all of a sudden he doesn't speak or understand English I just asked for my money back and he thought it was pretty funny . I'll never go to this location again I'm not putting down all these restaurants but this punk that works at this location on collage needs to learn customer service , Buyer beware at Fausto's grill # 3 . Will never recommend or ever take my family or friends there ever again , due to this clown . I give them one star for past performance.It's really only a "3 now" but we have been coming here for many years. They have raised the prices and the quality has gone down.

Restaurant name  Trailer Park Restaurant

Review Text :
Until recently, the only time I went to Dos Gringos Trailer Park was to partake in the beloved ASU tradition of drinking 50 cent Coronas until I can no longer walk. At which point I begin yelling at random strangers headed to the bar that if they get me this time I'll get them next time. C'mon It's just 50 Cents! Corona Light Please! However, after graduating I regretfully had to get one of those things that tends to severely limit my mid week drinking binges. You know...a job. It's just not as fun to get hammered when you know you're running the risk of being above the legal BAC on the way to work in the morning at 8 am. Oh I've seen it happen! So now I've been more of a happy hour, weekend day drinking Dos Gringos customer and let me tell you it's much more enjoyable to drink beers (even if they do cost more than a dollar) in an actual chair...a barstool even. It's also nice to not have to watch where you walk all the time as to avoid the puddles of vomit on the ground. And you don't have to worry about those annoying drunk girls who scream at you to "get" them this time cuz the coronas are only 50 cents! I mean, geez, I'm not made of quarters over here!As far as drink and food specials go, Dos Gringos is pretty solid and I'm surprised they're not busier for Friday Happy Hours. It's impossible to sit down at most bars in the area at that time, but there's always a few barstools and tables open over there. Last time my boyfriend and I wandered in at about 6:50, planning to get a couple happy hour drinks but were fine (obviously) with paying full price for the rest. Our awesome bartender basically saved us 10 bucks by throwing 6 beers in a bucket of ice for us, all 6 at the $2 price, and then making sure she came around quickly enough for us to put in some tacos before they went up to full price as well. We got 6 beers and 8 tacos for less than 20 bucks. It was glorious. I'd recommend going for the cheap drinks and the great patio, just stay away from Thursday nights if you don't want vomit on your shoes.I cannot believe I am giving Dos Gringos 5 Stars, but you better believe I am. Why, you ask, is this Cenpho junkie giving an EXTREMELY Tempe bar five stars? 1. The one and only fight I have ever been in took place here. (yes, I won) 2. I got trashed the other night for $5. 3. You are inside and outside at exactly the same time. 4. They have ample bathroom stalls in the women's restroom. 5. There are bowls of limes on the counters. I hate asking for lime. 6. I get hit on at least three times before I finish my first drink. 7. They have live music. 8. You can get molested in public without being arrested 9. I always get carded.I came here because I was in desperate need of an alcoholic beverage. I was actually trying to find 4 peaks, and ran into this place instead.  I pulled up and noticed that its not like the other places out there.  Colorful, eclectic, with an island kind of feel.  Very open and airy.  There seemed to be a college kid aurora, but I did notice a few adults there drinking as well.Place is colorfully decorated, with great drink prices.  I guess they serve food too, but I didnt eat here.  Great alternative to your typical place.

Restaurant name  Uncle Sal's Italian Restaurant

Review Text :
I have such conflict leaving a 1 star review for Uncle Sal's. Why? Because I LOVE Uncle Sal's food. I have been eating here off and on for years and live close by. Make no mistake; it's some of the tastiest Italian fare around--I have never had a bad meal. The problem? A cockroach infestation. Yes--infestation. One need only keep ones eyes open. In June, I went to eat for my birthday. As we were sitting awaiting our meal, a small cockroach scurried across our table. Ok--one measly roach--I can handle that as an anomaly. But when I went back again in about 4 weeks with a friend for lunch, we waited in a back booth (for 20 minutes I might add) for someone to take our order (that's a whole other story--seems the lunch wait staff becomes somewhat frazzled when they get a rush--an acknowledgement, or a simple "haven't forgotten about you, will be right there" would have sufficed)--we sat waiting and as we both looked at the brick wall over the heads of a table of some gentlemen having a biz lunch, we both noticed 2-3 little roaches darting in and out of the cracks of the wall. My friend and I simultaneously said: "are you seeing what I am seeing?" And agreed in unison to leave. As we passed our apparition of a wait person on our way out, I informed this person that we were leaving and why. She simply looked at me with very little expression and said (I kid you not) "oh, I know we have roaches, they are just active because we sprayed recently". I informed her that one scurried across my table a month ago as well. She just shrugged. Sigh. Sorry to do this to you Uncle Sal's, but until you can have someone get in there and bomb the place, And claim you are roach free, I simply have no interest in sharing my meal with an army of 6 legged buggies. I can only imagine how many of them could be lurking in the kitchen and I am no wuss. Beware. Sad state of affairs. I miss you, Uncle Sal's, but not that much.

Review Text :
Calamari, overcooked. 2 orders of veal, overcooked. Drunk guy walking around the entire meal screaming? priceless.When we arrived, we ordered a beer each and some calamari to hold us over until the Cal game started. The gal behind the bar was somewhat "rude" to begin with (maybe she had a bad day?). We then ordered salad and pasta for dinner with wine. She was "perturbed" that we were planning to share the order rather than order an entree each. The game finally started and fans for both teams were rooting/screaming as usual and the owner came over to me and told me I was "too loud"---even though everyone else was cheering all the same. We even bought a beer for the guy sitting next to us (who was betting on Louisville). She wrote up our bill even though we weren't finished with the meal (nor possible ordering of dessert, etc.) and told us to leave.When we asked her why she said we had been there long enough. (???) She even threatened to black out all of the TV's (there were about half a dozen). We were absolutely dumbfounded. This is the kicker: we have frequented The Grotto for the past 4 years during spring training, tip well, and considered ourselves "regulars" (we became acquainted with everyone that worked there including the owner) but this gal behind the bar was new to us. Who knows the real reason--we are still scratching our heads! However, we will no longer patronize such rude service.  As 4 year patrons, we are no longer supporting their establishment.  We've been discovering how Scottsdale has been booming with new eateries----from excellent sports bars with great food, service , wine menu and draft beer selections to nice linen tablecloth dining experiences.  We certainly don't need to be insulted by those at The ?Grotto anymore.Made a reservation for 730 on a Saturday night (a busy time...obviously). Showed up at 725 to find a long line full of other kind folks in small parties (2-3 people) who had made reservations and were waiting to be seated while other groups of folks walked up and got seated immediately.......needless to say we left (so, no I didn't try the food...I'm sure it's great but I don't take my business to places that treat customer's this way). Working in the industry has soured me on places like this. Customer service is the ultimate....if you take reservations you should keep them and be fair with your seating priorities.DO NOT GO HERE....unless you enjoy spending 200 dollars in under an hour and geting told to leave by  the crack head alcoholic owner. After spending less than an hour and still with wine in our glasses - he walked up and  pulled the table back away from us and said to leave because he had a "wait". I had been there several times and used to reccomend this place but NO way now. I told him that I would no longer support his restaurant with horrible service like that and his response was (in front of my guests and other tables around):"You think I care? Look at my wait, get the hell out. Go get laid and quit busting my balls."I hope people don't support service like that because there are a ton of other restaurants in Scottsdale with better service and better food.....We too never got an opportunity to eat here.  After waiting at the door behind a party of 4 for about 5 minutes with no host or hostess I asked the party in front of us how long the wait was.  They said they did not know but had been waiting there for 10 mintues waiting to be greeted.  I decided to walk into the restaurant and look for some help.  I spotted a server and smiled and asked what the wait time was explaining that no one was there to greet us.  He looked as though he was going to help and started walking towards me and then past me and said they were busy.  No sorry someone will be right with you we are a little busy.  Just a rude curt get out of my way kind of attitude.  I walked right back to our party of four and said this place is rude let's get out of here.  We went to Bucca Di Beppo across the way and were greeted with big smiles and open arms.  The staff was amazing!  Shaken by my experience with the rude waiter I asked our waiter at Bucca to provide me with a duplicate receipt of our dinner bill.  I took the receipt back to Italian Grotto and wanted to speak to a manager explaining how they lost the business due to a rude waiter.  Well I never showed the receipt because again there was no host in the lobby so I proceed to walk into the restuarant to find the manager.  I was stopped by a halfbaked and drunk man with an empty bottle of wine in his hand in a gray shirt with gray hair and two diamond earrings in his ear.  He approached me and said you looking for someone.  I replied yes the owner or manager please.  He stood there and acted as though he were the person.  I asked are you the owner?  He said why are you asking me questions? I never asked you questions?  I turned to my friend and said they cannot be the owner.  I again asked and got the same response.  He ordered us out of the dining room and told us to talk to him on the tile area considered their tiny lobby.  I walked back and he was beligerent and drunk and proceeded to tell me that I was the rudest person he ever met.  Complete whackjob!  I agree that friends have to be writing these positive reviews.  Dick's Last Resort known to be rude on purpose posed as angels to this place.Not only did our inattentive waiter bring my fiancé the totally wrong meal from what we ordered, he tried to argue with us that it was what we asked for, and then tried to charge us for it! They took away his untouched dinner and when we asked why it couldn't be replaced with what we ordered or if it could be deducted from the bill, the waiter exclaimed, "Well who do you expect to pay for this?!" We were so taken aback by his rudeness and unprofessionalism that we were left speechless. When we asked to speak with the manager, he advised we "take it off his tip." The server's tip didn't cover the cost of the meal we never received nor ate! Finally after waiting around a half hour the server deducted $20 off our bill.  We go out to eat easily 5-6 times a week, and never in my life have I been so disrespected and treated so poorly by a restaurant staff.  To top it off, as we were leaving, the manager yelled out the door, "He took your meal off the bill and you still stiff him on the tip?! Don't come back here again." I cried back, "We paid for a meal we never got!"  I am still left in utter amazement that an establishment like this exists in which customers are treated in such a demeaning and ungracious manner.  I am disgusted by the experience and can only hope that this establishment suffers greatly for their offenses.If I could give zero stars I would. Worst host service I've ever experienced. Not even very busy but the idiot at the door couldn't tell us how long the wait was. Seemed to be drunk or high. Asked several times but I don't think he could add or tell time. Never got an answer. I'd suggest you cross the street to Bucca.Made a reservation but they did not honor it. Employees kept dismissing me when I would try to talk to them. One of there employees very rudely told me to stand back when I was simply trying to ask about my reservation. If the food is good, I wouldn't know but the service was absolutely lousy.Can I give negative stars? My boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said "here's your check please pay and leave." I said "Excuse me" and he responded "You are a waste of space at my bar." I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded "are you serious?" All he said was "Leave" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, "Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway." As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said "I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me.Went back to Grotto for the first time in many years.  I was a fan then, I still am.The restaurant is loud.  It's crowded.  And the food is good.  We started with mussels portifino (a white wine and garlic broth).  I liked that the dish was available in two sizes, the small being perfect for an app for two.  A little more bread to soak up the broth would have been nice, though.I also had a special of sea bass over ravioli topped with marinara.  I liked all the components except I never seem to learn I'm not so big on seafood with marinara.  The sea bass was a generous portion, and cooked perfectly, as was the ravioli.  I had a little bit of plate envy over my husband's halibut with a lemon butter sauce.  I had this dish the last time and loved it!Service was average.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but not really friendly.  He oddly never made eye contact (not sure if he was always looking at something/someone else or just weird) and he rattled off the specials way too quickly.   Certainly not bad enough to deter me from going again.  But someone remind me not to order seafood in red sauce!I sent my family tonight for dinner. They had a reservation for 7pm. At 7:30when my brother asked about the table the VERY rude owner Charlie told them toleave? HORRIBLE. Who does that to a party of 8 with 3 young children afterwaiting 45 minutes? Terrible customer service. UNBELIEVABLE. Do notgo to this restaurant!I hadn't been there in about 3 years. The food was delicious. But the waiter RAISED THE PRICE ON ME,,,IT WAS A PRICE which was not the price on the menu!!  I saw a menu for lunch, but then the waiter raised the price by $5.00 dollars MORE for my entree and an extra dollar for my iced tea! I didn't really think about it until I got outside, thinking that the lunch I had bought was a bit too expensive, while rechecking the lunch menu posted outside. I had already paid for my meal and left. He had definately raised the price on my lunch meal by $5.00!!! There seems to be somekind of SCAM going on over there. Maybe the owner wasn't around...This place is horrible. I wish I could tell you the chicken is rubber. I wish I could explain how rude the waiter was when he spilled scalding soup on my friends lap. The reason I can't tell you any of this is because my friends and I never got in. We arrived slightly early and spotted a parking spot right in front. Boom parking karma (Screeching brakes) until we can't fully pull in to the spot because of a drunken tweaker straddling the sidewalk. Should have tipped us off to how the evening was going to unfold. After sending ahead our low man on the totem pole we are told there will be a wait. Hey no problemo. It's 7:55 and we've got an 8:00 reservation. As we hang outside it becomes glaringly obvious this joint has no intentions of seating any of the folks who are waiting WITH RESERVATIONS. As we wait one of our group says he was tipped off to this place listening to a local San Francisco sports show. Lo and behold there is said morning show host Murphy(must be tough being named after a wedgie) blocking the front entrance and generally acting like a douche. Eventually we reached the breaking point and left when the host informed us that it would be a 90 minute wait from our reservation time. HA. The positive to the whole experience was the CD we bought off some dude outside while we waited. It had some awesome beats and the legendary track 7 titled "Who the F**k are you?" came in handy when we circled the block and bumped the radio to 11 while letting Murph know he is a tool. Hey maybe next year I'll actually get inside to try some food.The inebriated owner commanded us, mere pawns in his game of drunk restaurant chess, to a table in the back with his index finger, very much resembling in manner an old nonchalant cavalry brigadier. That same finger told us, dummies, to wait for minutes next to the table while it got cleaned. But it was a different finger that kicked us out of the restaurant for asking the owner - who happened to also be our waiter - to repeat something he mentioned from his improvised lunch menu. This was the middle finger, which he flipped at us along with a healthy dose of swearing and insults in his determination to make sure that we would never again return to his glorious establishment for our terrible misconduct. But that particular finger came out only after our table was swept away from us in a fury of hate and madness as innocent bystanders watched in horror. We exited the restaurant in silence and humiliation for our contemptible actions. Never again would we stand up for our right to repeat what a waiter says - lesson learned! And never would we receive the honor of trying one of the Grotto's legendary food offerings. Confused? Then my review has served its purpose. My feeling of confusion lingered on that day, and only after my thought process finally cleared a bit did I start to comprehend the fact that this was undeniably the most repulsive restaurant experience of my life. Thanks to the Grotto, my standards for restaurant service have sank to the bottom of Mariana's Trench! In retrospect, since this episode, I am actually really enjoying visits to very average restaurants. My ultimate recommendation to fellow Yelpers: when your standards for restaurant service become impossible to satisfy and you see yourself handing out a bunch of 3 star reviews, do yourself a favor and pay the Italian Grotto a visit!Came here to celebrate a special event. Decided on Grotto because of the reviews but couldn't be disappointed more. Rude and disrespectful owner/server who was very judgmental. We ended up leaving due to his demeanor and treatment. Want a similar experience? Make reservations and enter at  your own risk.As soon as we walked in, the greasy haired "Guy" walked up to me and said, "You look young...." I'm thinking, "Was I just insulted?". So I asked my daughter and she said, "Geez! I think so?" The night went DOWNHILL from there. I was publicly chastised for listening to a message on my cell - from my deployed Son, by the way, and the wine menu was yanked from my hand and I was ordered to have the big red wine that I didn't want and didn't enjoy. So I ordered my own bottle and ended up paying for both. Be warned - the wine list is very, very thin. This guy gives Snottsdale a BAD name. After spending a couple of hundreds, I left angry, humiliated and almost forgot what I ate because I hated this Maniac so much for almost ruining a well deserved night out with my family. The food? Pretty good for way overpriced Italian. Too bad there is such a big DISCONNECT between the front of the house and the kitchen. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of some of the better Italian food found in the area. I'll spend my discretionary income where it is appreciated and hope to God that someone gets rid of that JERK. NO GO GROTTO says it all. Thanks for reading! In All Sincerity, FoodBloggerIf I could, I would give this place zero stars! The food was not bad but if you like to be treated rudely and enjoy crappy service then this is a place for you! Right when we were seated my husband wanted to get up and leave but we were in a large group so out of respect for everyone else who was hungry in our group we stayed.Good food. Worst dining experience ever. The waiter was extremely rude. Will never go here again.The worst customer experience ever!!! For such a small place, you would think they'd care about keeping patrons happy. But our waiter was rude and impersonal and the owner approached the table and was even worse!! Would not recommend. Spend your $$$$ elsewhere.Let me start by saying, I work in television. Specifically, I work on television shows that rip managers like the one here new assholes in front of millions of people. Say what you want about Kitchen Nightmares, Bar Rescue and Kitchen Impossible, but we take people like the manager that works here and kick them to the curb where lowlifes like her belong. The only thing I can say is I WISH we were shooting this bar so I could give this bitch what she deserves. The following is a detailed encounter with the WORST MANAGER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER. Skip to the second to last paragraph if you just want the punchline. I'll understand. I'll set the scene for you: It's a Thursday night, my crew and I are on location working on said television show in Scottsdale. My boyfriend is from New York and we were looking to catch the Knicks game. Alas, we were pointed to "the best Italian joint in Arizona" by a neighboring bar owner. We walk on over and set up shop in a lovely little bar, we chat it up with the Bartender, TR, he's great, welcoming, from jersey, he even shares tales of the owner's history in New York. Everything is going swimmingly, what a great night out with friends, right? We order a few appetizers  bucket of clams, bucket of mussels and 3 light beers. All delicious. Atmosphere is beautiful, great old school music, just a great New Yorker's bar. One of our guys is an HUGE Ucla fan so of course, he brought his Ipad with him so he could stream the UCLA game. This is where shit begins to quickly go south. My friend asks the TR if he could use the wireless to stream a little better. TR kindly directs us to a heavy set, dark haired woman bundled up like she's never been in weather below 80 degrees before. My friend kindly approaches her and asks if she's the manager. Her reply: "I don't work here".... hmmm My friend and I are perplexed... Well that strange because  TR just said you were the manager. My friend, confused, turned to TR assuming he must have asked the wrong woman. Nope, that was her and she just told us she didn't work here. Annoyed but polite, my friend leans over to her to get her attention and confront her about saying she didn't work here. He's joking with her at first, with a smile on his face. Her quip back to my friend, no lie this is what she said, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?". My friend is taken back by her aggressive nature and explains all he was going to ask was if he could use the internet. She aggressively tells him she doesn't know the password and walks to the end of the bar, yells over customers to TR (the nicest bartender on the planet) not to direct customers to her and if they want internet "THEY CAN PAY FOR 4G"**Personal Note: Bitch, we have 4G.We kept our mouths shut until we finished our drinks and food. Contemplated staying because the locals at the bar acknowledged the manager is known for being a bitch. TR was so great and welcoming and apologized for her behavior. Sadly, despite TR's attempt, we had to leave out of purpose alone. We close our tab, take care of TR because he's awesome and make our way to the door. Before making our way completely out the door, my friend leans over to the manager and QUIETLY lets her know A) She's a terrible manager and B) we're leaving because of her. That's when she literally went Cat. 5-Batshit-Crazy on us. Screaming at my friend in front of the ENTIRE Restaurant, "DON'T POINT YOUR FINGER AT ME!!!" "IF YOU WEREN'T SO CHEAP TO PAY FOR 4G YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM" We let her know politely we're leaving and she's acting crazy to her reply, "LEAVE MOTHER FUCKERS!" Yep. She called us mother fuckers for asking if we could use the internet. "DON'T FUCKING COME BACK HERE YOU CHEAP ASSHOLES." Yep. That was another one that really stood out. It's a shame. We roll with a crew of 60 people and every city we're in, we take over a local bar and restaurant for the 3 weeks we're in town. We understand the hospitality industry and we applaud great work and most of the time overlook bad behavior. I can honestly say I've never experienced such shocking behavior from anyone in the industry ever. I'm still completely blown away by how incredibly aggressive this woman was and how such a great place can employ such toxic behavior. I can say, despite TR's attempt to get us to come back, myself, nor anyone from our crew will bring business here while we're in town. With Love, KOne of the worst experiences I've ever had in Scottsdale.  These folks need to head back to NYC and take their terrible food, service and bad attitude with them.   I cannot believe all the good reviews here.   There were eight of us so they automatically add the tip and boy did we pay for it.   The terrible waiter who admitted he was from buffalo complained about us right to our face and the odd thing is we didn't do anything at all.  Owner came over at the end of he night and told me that you don't have to like everybody as he doesn't like his ex wives (?) and they didn't need our business as they're always packed. He also suggested I write a terrible review so I thought I should.  Food is expensive and below average. Definitely not worth it.After a few months in India, I came back to good ol' Scottsdale to enjoy some western food. Decided to walk into Italian Grotto given the positive reviews.  Huge Mistake!Someone must be pumping up the stats of this place because my experience was absolutely awful. The owner appeared to be drunk and  harassing other patrons; thankfully not us!  The waitstaff was extremely rude and standoff-ish.  Our server gave us one minute to decide after he gave us the menus and then started being condescending because we were still reading through the choices.  Maybe he had somewhere more important to be? The salads came warm, the pasta came cold, and the water/napkins were never reloaded. There are several good Italian options in Scottsdale and this one's not worth another look. I don't post many reviews, but I would be doing a huge disservice to the Yelp community if I let this experience pass. This place must stay open because of its location because it has nothing else going for it. I wouldn't give this place another hard earned dime!Pros -- LocationCons -- Ugh, where do I start? Everything else.This place is a pit! My first and last time ever eating at this place! Our server seems like he just hates his job and hates dealing with people ... The owner who was definitely drunk didn't listen to the problem I was having with my meal before blowing up... So here's what happened we walked in and it took 5 mins before anyone came to seat us, no biggie . The server comes up no apology or anything,but again no biggie . We are seated next to the kitchen door even though there are multiple tables available. I'm hungry so I don't say anything but at this point I'm feeling like this guy has something personal against me haha. He hands us our menus and walks away. No drink orders or anything! So I call him back and ask him to take our drink orders and he still has no apology... Who trained this guy? So he comes back to take our orders and I ordered the red snapper and my girlfriend orders a plate of spaghetti. The food arrives and to be honest it smelled good and I was excited to chow down... I took a bite and the taste was just off... I tried to eat it any way because I really didn't feel like dealing with the server again. But after maybe 5 bites I couldn't take anymore... I called over the server and told him that I think the fish may be old and that it has a bad taste he just looked at me like I was an idiot... And I  guess the owner heard me because he rushed to the table basically yelling that his fish is fresh and that the fish I was eating was just shipped that morning... I waited for him to finish and asked for my money back and told him we would take our business elsewhere. His face got red like I asked if I could kiss his wife or something...  He yells a bit louder now that the fish was half eaten and that we would have to pay for it... By this time the whole room is staring at us. I threw down some cash on the table and my girlfriend and I walked out.... This was by far the weirdest, worst restaurant experience of my life... These guys need to be shut down or need a change of ownership... You can't treat people the way they do and just get away with it because they are a " New York" style restaurant ... I've been to New York and the cabbies have more class than this man... Their 3 1/2 star rating is a joke!!Just left the place, at home now waiting for a pizza as we left this place in disgust! Not only are we disgusted at the NASTY BUG! (see the last picture) in my friends salad but also at the attitude server Henry gave us as we pointed this out to him. He insisted in a rude manner that this was an anchovie. I'm pretty sure anchovies don't have legs and wings and look like a freaking BUG. I know he didn't want to make a scene for the parties around us, so he tried to make us look stupid. Well sorry Henry, the only stupid one here is you, especially for telling us to "just leave" after you failed to accept this mistake. That's the worst thing you can do to your costumers who have frequented this place. HORRID!we figure this place stays busy and open because of its amazing location. that's all it has going for it.Horrible horrible horrible.....Is that the soup nazi I see in the kitchen....no its the owner...OMG stay far far away.....If you look at my two other Yelp reviews, you will see positive reviews of a couple of restaurants I've been to. Normally, if a restaurant is lame, which is rare, I won't even review it. But I am going to enjoy eviscerating this truly repulsive restaurant, not for the food, which was somewhat edible, but for the dishonest pricing and for the jerk who apparently owns the place.My girlfriend Carol and I were walking through Scottsdale. It was just past noon on a recent Sunday so we were thinking about lunch. We passed Italian Grotto and saw a menu posted outside on the wall. The "lunch" part of the menu had most entrees at $8. "I'll treat you to lunch," she said. "Sounds good," said I.We went in and there were very few customers. Three or four people were sitting at the bar. We were seated quickly. The server, who was polite, brought us menus. The first thing we noticed was that there were no $8 items on it. All of the lunch items were priced at $13 or more. So we asked the server about the menu on the outside of the building. Here's what he said: "Yes, those are $8 items if you get them al la carte." Of course, al la carte suggests that you can get, say, the baked ravioli for $8 if you get nothing else on the side. But then the server added "But these items do come with either soup or salad." Hmmm? It clearly sounded like he was saying the lunch special was $8 and you still got a soup or salad. Carol and I looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. I ordered the baked ravioli, she ordered a vegetable pasta dish.(Each of these were $8 on the outside menu but $13 on the menu he handed us. He clearly intimated that we were ordering items as a "lunch special".) We also ordered  a side of garlic bread and one iced tea. That's all we ordered.As we awaited our meals, there was some person standing around the lobby and I heard him say something loudly about "Jews", which got my attention. He seemed drunk and a couple of the servers were standing around him so I thought "some idiot"...and tuned him out. (And remember, this was just after noon!)The food arrived and was fine. I got exactly four medium-sized ravioli on my plate, along with a salad. The drunk guy was quiet but still standing around the lobby like he owned the place. He looked a bit like Donald Trump, same age and attitude, and he wore a couple of rather large gold earrings in his left ear.After we ate, we got the check and were shocked to see that it totaled $40. Not only that, but the entrees were written down as $14 each. What kind of weird mistake was this? Carol, who doesn't mind confronting issues like this, had me wait at the table while she went to find the waiter.Then I heard the loud guy yapping at her. I did not hear what he was saying but it sounded, at a distance, like he was arguing with her. As my attention turned to him, my girlfriend laughed a couple of times and I thought that this guy must be the manager or owner. (Carol is from Long Island and is used to New York attitudes so I figured all was good.) This one-sided conversation lasted 5 minutes or so. Then she came back with the bill and rolled her eyes saying "Let's get outta here."As it turned out, the owner only deducted that extra two dollars from the bill (from $14 to $13 per entree) and, according to Carol, he reeked of alcohol and acted drunk. And obnoxious. He asked her to "Get a load of the queers at the bar!" And that was just the beginning of his tirade.She said that the owner wondered why I, the boyfriend, wasn't paying the bill and that "no woman should pay when a man can pay. I have six daughters and if they ever had to pay for a meal on a date, the boyfriends would never be welcome in the house!" Carol, thinking that the guy was just trying to act like a macho New Yorker, told him that she was from Long Island. In response he said "Long Island isn't New York! Only spoiled brats live on Long Island. I grew up in Manhattan, in Chelsea, on 29th and 9th!" He asked Carol why we were in Scottsdale. She said, "We live in Tucson and have been visiting Arcosanti." He said "Why would you live in Tucson? It's a dump! I had a bagel business on 1st Ave. in Tucson and it was a terrible place!" He also added, "I was at Arcosanti a few years ago and it was dirty and hippies lived there." I suppose this was the point in the conversation when Carol laughed and walked away.As we were walking back to our car and Carol was relating this story, we knew that this information needs to get out. And seeing what many others have written about this restaurant, I think you can see we aren't exaggerating. The owner of Italian Grotto is some drunken misanthrope named Gary Horowitz (so why his comment about Jews?!) and no one should be supporting his business.also see: http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2001-05-03/restaurants/veni-vici-vendetta/full/The owner of this restaurant is the rudest person I have ever encountered. He reacted aggressively toward us at a simple request to keep some food warm. We were all perfectly civil, reasonable customers and were treated MOST disrespectfully. The police were even involved when we wanted to leave in the middle of our meal. He succeeded in ruining our night and obtaining a large sum for food we did not eat because we were so offended by his behavior. I do not often wish I'll will upon another person. But this man is despicable and I hope you will not support this business. **the waiter Will was lovely, howeverLast night 6 of my girlfriends and I had dinner here. We had made reservations and were seated promptly. We were however seated next to the door and one of my girlfriends was shoved a few times by other customers because of it. We all shrugged it off and tried to enjoy our night.First off the 2 stars are for the food. The food was pretty amazing. I had the Chilean sea bass and it was divine. It was served on top of freshly made ravioli and it was incredible. Everyone else had very positive things to say about their dinner. For dessert we all shared 3 cannolis which tasted heavenly. So delicious.Here is where it takes a turn for the worse...Our bill arrived and we know that they don't do separate checks. Understandable. We were told we could split it up with our cards as long as we told them how much to charge. Fast forward 2 minutes...as I'm simply writing down how much to charge on each card, a older looking balding man approaches our table and starts mumbling about needing our table and that we have been taking too long. Are you kidding me? From start to end we were there a MAXIMUM of 1 hour, a party of 7 mind you! He then proceeds to come back and again states that we are taking forever with the cards and what is it going to take to get us out of there. I understand that it's a Saturday night, but the manner in which he addressed us was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. It was flat out rude and demeaning. At first I thought maybe he was just having a bad night and whatnot but after reading other reviews I know that is just his "wonderful" personality. I would love to come back for the food but am not going to support a business that is spearheaded by such a jerk.On the disappointment scale, Italian Grotto ranks right up there with my never getting laid by my first girlfriend, whom I now know twenty years later is a lesbian.Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara. The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat.The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown.This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it? I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving.I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes.Another huge disappointment.It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce.I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off. I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally!I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at $12.95.The only thing good about this place was nothing. I suspect they've remained in business all these years primarily due to their location, and all the unknowing tourists.Never going back.My husband and I had a nice dinner outside however when I went to use the bathroom the owner stopped me  and told me I had  90 seconds to use the bathroom. He had two girls bang in the door. I told him he owed me a apology and he called me a nasty name. He was very rude and I would never go back. I would have called the police but I was visiting my very ill brother. Please don't go here. He should be shut down. We spent 60 dollars and this is how he treats his customers. I hope this post stops people from eating there and he shuts down.This place made my stomach flip! The owner was rude and assumed that we did not speak English because our skin was brown. I have never felt more offended in my life.  And then he acted like he was giving us complimentary glasses of wine and appetizers to redeem himself as a "New Yorker" and charges us    The place is way overpriced and nothing special.  Move on now !!!! We had an app and a glass of overpriced wine and decided to leave because of the offensiveness.   Disgusted by what an owner representsInsulting, dishonest and bottom line an absolute joke! We made reservations over a month ago, arrived and waited over 40 minutes but that wasn't the problem, the problem was the inebriated owner!  He continued to seat people without reservations and when we graciously asked about how much longer it would be he made a huge scene. He offered to buy us drinks, started yelling and the restaurant got to witness his unruly/unprofessional behavior.  He yelled that since "your always on your phone all day so why don't you write a review, I won't care I'll be busy anyway", well Mr.  I'm a writing a review and I hope your restaurant is empty forever more!We had a mediocre dinner tonight. I have been here before but after tonight, we won't be returning. The salad was just OK. Lettuce with a ton of blue cheese dressing that tasted like sour cream. The entree of halibut was good. The waiter apparently didn't like the tip our host gave him. He came back and asked if the service was OK. Then whispered something rude in our host's ear. As we were exiting the table made a big deal of saying "You can't believe this table" to one of his coworkers. Then followed my 84 year old Mom and I and told us he only got a 10% tip. Tips are DISCRETIONARY for one thing and we had no control over that. Classless! If you want real Italian food served by polite people in a relaxed atmosphere, go to Tommy V's and forget this place.******ATROCIOUS, DISRESPECTFUL, INSANE, MENTALLY UNSTABLE AND HIGH ON WEED FATHER SON DUO.....STAY AWAY***** First off, the owner let in people who came way after my family and me. The only reason was because he seemed to be more friendly with them than his other customers. We ordered and the service was OK as to what happened afterwards. My daughters "vegetarian" soup had pork in it which we don't eat. We told the owner and were expecting a nice apology. NO. What we got was WAY worse. He started lecturing us about how no ones perfect! I didn't come here to get a lesson! I came here for a peaceful friendly dinner for my father in law's birthday. I have to make this short (it's too long to write) at the end his demon son ended up kicking us out even though we were already leaving!! He tried to make it seem like we were being kicked out! Unbelievable DONT GO HERE!!! THE OWNER YELLS EVEN AT CHILDREN!I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but if you are ever planning on being within a 100 mile radius of this place, I would recommend that you read it. It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a "vegetarian" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. "Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!" All I wanted was a simple "S-O-R-R-Y." Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed "Excuse me!" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. "Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say "I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? " I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked "Is everyone leaving here?" We said yes and continued to leave. "I don't like being insulted like that," my father told him. "Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! "You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!" Now, my father was mad. "I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with "A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. "Just don't end up in the ER!" my father said. I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I seriously hope this place burns down. It would make the world a much better place.The food is terrible and the service is even worse. Never have I been treated so badly by an owner of a restaurant. He treats his staff just as poorly. He should be ashamed and embarrassed. Such a low life that he went through the garbage for used cigarettes to smoke.This place honestly doesn't understand the concept of service. After being ignored and disrespected by our server we got up to leave, upon seeing the owner on leaving wanted to let him know about WHAT A HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE HE HAS, he continued to tell us we were NOT respected, too young to have an opinion (mind you my friend speaking is 29). Nice try bro, we have corporate credit cards, you messed up with your age profiling. missed out on an unlimited budget *tisk *tisk doucheI have been having an internal debate for a few weeks now about how detailed of a review I wanted to write. I have decided that although I am not excited about wasting more of my time on this horrible establishment, but if I can keep them from making money off of at least one unsuspecting patron, I have succeeded. I will keep it relatively brief because my experience was not much different than most of the other one star experiences complete with rudeness and threats.We were hanging out in Old Town one evening after spring training and decided to stop in. We walked up to the host stand and a line quickly started forming behind us. As my friend and I were wondering where the host was, the gentleman behind us (from another party) informed us that they never have a host and we should beware because when someone does show up, they will be very rude. Weird, we though. I asked his why he still came and he told me, "for the food." "Well whatever" we thought. We shall see for ourselves. He was right about the rude part. We never made it to the food part and I don't care because my hard earned dollars won't go to support such an awful family (it is apparently a family owned business).The owner eventually stumbles up with his glass of wine. My friend says "excuse me, we have a party of 3," to which he replies smugly, "yeah I see that..." Shortly thereafter, a server walks by and as we try to get his attention, he purposely ignores us.Um ok.Next, a server comes up to use the credit card machine. My friend says, "excuse me but we have not been helped yet, is there a host?" To which he replies, "look, if you were sitting in my section, I would help you out, but you aren't, you are here. So you aren't my problem." Charming.Rinse and repeat with a third prince charming who says, "whaddya want me to do, it's busy, etc. etc. [insert a few more obnoxious comments here]"So now that my friend has been treated disrespectfully 3 times, I'm pretty irate and grace our resident jerk with a few choice words of my own. (hey, I'm not proud of it but well.....he deserved it). He looked shocked at a lady standing up for herself and wouldn't you know the big man threatens to call the police. I asked him to please do so (loudly and with an obscenity), but he declined. At first I thought that this was rudeness combined with an utter lack of respect for women. I do think that is true, but it goes further, as it does not seem that they have respect for any of their customers. However, if you can read all of these reviews of behavior that would be unbelievable if it weren't for the sheer QUANTITY of similar reviews, and still donate your cash, I would not respect you either.I wish it was possible to give this place negative stars. Please avoid it at all costs and save your hard earned money and go to a decent restaurant. This place was filthy, food was below mediocre and overpriced, and worst of all, disrespectful owner with too much of an attitude. How can you get away with charging 21 dollars for a chicken caesar salad that seemed to be made with leftover chicken scraps, bagged lettuce, no croutons, and of the size of a side salad? I am a seasoned cook and foodie and eat out often, and by no means this is acceptable anywhere. Even when I used to live in NYC they would never get away with charging that, and if so, it would be in a top notch restaurant in the city. The worst part was when my boyfriend's mom nicely requested a tad more cheese for her pasta and the owner almost dumped the whole cheese bowl in her plate! By no means should customers by treated in this manner. He was even eavesdropping our conversation and gave his input in regards to the subject. What kind of person in his/her right mind does this? In all, you are warned! Please don't come to this establishment.

Review Text :
Likely the best wine bar in old-town. This place has a stellar reputation with locals. My one and only gripe is how busy it is - which makes finding a seat rather difficult.Nice and dark with a wine list that will blow your socks off, and potentially your hard earned dollars too...The crowd is well mixed, slightly older and more sophisticated. A great place to meet up with friends and chill.So I try to impress my girlfriend and tell her that I know of the cool wine bar in Old Town.  I write down the addy since it's been a year or so since I've been here, and then guess what? I loose the paper, oops. We end up walking around for a while and then finally finding it. ---For the few people who haven't been here yet, there is no street front door, and there is only a small sign over the backdoor that says "The truth is inside".---Service is great.  Tried the Egyptian flat bread with morels, brie, shallots and truffle oil. Hell ya.  Now the wine, I'll be the first to admit I'm a winetard, but I'm learning. So at this stage of the game I like the wine flights. 3 3oz samples of a similar wines.  That makes it a bit easier to figure out what the next glass would be.Once you find this place it's great. I found it several years ago, I just forgot where it was.Every Thursday night there's a live jazz ensemble. The singer, after paying a cover charge to hear him sing, will try to seduce your lady. The waitress will remember you every time from the one night you spent with her friend that blew you off because of her bf. Remember that night at BS West? But it's dark so you don't recognize her. And you'll ask if they have a full bar because it's dark and you can't see, but they do... And you'll wander into the cave in the back corner but it's reserved for a private party. Maybe you're a part of it. And the same friend will ask you to buy her a drink, like she does everywhere you see her. And you'll feel used and remind yourself to avoid her.I thought I would update my previous vague review.  I've been a few times now, a couple times with friends and once on a date. It's always been a great time.  Reasons this place will make you happy:-It's dark, so you will probably look better than you normally do. You know low lighting is flattering, don't deny it. It's also highly romantic.-Free shot on your birthday. I took my best friend here on her birthday and the bartender made her a beautiful complimentary shot with a sugared lime on top.  -Wine flights. Do it. You will not be disappointed. I recently partook in a wine flight and one of the offerings tasted exactly like cheese. No joke, every sip of the wine tasted like I was nibbling on cheese. That may sound bad to some of you, but I enjoyed it.  -The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They always steer me towards great wine. Unfortunately, I never remember what that great wine was the next day.-The cheese plates are amazing. Mmmmm, sharp cheddar.The only things not to love are the lines that tend to form for the bathroom, the numerous reserved tables, and the hole that is burned into my wallet.Based on the recommendations from a few local Yelpers, I decided to stop by this joint to have a few drinks.  The entrance to this bar/lounge is in the rear of the building....that was hilarious because I walked by at least 2 or 3 times hearing music and trying to figure out how the hell to get in, until I saw the sign that read "Like All Good Speakeasys The Entrance Is Hidden In The Rear"....ha!Upon entering the bar/lounge, I knew I would love this place....why?- It's dark....I love dark bars, hate it when there's too much light....that's the Vampire side of me coming out.- The bartender was very cool & knowledgable....when I asked him if he had an IPA on tap, he suggested the Bells Two Hearted Ale IPA and proceeded to tell me about the different flavors I could expect.  Then he stopped by to check and see if he was right and if not, I could get something else.....awesome.- They had a band playing, but I arrived after they just finished their set...so I don't know what they were playing.....but I love small live music joints.- The lounge area has plush sofas and chairs to hang out with your friends.  I wish I wasn't solo....it would have been nice to sit there with The Better Half and a few friends.What a great recommendation by fellow Yelpers from Scottsdale/Phoenix....thanks!Will I return?  You bet!There's dining in the dark, and then there's wining in the dark. Yes, it's so dark in here that you won't want to bother trying to read their bible of a wine list - just ask your server for some recommendations. And because it's so dimly lit in here, it's a great spot for getting cozy and romantical with that someone special. The space is quite hidden, but once you make your way inside, you'll find a pretty huge space. There is tons of seating, so it's also a nice wine bar for gathering with friends. There's live music or a DJ on a nightly basis, so you not only get wonderful wines here, but a fun atmosphere. It's one of those places that you can spend hours on end at, but mix it up and have a nice dinner before or after at their sister spot around the corner, Cowboy Ciao. Makes for a perfect date night!Try their Boom Boom Syrah and get a mix of cheeses and meats to nibble on. Great thing is that you don't have to worry about having purple teeth or food on your face. Your date won't be able to notice it at all!The night is hot and sticky. The streets of old town have an eerily abandoned feeling as we realize it's 9pm on a Friday night and we are the only pedestrians around. Even in a sundress and sandals, I feel my skin glow with perspiration. After a bit of wandering, we realize we might be lost when I see a corridor lined with vines and trellises and my intuition and sense of adventure tells me to follow it. I grab his hand and lead the way blindly. He begins questioning my decision when I see a mysterious wooden door and before he can finish objecting we realize we found our way to the truth within. We step inside and it feels like we found the closet that leads to Narnia. We walk into another world. Another time. Relaxed sounds of jazz caress our ears as our eyes adjust to the darkness and candlelight. We take in the old world feel, the stone, the wood, the beautiful sleek bar...that seems to be beckoning us to sit. Couples and groups of friends absorbed in each other on cushy couches and stools all with a sense of privacy and feeling that there is no world outside of this place and there is no moment other than now. His eyes meet mine and we know this is exactly where we want to be.As we settle in at the bar, helpful suggestions are ready when we ask. He orders for me, as only seems appropriate in this mysterious and romantic era. Pinot Noir, Cabernet, plates of pâté, soppressata, brie, stilton white with cherries. I can taste the pure indulgence dripping off the mere words as they leave his mouth. The wine flows and the food is plentiful. Every sip, every bite, is something to savor and worthy of noting. Our conversation, whispers of love and beauty in each other's ears, lips close enough for a kiss. Knowledge of another world, remembrances of anyone else is lost as we fall under the spell that is Kazimierz. When the night is over and we have no choice but to go back to where we came from, we reluctantly step back out into the warm, heavy night air greeted by sounds of traffic and rickshaw drivers ringing their bells. But as we leave, we take with us a secret. A sexy, decadent, mysterious secret that lies behind an old wooden door in the heart of old town. The only way to discover that secret is to seek out that door and enter it yourself.I knew where this place was. I did. But when walking down the incredibly stinky alley towards the back, I started to question myself. It wasn't what I wanted. It wasn't what I expected. But it was kind of cool. The door man takes his role seriously. I like it, and he lets me in. I escort my date like a gentleman and we take seats by the bar to get an overlook. Live music is about to start. The bar personnel isn't to chatty but friendly. The prices are a little higher, but for the ambiance I feel they should be. They even have a few simple rules that could be classified as a dress code. Don't wear your hat backwards. I like it. Only kids get away with that, and this sure is no place for kids.Another rule is to adhere to the speakeasy - don't cuss, don't yell. I just love it. We ate a little; we drank a little and embraced the milieu with our fellow patrons. This place is a gem, in its dark shadowy appearance. I wouldn't want to change a thing. - IF you are into wine and feel you have the capacity to soak in the atmosphere - Go!- IF you feel that nobody should tell how to act - Don't go! - IF you like to people watch and/or listen to some live music that fits the venue better than your personality - Go!- IF you aren't sure what the front of your ball cap is, but you will not conform to the designed intent - Don't go!- IF you can't determine the proper volume of your voice, or control your flavoring of your language with the salty words that of a sailor - Seek help!This is the perfect place to conclude your evening in Scottsdale. After you have dinner at FnB (you did go to FnB didn't you?) you can just take a short walk to Kazimierz. FYI, the sign that says, "Like all good speakeasies, the entrance is hidden in the rear" isn't a joke - you enter at the rear of the building.It's a very relaxing environment. Comfortable seating (you can reserve a couch but I think there's a $ minimum) and there is live music every night.  They do serve food but the whole point of a wine bar is to drink some wine. I dare you to ask for a wine they don't have - their 75 page wine list has over 2,000 wines ranging in price from $10 to $10,000 (no, that wasn't a typo).  The wine list is actually sorted by price which is a nice touch. Unless you're planning on spending an hour or so looking over the wine list I suggest you look at it on their website before visiting.  Another option is to ask for the "Nifty Fifty" list - it has their most popular 50 wines.Go...sit back...relax...enjoy some good music and some wine.Back door entrance. Prohibition feel. Interior as far as the walls, are obviously artificial. Overall still provides an enjoyable atmosphere.  The best part:  The live band gets an A+++++!  Current music with their own style.  Definitely had me singing along to songs I don't normally like. The menu has great options and is affordable. Had some wine by the glass served in a personal carafe.  The truffle Gouda tastes so good. It is served on a platter with bread, apples, dried apricot, and nuts. Difficult to converse with friends during the band performance. I prefer to sit back snack and absorb the music.

Sooo, I'm a fan of The Blue Moose... not necessarily a sports fan, though. Lol. Although the day I went there to meet some friends, there was a football game on (and forgive me if I piss off all the die-hard sports fanatics out there; not my intention), and when the blue team scored (yes, this is the extent of my sports knowledge), they gave the whole bar free blue jello shots! Awesomeness!!! I did notice, however, how united everyone was at The Blue Moose -- it was like you walked into a friend's Superbowl party -- it felt like everyone there was family, which was pretty darn awesome in itself.

Restaurant name  Los Molcajetes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This place is definitely worth the trip! Molcajetes are their specialty, and it shows. "Molcajete" is Mexican Spanish for mortar, as in mortar & pestle. These are quite a bit larger than your usual kitchen mortar and made of volcanic rock. If you order one, your food is cooked and served in the mortar, and the sauce is still bubbling like lava when it comes to your table.The two of us couldn't decide exactly what we wanted in our shared molcajete (and damn, were we glad we shared one, they're enormous!), so we got the combination one that has beef, chicken, and shrimp, along with the usual lime wedge, cactus strips, radish slices, avocado slice, large slice of tomato, and amazing red sauce, served with either flour or corn tortillas (we chose corn; they were soft, white corn tortillas, and very tasty). That alone could have fed three people, so needless to say we didn't try anything else while we were there, save for the chips & salsa they give you in the beginning. That salsa was also super tasty!We were completely entertained the whole time watching Univision on the few mounted flat-screen TVs. Well, one of them was playing all music videos, and the other two were tuned to Univision. During most of our stay, a telenovela was on. This might not be as amusing to those who don't speak or read Spanish, but then again, I think they're pretty entertaining regardless.Previous reviews have noted that Los Molcajetes has separate English & Spanish menus and that they don't accept cards. Perhaps they've recently changed these things, because the menus we were given were bilingual, and there's a sign in Spanish in the back of the room that says they accept both credit and debit cards but charge $1 for the service.I also saw at least one previous reviewer who noted feeling like "idiot gringos" or something to that effect because they stood around waiting for someone to assist them when they walked in. When we entered, there was a sign just inside the door that said "Sientense donde gusten," which translates as "Seat yourselves wherever you'd like," and that's what we did. So, gringos, if you see this sign, pretend it says "Please seat yourselves" and act accordingly. ;) Be aware that if you do so, however, the very friendly waitress may think you speak Spanish and start out speaking to you in Spanish when she comes to your table, like she did with us. Both of us do understand and speak decent Spanish, but the waitress quickly realized that our main language was English, so she accommodated. Don't be scurrred, is what I'm sayin'.Yes, as mentioned by others, there are vendors (of CDs, beaded jewelry, etc.) and musicians who wander in & out of the place and will come by your table to see if you're interested in what they're selling. A simple "no thank you" and a smile is enough to get them to quietly move on; no one tried to hard-sell us or was particularly bothersome. I've noticed several (probably American) reviewers remark about this aspect of the restaurant negatively, and some have even knocked a star or two off for it. This phenomenon of wandering vendors is actually quite commonplace in restaurants throughout Latin America in all but the fanciest of places, and anyone who's travelled around a bit likely knows this and won't be aggravated by it.

Review Text :
This place has fantastic food at reasonable prices, incredibly friendly and attentive service, and a great atmosphere that lies somewhere between comfy cozy casual to romantic and classy. So why the hell is this place so empty??I'm sure it has some busy nights, but when I've gone there's hardly anyone in there. Perhaps it's just a well-kept secret. Or maybe people just forget it's there. Or it could be just that I've only gone there on off hours.I do have a few ideas actually - and this could explain the 4 star reviews instead of 5. The food is very rich and the portions are huge. It's almost old fashioned cuisine. Everything I've had has been awesome, but I think they could get a little more modern with some of their dishes... although they do offer some good contemporary or at least unique stuff.It's also pretty dark in there - I would definitely bring dates here (if I was single) for the intimacy, but not everyone likes to eat in such a dark restaurant. This is also a little old-school. I guess that's it - that's the only thing I can find fault with here. Otherwise, it's got a cool patio and a great bar, the kitchen is open until midnight and it's just an all-around solid place to hang out.Okay - I've been going here fairly regularly and I've upgraded this to a 5 star place. The food is awesome and the people here are rad. It's one of my new favorites. I don't know what I was thinking giving it a 4. I'm stupid.This place ranges from quite busy to comfortably laid back as it turns out. It's always an easy place to go though. As for the pronunciation, I used to say it like "Frasier's" instead of like it's spelled and then for some reason started saying it like it's spelled for the last few months. Tonight I asked the owner and he confirmed it was pronounced like Frasier's. I feel stupid yet again, but at least I've been sending people there.The first time I ate here was when my in-laws visited two years ago.  I had the teriyaki glazed salmon, and found it to be just okay.  The garlic mashed potatoes are whipped so I didn't really enjoy that either.After the food situation at ZooBrew was a bust, Dottsy Z and I with our plus ones zipped over here for dinner on Friday evening.  First off, we had excellent service, and there was free live soft porn for entertainment.  Stay tuned for Dottsy's review--she had the best view of the "action."  We started off with the toasted ravioli with meat.  I didn't think it was great, but I would have preferred the cheese.  My husband had a steak which he said was very good.  I went with the smoked salmon appetizer for a light dinner.  "Light dinner."  There are two words that usually aren't next to each other in my vocabulary.  With the salmon was warm pita, a horseradish mousse, and capers.  I couldn't detect the horseradish which was fine with me.  The plate was a nice combination of flavors.  A little green apple or cheese might be a nice addition, but I enjoyed it.I might have bumped Frasher's to four stars had Dottsy's plus one not found a piece of plastic in his sandwich (supposedly from the turkey).  As it is, I still can't say that I'm a fan.

My grandma loved me.This grandma only offered me . . . . margarine?  Really?  In today's day and age and grandma has no butter?  Its not just about science here, its about taste.  Unfortunately grandma didn't have that either.The hash-browns were flavorless.  The ham was only cooked on one side.  The french toast had a form of cinnamon in it but it still lacked in flavor, explain to me how that is possible?  I'm still perplexed.  The maple syrup was a far, distant step cousin to anything maple.  The coffee, a measure in any restaurant, was miserably lacking.We went to Grandma's Kitchen based on the two reviews here on Yelp and I was sadly, sadly misled.  :(My grandmothers weren't this rude and their cooking was INFINITELY better-tasting.  Don't waste the trip.  I ordered eggs that had absolutely no taste to them.  The waitress went out of her way to be rude to me and other guests there.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service (I think they are mentally ill) and very bad food.Was looking for a breakfast place so we decided to stop at Grandma's Kitchen.. The atmosphere was so-so, they should have had music on or something! The waitress wasn't mean or rude, just kinda surly. I ordered the bacon, spinach and mushroom omelette, minus the 'shrooms. When I got the omelette I noticed the spinach didn't look very fresh, and upon first bite I could taste it: CANNED SPINACH!! Ew. I'm assuming the mushrooms would have been canned too, glad I left them off..

When I hit a quarter of a century in years, I decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango. Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.Now I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.Cha, cha, cha.MEDIZONA.It even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.An upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?Intriguing.Rabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?Wicked fricken good.It puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.Wild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?Melt in my mouth delicious.Try to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans "haricot verts." Merde!Roast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?Eh. The lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.The service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. The customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.But then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.So I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off. No need to return.

It's 9pm on a wednesday night, I just landed from San Francisco and I hadn't slept the night before.I need sustenance.Prime rib for $11.99? Sure why not.I just wish I had fresh horseradish. Also, a little more attention from the waitress would've been nice. The place was EMPTY.The prime rib was annihilated.Harold's is worth the drive up north if you're looking for a good 'ol country / biker bar to drink beer, listen to country music, and/or watch Steelers games... It's a huge space with several rooms inside and a great big outdoor patio too.  Up until my most recent visit, I might have told you that the service and food were pretty consistent too... but unfortunately, both the service and food sucked during our last visit!Since I've been going to Harold's for years though, I'm sticking to a 3 star review in hopes that our last experience was a fluke. In the past, I've enjoyed both the beef ribs and the salmon entrees at Harold's.  I went for a steak salad last visit and was extremely disappointed - it was pretty nasty. I also found it funny that when my bf asked about the soup of the day, the waitress said it was 'clam chowder' and that it was 'good when fresh' but she didn't recommend it the day we were there... huh, that kinda makes you wonder?!Harold's does offer steamed broccoli as well as plenty of other side items including french fries, coleslaw, baked potato, and more.  Their menu is huge with something for everyone, but I think Nadia C has the right idea in going to Harold's for beer and burgers!It's a shame my experience sucked, but to be honest we didn't come during any events at the restaurant, and we came in a large group. Also I didn't choose to eat here; we were here for a celebration.No one sat us; we arranged tables ourselves outside. A waiter eventually came 10 minutes later to get our drink orders.Prices for the food are too high, especially since the quality is bad. I had the BBQ burger, and there was a dot of barbecue sauce imprinted in the bun, none on the burger. The sauteed onions sat in a pool of grease on top of the burger. The sweet potato waffle fries ($2 extra) were soaked in oil, so bad that it took 2-3 napkins just to soak up some of the grease off of one piece. I ate the burger because I was very hungry, but it wasn't any good. My friend ordered chicken fingers, and for $8 she got 4 measly-looking pieces. I don't know where all the good reviews are coming from. Maybe they have good bands play or good drinks that I don't know about; but the food is absolutely terrible.

My Lao daughter and my not-Lao-but-knows-Lao-sista and I are going to lunch! My sista says this is her favorite Lao place to eat. I'm SO in. Did someone say PAPAYA SALAD?! So I met them up. Sista had already ordered her tripe soup. I'm not into tripe but I tried the broth and it was tasty. My Lao daughter got the kao biek! It was SO good! She doesn't like veggies so there wasn't any cilantro or green onions in it but the broth was delish and the noodles were nommy too. I put in an order for Nam and Papaya Salad... Is it Lao style? Yes. Do I want crab in it? No thanks. I ordered Medium spice... However she interpreted that, it came out nice and spicy! Made my nose run and crave for more! The papaya salad it served with cabbage on the side - if you want pork rinds, you're in a Lao store and can buy a package. I should have! There are also pieces of that green bean in the papaya salad.. Matua.. However you spell it - it's delish! The Nam came out with cilantro and lettuce leaves on the side and the nam itself was topped with crispy red peppers. Make my nose drip some more! I'm eatin' good! There are little slivers of I think ginger in the Nam too which I dodnt care for much just cuz you know when you get a mouthful of ginger it is rather overpowering and unpleasant. For me anyway.They have quite a bit more food here than your typical Lao store where you can just order a few things or there are some items in the fridge that were previously made. I like it! I will definitely be back to try the Larb Gai and get some more Kao biek. And papaya salad. And nam... =) And some nice man thought my sista was SO fione he bought our lunch! Score! Shoutout to Mike and his mama, Dao! Mike your mom was super nice and knows my Lao sista too! =)))

Yay!  Another place to add to the breakfast rotation!  With the BF residing in North Phoenix, there are not that many options when it comes to finding a good breakfast spot in the area.  So, when we were craving a hearty meal last Sunday morning, we went on a mission (to Cave Creek) to find somewhere new to add to our existing rotation of Kashman's, The Good Egg, The General Store, and Einstein's Bagels.  We found it at Oak's!  Unfortunately, we aren't the only ones that found it...The place was packed when we walked in, but it was the kind of packed where it's a good sign!  It was warm and cozy with a positive energy in the air.  We put our name on the list and the hostess brought us both coffee.  Jared, being the aggressive guy he is, found us two seats at what Oak's considers their bar (I think), so we ended sitting there instead of waiting for a table.  Ice waters arrived immediately and the menu had all kinds of eggs, pancakes, waffles, French toast, and more.  I ordered the harvest (wheat) pancakes along with an egg white omelet - yes, they have egg whites too!  Jared went with the French toast and ate my hash browns.  Everything was served with melt in your mouth butter and syrup.  We cleaned our plates, it was that good!Needless to say, we've agreed to add Oak's to the breakfast rotation.  If you don't mind the trek to Cave Creek, go check it out for yourself.  With a huge menu of items to choose from, there is something for everyone... kid friendly too!

Review Text :
Aunties Karen and Sandy own and run this Las Vegas Jerkys shop.  It's located inside the Las Vegas Club Hotel (head towards the back of the casino).  They do a WONDERFUL job with customer service.  Their products are excellent.  What I like best about this place (besides the wonderful customer service) is that many of their products have recipes that are rooted from the Islands.  That, coupled with the local friendly customer service, equals a WINNER!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#ykPNkbsRAqmW0dgFsMioBgThere are literally 50-75 types of beef & pork jerkys to purchase here.  There are also wonderful candies, cookies, chips, lup chong, chocolates, etc. to purchase here.  I got so excited here, I literally spent $350 on goodies for my visiting relatives and items to bring back to Honolulu when I go back home.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#qeyJ6o2dDKlmwlbBLduvcQTop of the list is the Islander Brand Lup Chong (Chinese Sausage).  These are traditional Chinese sausages that were originally crafted in Honolulu, and produced in Los Angeles, CA.  The owners purchased the rights to the recipe and produce the sausages for the store.  These sausages are thick and a bit on the sweet side.  Wonderful for fried rice, baked salmon with lup chong, or just eating along with steamed rice.  OMGDELICIOUS!  Get it!  Grade:  A+http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#_GPmeVlAXT4xVMjgka_R_Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#TT763Urq_CmdhbRuxch5WwIslander Brand Beef Jerkey is another favorite.  Comes in plain, spicy, peppered, pork, and spicy pork.  This is your traditional beef jerkey, but the flavors are out of this word.  Grade:  A-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#cEO3s2d_3MfdlDuvY29jsgIslander Brand Sweet Dried Pork.  Aunty Karen calls this the jerky that taste like char siu.  These pork slices are cured and dried, and actually taste like you are eating sweet char siu (Chinese red roast pork).  The flavor is delicious, but the texture is a bit on the tough side.  Delicious, nonetheless.  Grade:  B+Karen's Bagel Chips.  DELICIOUS!!!   Aunty Karen makes bagel chips that come in a variety of flavors - cinnamon sugar, blueberry, cranberry, plain, etc.  The most popular flavor is the cinnamon.  The bagel chips come in a container and must be hand-carried if you are traveling.  Fun to eat, flavorful, and crunchy!

Both Aunty Karen and Sandy were super helpful in helping me put my order together and to make suggestions on what to purchase.  They were so much like family, they threw in a free apron and gave my family keiki toy cars when we were leaving!   AMAZING!   Mahalos, aunties!Product Grade:  A-Service Grade:  A+Worth the money grade:  A-Overall Impression Grade:  A!

Review Text :
At about 7 pm we arrive... a bunch of pilots, flight attendants and mechanics/maintenance ... about 14... they were able to seat us with in 10 minutes... i was stoked!!we are all seated outside... it was such a beautiful night last night... it was soo nice! the waiter comes up... and says hi... but WE had to ASK him his name... and he was way to relaxed... not very outgoing at all... he gave me the feeling like we interrupted his "Smoke" break.... my bad while we were waiting for our food i asked for some bread... they brought out a little plate of maybe 8-10 pieces of bread on it... keep in mind we all have not eaten since before noon that day... and we all looked at the plate like um.... o...k... when the food FINALLY came i was soo excited... the whole place had smelled amazing since walking up from the parking lot!! (which was kinda small and packed) but i was quickly disappointed... the pizza was soo thin... the toppings fell right off the pizza.. and there was virtually no sauce at all!! :( the crust was the best part of the whole thing... my friend and i decided to get a piece of cheesecake to hopefully save the meal... NOPE... not even close... i almost wanted to cry... cheesecake is my all time most favorite dessert and it was ruined! the crust was waxy and just gross... the cake part tasted a little weird... kinda like the crust and to mushy.. like they didn't give it enough time to set.. it was awful... their menu has salad appetizers, pizza and calzones... and desert.. that's it... no pastas or anything else so there isn't much to choose from... :( their water with lemon was my favorite part of the meal.. sad.. Over all..... The bathrooms were decent.. Parking was not to great..The food Sucked.... Service could have been WAY better.... and it was WAY OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!!! if i ever go back... I'm just gonna order Water with extra lemon...Great pizza, albeit a little overpriced.  They are a little stingy where they charge full price even if you get the toppings on half of the pizza.  Whatever, they make a damn good pizza. With that perfectly crisped thin crust and good portion of toppings.The service is a little slow, and the pizza does a take a bit, but it is all worth it.  Also a good place to cougar watch, for some reason they love this place!We ordered a pizza and a Caesar Salad with chicken "to go" tonight, and I'm giving a generous update with three stars... It's been a year and a half since my last review, and I have to say, Grimaldi's - I'm not as much a fan as I was back then.The pizza was half cooked and only tasted decent when we put it in the oven for another 10 minutes and covered it with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.  The chicken in the Caesar Salad that was supposed to be grilled was not - it looked like completely processed meat that was served luke warm; it was so gross looking that I didn't even taste it.  I'll stick with the original review in saying that Grimaldi's (especially the Old Town location) is a decent place to go if you've got a large group... but it's nothing so special with a smaller group or for take-out.  I won't be rushing back!If I could give this 4.5 I would.  Grimaldis is pretty damn awesome.  Its the best pizza you can get outside of NY and I have been to many of them.  This one was almost as good as the others except for a few things.We went to eat in when we first got into town on Thursday.  We were the only people in there for about 15 minutes.  We placed our order but it took forever.  The manager came by and apologized and even said there would be a little discount on the bill.  We ordered our usual, large pepperoni and garlic pizza and we shared a small Mediterranean salad.The salad came out pretty quick and it was tasty as usual.  The pizza finally came out and you know what?  It was a tad greasy.  Like greasy on the bottom.  I have never experienced that at any of the Grimaldis I have been to before.  The pizza tasted damn fine but somehow not as good as the NY/Las Vegas/Other Scottsdale locations.  We finished up our meal and they brought over the check.  There was no discount on it like the manager had said there would be.  I hate complaining so I didn't even say anything, but thats kind of messed up that they tell you there will be a discount for the long wait and then it never happens.  Semi weak sauce!We ordered pickup 2 other nights we were there and that went smooth.  One night I had to go in and pick up my pizza from the bar.  The other evening, you just had to pull up out back and they brought it out to you which was nice.Overall its still the best pizza you can get out here in the West.  The sauce, fresh mozzarella and thin crust cannot be beat.  Awesome pizza and thanks to the stupid EPA and coal ovens, we cant get one out here in CA.  Its a damn shame.  If Arnold would taste one of these pizzas, I bet he wouldn't give a shit if a tad more pollution enters our airspace ;-).  Grimaldis pizza is amazing and well worth it!Came here again this past week.  Ordered a personal white pizza with cheese and a large pepperoni and garlic.  It was awesome!  Some of the best pizza ever!  It was better than last month when I came and that's why this is getting bumped up to 5 stars.  We got our stuff much quicker this time and our waitress and the manager were on top of everything.  A great meal before the Diamondbacks game.  Grimaldis pizza is simply the best!I really don't require a whole lot from a pizza (or a pizza joint, for that matter). You don't have to hand build yourself a big old brick oven, grind your own semolina wheat into flour, milk your own cows for the milk for the mozzarella and press your own olives into super duper virgin olive oil, to impress me.I don't need for to you to have been blessed by Oprah or Jerry or any of their friends.All I need is a well-made and high quality pie, friendly and comfortable surroundings, a glass or two of a nice cab or syrah and friendly service and smiling faces!That's really pretty simple (but then, I am a simple man with simple needs...almost humble, really...and noted far and wide for my humility and modesty...I guess I would say "renowned").But enough about me...let's talk pies!Grimaldi's has 'em and a ton of people seem to like 'em!Rightly so...they are terrific!The Beautiful Carin and I wandered down to Grimaldi's last evening for dinner...split a Caesar, had a pie and couple of glasses of syrah...sat in the back, near the kitchen and watched the chef's hand toss the pies and stoke the oven with coal...All dark wood, red accents and black and white checked table cloths...just the way a pizza joint should be!Time to share our weeks with each other and decide how we want our weekend to look...a lovely Friday evening ritual...what a great meal and a great way to slide into the weekend!Tasty pizza dough, savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want, all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven!For those of us who don't always like to be told what to do...we get to customize our pizza (and the wait staff doesn't look at you like you just pooped in your chair for having the temerity to attempt to have a pizza pie the way you want it, instead of the way the pizza pooh-bah thinks you should have it)...that's right...have it any way you want!And yes, they get busy at Grimaldi's and you might have to wait from time to time, but the pleasant people who work the front of the house go out of their way to make you feel welcome and wanted!* They give you pizza shaped pagers to let you know when they are ready for you, rather than telling you that you have to come find them every hour to find out if you are going be able to eat;* There are tons of things to do nearby (within easy walking distance) if there is a bit of a wait, as well as a terrific and reasonably priced full bar to enhance your appetite;* They give you reasonably accurate estimates of the wait time, so you can decide what you would like to do (as opposed to telling you the wait is "2 hours" and then telling you 4 hours later that they have run out of everything and they are done for the night...too bad for you)In other words, Grimaldi's operates as a good restaurant should, providing an excellent product and wonderful and friendly service at very reasonable price points!I understand that one's taste in pizza is subjective and "who's best" is the subject of nearly endless and tedious debate...I mean really tedious...I'm not going be the one to broker peace in our time in the never ending Pizza Wars.For me, Grimaldi's is a slice of contentment, satisfaction and relaxation...I don't care who wins the Pizza Wars, as long as I can get a Friday night pie every week or two at Grimaldi's!I'm a huge fan of Grimaldi's Pizza.  The Better Half and I stopped in here for dinner and we had a huge appetite.....which is dangerous in a Pizza joint for me.I ordered:Caprese Salad - $7Personal Sized Pizza ($9) with:Sundried Tomatoes - $4Red Peppers - $4Ricotta Cheese - $2Mushrooms - $2Jalapenos - $2http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=DZ7xu0LF2IIg2_dI1c_CrAThe Better Half ordered a personal sized Pizza ($9) with:Pepperoni - $2Mushrooms - $2Feta Cheese - $2Basil - $2http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=1PaOTe8Ys9uJUP3u4DjHiQYeah, all toppings are al la carte here....so it's not cheap.  The Pizza was awesome!  I enjoyed every bite.  The combination of the sweet taste of Sun Dried Tomatoes combined with the spicy kick of Jalapenos mixed in with Ricotta, Mushrooms, and Red Peppers hit the spot!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=l4mZAt7mXpslp4LqexFy5gThe Better Half enjoyed her Pizza too.  Since I'm on my no Meat diet, I took her word for it....as much as I was tempted to give it a try, I resisted....maybe next time.To wash it down, she had 2 glasses of Brazin Zinfandel $8 ea, I had 2 O'douls $4 ea.  All in, the dinner was $72 before tip.Overall, it was a nice dinner.  I finished my food, she took home 1/2 of her Pizza.Return Factor - 100%In an unlucky turn of events, I ended up having a grand experience with my new favorite, Grimaldi's. More of my reviews lately have began with me aimed for one place and ending up at another, and I'll start with "this one isn't any different." Maybe it's a trend, maybe it's indecisive decision making, or maybe it's just plain old coincidence. Mostly because I don't believe in fate; I'll go with coincidence, but for those of you who mystify the universe in a shroud of hocus pocus, wizardry, and magic then feel free to call it fate.While I make the claim of "My New Favorite" I'm not really comparing it to much outside of oreganos, humble pie, upper crust, and streets of new york. I've yet to visit bianco, cibo, and plenty other wild-west, pizza slingers round these parts.Earlier this week I planed my birthday lunch at Cibo in Downtown PHX. A calorie and carb packed, delicious birthday meal. Much to my dismay, a quick pre-lunch look at the Cibo menu (on their website), seemed to be lacking a certain sauce and cheese covered, carbo loaded delight. After a call in confirming this fear, a fast yelping finger pointed me to Grimaldi's in Scottsdale. It didn't hurt that they had also sent me a voucher for free birthday pizza; I guess my wife signed me up for their email list. :-)On Sunday afternoon; even though they were busily serving plenty of customers, there was no wait. I placed an order with the server for a manhattan while I checked out their menu. Regretfully I had to send my drink back, it tasted more like straight whiskey, and bottom shelf at that. I decided to go with the house red wine in stead; which was decent and chilled, a bit odd for a red, but it worked out well.We dined on a large meatball, ricotta pizza and a large mediterranean salad. The salad was huge, big enough for 3 people to share, and each end up with 2 portions. The pizza came out with a perfectly crisped crust, evenly distributed slices or meatball and ricotta, and was delicious!We finished off our meal sharing a blueberry cheese cake AND a canolie, it was my birthday after all. I cant say that I've had many canolies in my life, but if they're all this good, there will be an eternal place in my heart set aside for these delectible deserts.Happy dining friends, and godspeed to all your yelping fingers!My rating is based on the dessert, because it's the most important meal of the day ;)First the food info. I didn't have pizza, I had house salad (bland, not great), green olives (not pitted!!! My teeth would have appreciated a heads up), the bruschetta (I was about an hour late to the party and they were mush by then), the cheesecake (sweet heaven!), cannoli (I thought they were okay, but those with me were in love). I have never been a cheesecake fan, but this place changed that :D It was soft & sweet and just amazing. I'm told that they change their cheesecake selection based on the seasons (that confused me because we only really have 2 in Az, lol). I can't wait for the strawberry cheesecake in the summer!!!They have a small parking lot behind the pizzeria building, but there's plenty of street parking.You know, the sign of really good pizza is how long the leftovers last in your frig.  For me, a Grimaldi's sausage and pepperoni has never last more than twelve hours.  I know.  It stinks.  I keep promising myself as the server is boxing up the remains of our dinner, I'll have this for lunch tomorrow, it will be so good.These leftovers never make it to lunch the next day.Sometimes I wake up at two a.m..  There will be that familiar craving - ok, I'll just go grab one slice, and leave the rest for lunch.  Back to bed.Up again at five a.m.  Time to get ready for work.  man, I'm hungry.  Scarf.  No more lunch pizza.  Make bologna sandwich for lunch.Service has always been spot-on, I can honestly say I have never had bad service at this store, and I've been going for years.  My Peroni is always refilled, the food is always perfectly done, and the once or twice a mistake was made, the Manager caught it and brought us a free pie before we even knew there was a problem.  What?  MORE pizza?  Yeah, I"m gonna refuse that.Great pies, great service, nice ambiance, especially with the courtyard patio.  Prices are compatible with other "high-end" pizza places, but the value is greater.

I was drug here kicking and screaming by my hair! Imagine you are out with your "friends" It's late OK very late or maybe early around 3am ish any way.. Your drunk and starving what do you do demand Waffle house or Jack in the Box! No such luck with this bunch, they pulled in to Village Inn. I am not a happy drunk at this point. I finally come to terms with the fact that our designated driver will not drive me elsewhere and begin to review the menu. I decide on a patty melt with onion rings. I am whining about my choice and just generally being a belligerent drunk wanting to boycott. Then the food came and quickly I might add. Holy rye bread drenched in butter and grilled to perfection. This was a damn good patty melt. I wanted to order another! I have been back 3 times since sober to get it and it is good. The onion rings I get with it are decent too. That is why they have a 5 star from me the deliciousness of that little patty melt they get 4 snaps in a circle!Damn Patty is like a monkey on my back now, Just gotta get my fix!

First off , I have never gotten out of that restaurant without paying at least $30. WIth a family of four , around $80+ not including drinks. The food is okay if you like a slice of pizza that is mainly made up of sauce and bread with barely any cheese or toppings.So much sauce , it was like soup! Then to top off the crappy food was the staff. It is 100+ degrees outside and they had a problem with us wearing shorts and flip flops. But hey they still let us in. Maybe the reason our food was crappy was because they didn't like our clothes. Until things change , I won't be wasting any more money here.I suggest that if this restaurant wants to survive , they need to re think their menu , and straighten up the employees attitudes , big time.And to everyone else who put more than 3 stars on your review , either you don't have tastebuds , or you got paid to do your review.

I haven't been to Verrazano's in quite some time but after a few trusted Yelpers kept mentioning their pizza on YT, I had it in my mind to come back for a slice when the craving hit.I stopped in today for a single slice of cheese. The pizza was solid and I really liked the crust. Not too thin, not too thick. Perfect texture and chewyness factor was on point. For $2.25 I'll be back for a basic slice from time to time. They also offer quite a few lunch specials at reasonable prices. Why I always forget about this place when searching for pizza in the area is beyond me.Verrazano Pizza is located in a not-so-busy shopping center, nestled in between a barber shop and a CVS. I came here for a quick bite to eat before work and was pretty much satisfied with what I ordered.Customer service was alright, but I could tell that some of the workers there are forcing their kindness, which ends up being an awkward experience for both parties involved, to be honest. I had two slices of their pepperoni and mushroom pizza, New York style. It was thin and crispy but packed with a lot of flavor from the two toppings. I just wish there was a little bit more cheese on the slices because it seemed a little sparing.This pizza joint is pretty convenient because it's right around the corner from where I live, so I'll probably order from them again in the future. Plus, the prices for their pizzas (whole pies and individual slices) aren't that bad and won't break the bank! Sounds like a deal to me! I have to try their wings and (maybe) their salad options next time.

I came here on the Thanksgiving morning after running a race and I was hungry and cold (running in a cold weather, my lungs were hurting. I was surprised how busy they were.  I ordered a cup of hot chocolate. It really helped me warm up.  Food was okay, gave me the energy I needed. Standard iHop food.Service was great! Considering how busy they were, our server kept up with great service with nice smile. Food came fast, I ate very quick as I was so hungry, I was on my way with full tummy.

Review Text :
It was my second time visit to Black Bear Diner since a couple years back. All I can remember is that I had a big portion of comfortable and tasty breakfast meal with a strong cup of coffee( I enjoy drinking bold in the morning). I decided to try it again on one Sunday morning. When I walked in, it was a full house! I waited about 5 min and got a table. I knew what I wanted,,, Omelette, Omelette, & Omelette :) *My Happy Meal of the Dayyy: 1. South of the Border Omelette-seasoned ground beef OR chorizo with ortega chilies, jack cheese, avocado and homemade salsa, served with a flour tortilla. Choice of strip-cut hash browns OR red diced potatoes($8.99): I had the chorizo and the red potatoes.. 2. Coffee with vanilla cream and sugar: It was bold & smooth. Well, I really enjoyed my meal. The service was provided promptly by friendly waitress. The portion was HUGE that I had to take some home. There was no cut-off time for ordering breakfast here. I prefer real all day breakfast places for a late breakfast( I am pretty much a late riser on weekends). I noticed that a full service menu is offered for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'll definitely give them another shot. Nowadays, I can't seem to find very many good hole in the wall, mom and pop owned places to have a breakfast in LV. It is definitely a chain world out here in the city! Sad, really....However, The Black Bear Diner serves up some good home cooking :) There are no strangers here at the Black Bear - only friends you haven't met yet :PFirst time going here tonight with the family. We decided to go since none of the "usual" choices was working out. Thankfully it was really close to where we live. The service, at least to me, is quite good. There was some waiting to do but not horrible. For drinks: mom, lil' bro, and I ordered the OJ. Mom's bf ordered coke lol. I'm an OJ-type of girl. I even ask my grandma to buy bag-fulls of oranges just to freshly squeeze them for me in the morning. I have to say, their OJ was yummy--didn't have too much pulp but you can tell they're not store-bought. I ordered the Bear Paw Chicken-Fried Steak alongside red-skinned mashed potatoes, corn bread muffin and lots of heavenly gravy. I also ordered a side of their famous Sweet Cream pancakes (short stack).  Mom ordered the T-Bone steak with baked potato and their muffin as well. Bro ordered their Gardenstyle Veggie burger with Jack cheese and fries on the side. Mom's bf ordered the BIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and eggs. He got it with hash browns, but instead of the biscuits he opted for the pancakes. My chicken noodle soup and mom's salad came first. Soup was okay; not salty and the serving size was just right (since the main dishes were HUGE). We waited a little bit for our orders but I wasn't complaining at all, since I'd usually be getting antsy after 10-15 minutes of waiting. I got my pancakes first, slobbered butter all over and pretty much drenched them in syrup (yum!) Short stack comes with two pancakes the size of regular dinner plates at my house, my mom was surprised at how their "short stack" was too big of an order. The top pancake was a little burnt, so that's a bit of a downside, but the bottom one was the most perfect pancake I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. I've been searching for a good breakfast place and I think I've found it in Black Bear! As I was still waiting for my main order, I took a bite off of my brother's veggie burger. The texture of the patty told my taste buds it ain't real meat, but the taste definitely passed the test. Their fries were also pretty good, I actually ate a lot of it (sorry bro!) My mom also gave me a piece of her steak; now, I'm not much of a steak person when I'm not craving it, but that piece of meat was juicy and flavorful. My chicken-fried steak finally came, and the first bite was enough for me to rave about this place. I've had "country-fried" or "chicken-fried" steak from other places, namely casinos, and they all were too salty or too dry/hard or just plain yucky! I didn't even used a knife to cut it, and when I put it in my mouth it just melted. It was crunchy and creamy and all sorts of heavenly goodness in one bite! The side of mashed potatoes were also quite awesome, I like how they used red potatoes--best kind for mashed. The veggies tasted good too; a little greasy at times but hey, that's what diner food is all about. We couldn't go for dessert, everyone was just too full and in food heaven by the time we were done. Gave our server $10 tip since she was attentive the whole time. Definitely going back next time I'm craving breakfast food :DSo i went here for the 1st time a few weeks ago.Wow I have been missing out big time...This place is fantastic! It was hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there were so many tempting items. I got the Bigfoot Chicken fried steak and it comes with soup or salad and a corn bread muffin I chose a salad with ranch which I must say was very tasty ranch and the muffin was so sweet and soft. You also get a choice of sides I  ordered the red skinned mashed potatoes and baked beans let me tell you I have never had baked beans that good they were sweet and spicy and had sausage and bacon in them mmm mmm good. Now on to the main dish the chicken fried steak it was tasty fried goodness covered in homemade gravy the meat was very good quality this is definitely the best chicken fried steak I have ever had.Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the service was excellent and the price was right.I cant wait to return to this restaurant there are so many other delicious looking items I wanna try.We had a failed attempt at going to brunch elsewhere so I popped on my app to figure out some of my bookmarks. It's funny, I used to live in walking distance, but I never tried to go then and a bit sad that perhaps I missed out. It was busy, but the wait was not long at all, about 5-10 minutes. We were amused and creeped out by the decor in the meantime. There are a bunch of teddybears lining a ledge around the main dining room. They somehow seem to just be looking at me, at all times. Hehehe. The BF and I shared: Chicken fried steak - I think this is one of the best ones we've had. Its really crispy and didn't sog up with the gravy. Gravy was flavorful and the combination of the too wasn't overly salty which I find many tend to be. Fajita chicken omelette - this was just OK. A bit too much peppers and everything was in big chunks that it would have been better diced up in it and with cheese present. I can't remember if it's supposed to come with cheese, but it should, I wouldn't order again. The egg itself is fluffy though so they can make a solid omelette here but these toppings I wouldn't do again. Your breakfast comes with a choice of potatoes or fruit. We tried both kinds. Normally I would pick country potatoes over hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns here are slightly bigger shreds are were good. The country potatoes has peppers and onions with it and those were decent too. My only critique is I'm going to order extra crispy on both next time as the country only had one side sizzled and the hashbrowns would be better with a more crispy top to contrast the soft potatoes below.You get a bread as well. I got one of their biscuits which is pretty good of a biscuit that I normally don't eat a lot of my bread during breakfast, but I had to eat some with honey and butter. The BF really wanted a pancake, but a short stack is too much and their prices are odd in that it's only $1 less than a full stack so it makes it kinda not worth it. Apparently, you can sub your bread for one pancake and I don't think they charge for that either. We wanted a blueberry one and that was 99cents upgrade. This pancake was really good. I love that they put a lot of blueberries inside the batter since heating up the berries brought out their sweetness and the cake itself was nicely fluffy. Sidenote, I love their own bottled habanero hot sauce that is on every table. I sprinkled that onto my omelette. Service was friendly and attentive despite it being busy. She took her time giving us suggestions and answering our questions. We were checked on often and got our drinks filled efficiently. We were seated quickly and we were checked out fast as well. My first time, but it seems they know what they're doing. Despite it being a chain, it didn't feel like one and all items made from scratch is a huge plus. Most "mom and pops" don't make their own sausages or potatoes. We took home some treats too. Their bear claw was alright...the inside was plain sugar with strong cinnamon and not a smooth filling paste. It is better eaten warm and it's more puff pastry and not croissant like some people think it will be. It's one of those personal preference type things. Their blackberry cobbler had me confused as cobbler to me equals crumb top and crust on the bottom and this had crust all the way on the top. Once we opened it, there was only crust on top, none of the bottom just fruit filling hence the cobbler part I suppose since it's a partial crust only. It was decent with lots of blackberry in it, I just wish it was a actual mini pie because the crust was flaky. Even with a few minor hiccups/preferences, I was still pretty pleased so we will be back I'm sure. If you want big portioned all American, no frills breakfast, this probably should be on the shortlist of choices. If you are into chicken fried steak this will probably be the best you can get in the city.Black Bear Diner is an icon that has stood at the corner of Jones and Tropicana for years. Contrary to what the name might imply to some people, Black Bear Diner did not start out serving bear meat. It started as an inn in Mount Shasta, California that overlooked a strawberry patch that was inhabited by both people and black bears. Approximately ninety years later Black Bear Diner seems to be a healthy business. They have several locations including this very one at the northwest corner of Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard.   Black Bear Diner operates by six (6) credos. I have put each credo to the test. This review lists each credo with Yelping feedback. Please bear with me, while I grow my yelp into a growl while I give feedback on each of the six credos.Credo #1: We will make Black Bear Diner a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. We offer you great food and an experience reminiscent of a time when a small-town restaurant was the place to go for talk, friendship and atmosphere.A Yelper's growl: On my visits that occurred during the afternoon of June 22 and the morning of June 23, 2013; the lodge theme made me relaxed. There is nothing like a hundred stuffed bears to make me feel at ease. Black Bear Diner reminds me more of a bear themed Cracker Barrel than a small-town restaurant. The menu which mimics a newspaper and the place mats were interesting reading material. Being in the information age where friends, especially yelp friends are within the touch of a handheld device, I could say that the excellent Verizon reception contributed to making this a place for friendship.Credo #2: We are dedicated to serving freshly prepared home cooking. From scratch sausages and biscuits to our legendary Black Bear Cobbler, everyone at Black Bear Diner goes the extra mile to provide you with the best in good old fashioned family food, prepared fresh every day.A Yelper's growl: Based on the Shasta cheeseburger with fries that I ate on June 22 and the Bear's Choice Breakfast special that I ate on June 23; I thought that the food was good yet not extraordinary. I would have appreciated more cheese on the Shasta cheeseburger, warmer fries, and a choice of syrups and toppings for the pancakes.Credo #3 We deliver each meal just the way you order it.A Yelper's growl: This ought to be mentioned when the server takes your order. When I ordered the Bear's Choice Breakfast, this would have been nice if it was brought to my attention. I would of enjoyed more beacon instead of pancakes.Credo#4: We believe in value-hearty portions of good food. We buy huge platters and we fill them, so don't be afraid to take leftovers home!A Yelper's growl: The portions are huge. However, I feel that instead of filling up a lot of the plate with fries that they ought to replace some of them with the choice of potato salad or cole slaw. For the record fries are not the kind of food that tastes good warmed up. Credo #5: We feature healthy options because we care about our customers.A Yelper's growl: I do not go to a diner, especially named Black Bear to eat healthy. I say good for them for featuring healthy options. I would like to add that all the stuffed bears and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health. Stuffed bears have a way of reducing my stress level. Credo #6: If you have comments that bear repeating, please tell us. If you have extraordinary service, or have something to growl about, we want to hear from you. Please visit our website to let us know how we are doing.A Yelper's growl: Growling on business websites is not my style. My style is to growl on Yelp. With that in mind my growl of Black Bear Diner is 3  1/2 stars.***The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. This is review 90***The first thing you notice about this place is that they are actually true to theme of the name of their restaurant. Everywhere you look, there is something that has to do with black bears. You don't see that at every place you go to eat at.Since im trying to stay away from red meat, I ordered the Spicy Turkey on Sourdough Bread. It came with onion rings. If you refer to my pic, the sandwich itself is pretty big. I gotta say it was very tasty with a little kick to it. It Definitely filled me up.Service was above average meaning she came around and checked up on me every now and then. I only had to ask for refills once so she was on point for the most part.I would say this place is a decent place to go to if plan A falls through. For some reason I thought they were 24 hours but they have had the same hours since they opened long ago.So this place to me is ok in my book. Decent food, service, and ambiance. Nothing really stands out and nothing really deserves a complaint.What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.I ordered from their "little less" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a "Bear Claw" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.4.5 starsI came here for breakfast and liked it more than I expected. I had seen these places in California before but thought it was something different. My loss... until now! The inside might be lined with stuffed animals like your grandmas house or little sisters room but don't let any of that fool you. This place is solid.  So I ordered The Volcano breakfast. 3 pancakes (made with sweet cream), 2 pieces of bacon, scrambled eggs with cheese and a sausage patty. The pancakes were great and the bacon was cooked to order. The sausage is made at the restaurant and has a nice taste and my eggs were hot and good. It was a nice pile of food for $8. Our waitress was very good and even stopped to talk to us about the restaurant and some of the popular things on the menu. OH YEAH..... check out the humongous bear claws they have in the glass case as you walk in.When in Rome, eat pizza.If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  I'll call it CFS from here on out but "Chicken from Satan" might be a better acronym.It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entrée was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!Funny how "comfort food" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.Had it not been for Yelp and Philip T's recent visit, I don't know that I ever would have discovered the Black Bear Diner. I am quite certain this was my best breakfast experience in recent memory and possibly the best Chicken Fried Steak I've had in Vegas. They have knifes big enough to take down a tree, but there is no need. Tender and flaky, a fork was all I needed to tackle this breakfast feast. I went with country potatoes cooked up fresh with peppers and onions. It comes standard with a  biscuit or toast. I opted to substitute a pancake, which Candy obliged without hesitation. The pancake was so good we passed it around the table and ordered two more. They come with plenty of piping hot syrup, which is a good thing because JR drenched his pants with the first one. No need to wax this week. The over-easy eggs were cooked to perfection and the coffee was better than average. Our server, Candy, was as friendly as they come and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Great food, friendly staff and, with buddies like JR, great entertainment.This place serves a pretty good breakfast, even for being a chain. However, the service was a little reminiscent of what a normally experience at a Denny's or Cocoa's, but with better food. I ordered the Shasta Scramble which came with avocados, spinach, tomato, onion, bell pepper, and Jack Cheese all served with a housemade biscuit. I can't remember the price, but I know it was under $10.The three egg scramble was well scrambled and seasoned. I liked that they did not hold back on the avocado and vegetables, especially the spinach. The sprinkling of Jack Cheese was light, but just right, and the onions and peppers still had a slight crunchy appeal.The potatoes were simple but effective. They were cooked well with a little browning on the outside and tender inside. They could of benefited from a little extra seasoning. The biscuit was okay. It was baked to mild density and was moist. However, it's flavor was a little bland, with its spotty areas of salt. I was glad they served the biscuit with soft whipped butter. Service was okay. I felt our server was forcing a smile or perhaps she was just not a morning person. Anyways, she was friendly enough, but it just did not feel genuine. On the good side, we got served, ate good food, and had no issues, so that's all good.3.8 stars is what my gut tells me..I had been wanting to try Black Bear Diner for quite some time, the opportunity finally presented itself on Saturday afternoon, so I took advantage. I strolled in on an early Saturday afternoon, with small children and a teenager in tow. My boys immediately took a liking to all the bear decor, Black Bear Diner is truly living up to its name. The hostess immediately greeted us and we were seated right away. The bus person came out, took our drink orders and let us know the server would be with us shortly. Meanwhile we were waiting, we had plenty of time to look over the menu, by the time our server appeared, we all knew what to order. Our server was friendly but a bit stand-offish, she wouldn't make eye contact. Items Ordered:-Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich-Chocolate Cream PieOur food came out about 10 minutes after placing our order, so it came out quick! I ordered my sandwich with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. The meat was tender but it had no flavor, it was very bland. It came with a side of au jus so that made it a little bit better. They don't skimp on fries here. Everyone's plate had an abundance of fries, the seasoning they use made them taste great. Now, onto dessert, the chocolate cream pie was amazing! It was really rich and creamy, it was the best part of the meal. It came topped with a lot of whipped cream and chocolate chips, the bottom layer of the crust is chocolate. Since we came in after 11 a.m., my boys received a free sundae with their meal.Overall, I would return but next time I would try something else on the menu since I wasn't a fan of the tri-tip dip sandwich. Food is decent, service is good but our server could have been a little bit more attentive. As we were leaving, our boys were given a balloon each by the hostess, I thought that was a nice gesture for the small patrons.The food is great that is the only reason for my 1 starHowever to the POS manager DON YOU HAVE SOME NERVE!!1st off hire more staffing if you know that you are hurting with the wait time and service. (Common sense)We waited 20 mins to be seated not bad but then 45 mins to an hour more just to get our food!!! You were arrogant and rude you yelled at your poor waitress who was trying so desperately to accommodate to her full area. Everyone was upset! You them tell me nd other customers that our meal would be comped which it wasnt. Now the thing that truly upset me was our poor waitress was so upset she was crying. She was  apologizing for the service since the other waitresses were grabbing her food and she couldn't provide the service she wanted....never ever put down your staff in front of clients!!!Horrible service not because of the waitress but because of management!!!! Fire DON hire someone that knows what he is doing, maybe then he can stop comping out meals!!!!!! And make it enjoyable!!!

Review Text :
So we were looking for something different in Tempe. Well, we found it. So far the worst Italian I've had in the valley. Look at my stats. One star reviews are rare for me. I'll usually go back at least once to give them another chance. But I'll make an exception in this case, because there's no way I'm ever goin' back to this place.Should have known something was up when the waitress brought our drinks over talking on a cordless phone. "No," she said. "I can't talk right now. No. I'm working. I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks. Can I call you back? I'll call you back. Bye." When she put the phone down we ordered the eggplant parmesan. Big mistake. Looked and tasted like someone hid it at the bottom of the deep fryer and forgot about it. For 3 days. There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant. More like... cardboard. mmmm... cardboard parmesan. Seriously, it was gross. Sad thing was we were absolutely starving and on our way to a show so we ate it. Well, most of it. It came with a side of spaghetti, which was all right. Not as gross as the eggplant, but still not good.Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert. Worst canoli ever. The dough was hard and stale, and the filling was strangely sour and so thick that technically I don't think it could be classified as cream. More like... gel.Bad service, bad food. Beware.I'm sorry Carmen's but you are getting a one star review. I should have known as soon as I walked in this was not the sort of place to eat at. Should have just bellied up to the bar instead of ordering food, but we were starving. The eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extremely over fried. There we were pools of grease on the plate that they tried to mask by covering it with sauce and cheese (nice try) but you still could taste the overused deep fried oil remnants.The drinks were weak. Very weak.The canoli had the same deep fried stale taste and it was filled with cream that resembled the consistency of toothpaste.The meal was one of the worst I have had in ages. Hands down, I will not be returning.DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RESTAURANT!!!  This restaurant deserves no stars.Foolishly and uncharacteristically, I did not check Yelp because my wife said she had been here in the past and it was fine.  She obviously blotted it from her mind as a horribly traumatic experience.When we walked in, we didn't need to be seated because there was only one other couple in the restaurant, the first bad sign. The second was there was not a server in sight.  After about 5 minutes, a sever did appear from the back somewhere.  She asked for our drink order and I told her we were ready to order our dinners also, My wife ordered lasagne, which was an early bird special.  Bad sign #3.  The waitress asked her if she wanted the lunch or dinner portion (it was 6:30pm).  My wife replied that she wanted the early bird special.  The waitress grabbed the menu to examine it stating that she wasn't familiar with it because she was just here temporarily.  I ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and iced tea.Bad sign #4.  The waitress brought my iced tea. What could be wrong with iced tea? It was the foulest, most undrinkable concoction I ever attempted to drink.  When the waitress came by, I told her the iced tea was undrinkable & to bring me a Diet Coke. She came back shortly with a glass of regular Coke because they didn't carry Diet.  I said fine.  Shortly thereafter, an older man came out and said he heard that my tea wasn't good so he would bring me a fresh one.  He brought me the (fresh) one.  I didn't think it was possible, but it tasted worse than the first one.The salads came and they were OK.  They had fresh leaf lettuce, with tomato and onion, but the italian dressing tasted like Wishbone (Thank God they didn't make it themselves).Now for the entrees.  I won't go into any detail, but suffice it to say, if Taco Bell & Jack in the Box made lasagne and Chicken Cacciatore, I would eat it there before I'd set foot in this restaurant.  By the way, I haven't been to either of those places in the past 20 years.My wife and I agreed, this was the worst restaurant we have ever eaten in and I'm talking about literally thousands of restaurant meals.  I cannot fathom how this "restaurant" is still in existence.I have definitely learned my lesson.  I will never ever forget to check Yelp before I go to a new restaurant for fear that I might have blotted this nightmare out of my mind as my wife obviously did.

Dropped by this location for lunch one day.  At first glance at the sign, I thought it was an "ertos" restaurant...so I was hoping to add to my list, but alas I was wrong.  Anyway, back to the food...I ordered:Beans Rice Cheese Burrito, $3.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQ#h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQCarne Asada Taco, $2.70http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3g#G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3gCarnitas Taco, $2.70http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469w#JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQ#71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQMed Diet Coke, $1.55http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEA#pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEAWhile I was waiting for my order, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up.  I saw that they had the typical Green & Red runny, mild Salsa and some Chunky Spicy Salsa...yes!  I like spicy, so I grabbed a few cups and filled them up.  Slight problem though...the cups for the Salsa were the soft, paper like cups typically used for Ketchup & Mustard.  You're probably wondering why that's a problem?  Well, it's because when you fill it up with Salsa, it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place....yep, it was very messy.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA#g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHAThe food came out a short while later and I started with the Carne Asada Taco....it is a pretty big portion for Street Tacos.  The portion size was the only positive though....the meat was bland....and the Guacamole and Pico de Gallo that was on the Taco didn't help much.Next was the Carnitas Taco.  This one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the Carne Asada....however, it was average at best.Last but not least was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  This was very good.  Some Mexican Joints like these have oily BRC Burritos...but not here.  There was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The Tortilla was very good as well.Overall, my experience here was average...3 Stars.  If I do come back, it would be strictly for the BRC Burrito.Return Factor - 50%"Even bad Mexican food is good."  That's what I always say.  This place is pretty good actually.  I really like the tortillas-big and thin.  Reminds me of the tortillas I used to eat from a Mexican bakery when I was little.  The kind  that are so big, you can punch holes in them and wear them.  Hey, it's fun when you're 5!Anyway, I do like the food overall.  I really like the fact there's a drive-thru, so when I'm looking and feeling my worst, I don't have to worry about people thinking, "the last thing she needs is a taco plate."  Why only 3 stars you ask?  Because the meat is...well, you know how when you cut up a roast and throw out all the fatty, grisly parts.  I think they comb the streets for those parts.  But, they do make 'em taste pretty darn good.If cleanliness is next to godliness then The Betos is perched on the rim of the 6th circle of hell.That doesn't mean it's bad mexican food. In fact, it's decent enough to be a "guilty Pleasure". But you will be guilty (you will also not be constipated the next morning, ahhh, the lubricating effects of copious amounts of animal fat).I was helping my daughter buy and assemble some IKEA furniture (and I use the word "furniture" loosely in conjunction with IKEA) and she bought me lunch at The Betos (are they a family, or what?). She didn't realize that I had been here before (as I said...it's a guilty pleasure...I don't advertise things like this as a general rule). She had just found it, with her roommate, as a late night drive through dinner spot.We decided to eat at one of the picnic tables and when I got out of the truck, my first thought was "is there a rendering plant in Scottsdale"? No, but you are in the grease trap nexus that exists between Whataburger and The Betos. This is a vortex of decades old cooking grease molecules that will swirl between these 2 establishments and survive until the next ice age freezes them for our ancestors to study.My carne asada tacos were pretty decent...greasy and tasty. I got some hot sauce (can it be called "hot sauce" if it's not either thing?...just wondering...I suppose "tomato-ey water" doesn't hit the right marketing buttons). Whit had a couple of cheese enchilada's. We were full to the brim and on our way to recovering from IKEA assembly. Just what I needed to slide (pun intended) into the weekend.Any of you who read this who have ever been in love will be able to relate:There's a first pang of distress, when the knife blade pierces the skin, when you know you are in for some pain.  But the endorphins kick in and you realize that you are in for more than you ever bargained for...At los betos, after a few (5, 10, 20?) drinks, I had the sad misfortune of ordering a carnitas burrito at 220 in the am.  And what did I receive, but the most delectable delight ever served in the pinche madrugada ( rejoice, all my spanish speaking compañeros, a cuss word or two to titillate you).  The carnitas were cooked to a perfect crispy exterior, while the innards burst forth with a cornucopia of spices and flavors that made my very synapses fire indiscriminately with glee.But, not to be outdone, heartburn would make its own dastardly play for my overwhelmed nerve endings, tearing me from neck to knave with pain.  Did I stop, even for one excruciating second?  Yes, but only long enough to pour on more green sauce, villainously spicy in a way that no beto, be it fili, rol, or eri, has ever been.  Nay, I succumbed to the sweet agony of picante and used that to goad me forth into the foxhole against the onslaught of acid reflux.Each bite brought both more pain, acute, dire, and relentless, but also a sweet symphony of flavors that can only mean guacamole and green sauce replete with all the accoutrements.  I fought, and fought back hard, and what I can tell you is this:No burrito has ever caused me such pain and yet no burrito has ever granted me such pleasure.  Like a sine curve, plunging predictably from zenith to nadir and back again, los betos has given me the pleasure--nay, the honor, of feeling every physical sensation known to sentient vertebrates.Five glorious, painful, resonating stars.  Five harrowing yet riveting stars.  Five supernovas, five black holes, five big bangs of taste.  The world has never known anything like what I have just experienced.  You too can have what I had... all it takes is intestinal fortitude enough to jump in the car with a beer bong and head straight to thomas and hayden.  Oh, and leave the zantac at home, puss.I was on a mission from god (very small "g") today:) and needed a quick retox...Los Betos filled that role with...wait for it...three rolled tacos and a coke:)And yes, retoxifying, they were...chock full of greasy, cheesy, and salsa covered goodness:)My rolled tacos were very edible...and they didn't get my order wrong (more than I can say about a certain redhead's burger joint:)...but really, how can you screw up the rolled tacos?...You can't:)Just for places like this, I've created a chart with the "crap to quality ratio", in honor of Ryan C:)...(see "photo" attached...you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to attach a chart:)Although originally developed by Ryan C, in his secret lair, to asses quality  and quantity  of Boofay's, I've discovered these calculations work quite nicely for any type of greasy, divey, suspect, shady, oddball, sketchy, rough, funny smelling, bizarre, foreign, wacky, oddball, outré and outrageous eateries:)Thanks Ryan:) Bon Appetite:)...

Thank you for ruining my Saturday afternoon.It's been 15 hours since I ate here and I am just now starting to feel normal again.  I've been eating tums and chasing them with soda (to settle my stomach) as well as making several bathroom trips.  I have never been this sick from eating anywhere.  I think Taco Bell would have been far superior and they don't even serve real meat!    The chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked. My entree was the chicken burrito,  I think they use chicken in a can b/c the meat was so dry and shredded.  The waitress offered a sauce on top and good thing I accepted b/c otherwise I would have had to choke down the dry burro.  Gordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.  I think they need to pare down the menu because there are too many choices and most of it is the same crap just re-worded.  Also, I kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit.  If you don't have any tables you could be helping out in other ways.     This place really lacked warmth from the staff and I think it's important to make your customers feel welcome. I really don't see myself coming here ever again unless they make huge changes.Some colleagues and I had lunch here recently.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are served with your meal.  After browsing the menu, I went for the Cheese and Onion Enchiladas w/Rice & Beans.  The dish came out fast and on an extremely hot plate......be careful of these plates, you'll burn your hand if you touch them.After letting the food simmer down, I went for a bite of the Enchiladas....they were really good!  I poured some of the Hot Sauce that came with the Chips & Salsa on top of the Enchiladas to give them a nice kick....yum!The service here was really good and they were very friendly.  We had a great time.Return Factor - 90%I don't know how long Los Olivos has been around, but by the looks of it, it seems like a pretty long time! Old Town doesn't have many old-style Mexican food restaurants with a classic atmosphere like Los Olivos. For this reason, Los Olivos gets four stores in my book. Los Olivos reminds me of Mexican food restaurants I used to visit as a child. They have fiesta-themed decorations, plenty of decorated tile, an adobe mission style atmosphere and good food and drinks. Yes, there is better food in the Valley...much better in fact. However, Los Olivos is a good choice if you want to have a casual dinner in a festively-themed atmosphere that serve margaritas in pitchers! For food, I eat the same type of Mexican food everywhere I go, and the same goes for Los Olivos. I like their guacamole, quesadillas, chile rellenaos and chicken burritos. As for the margaritas, they are classic margaritas that go down smoothly. Again, this restaurant gets the stars mostly for a festive atmosphere and decent cuisine and cocktails to accompany it.Went to dinner with some friends, we were celebrating a friends presence , she had moved out of the valley almost 2 years ago, we were a party of 8.  This was my 1st time to Los Olivos and I was kind of excited to try them out. Unfortunately sometimes being me requires you to attend more than one party in a day, so I just came from another party where I had already filled up on some food, so I wasn't very hungry, but wanted to join my friends in the fun!I was about ten minutes late, asked the hostess were my friends were seated at, and was told, oh just look around till you find them, we have a few parties here tonight.  I thought well isn't that nice I get to roam in a place I don't know very well. But turns out I didn't have to go far, I found them in the 2nd room.I sat down, and was browsing the menu, our server came to me and said what are you drinking and looked a little perturbed that I joined this table. I just told her water. I wasn't the last one to the party, my other friend showed up 5 mins after me, and she got the same chilly attitude from the server. And with a big party like ours, it didn't really matter how bad the service was, because the tip was already added to our bill. Everyone placed there order, I wound up ordering Deep Fried Ice Cream, since I was already a meal ahead of everyone. While waiting for our food, I was munching on the chips and salsa, now I'm not a fan of the salsas, the "hotter" one was way to seedy for me. I like hot salsa, but I don't like feeing like I'm eating sunflower seeds. And the mild salsa was like a pico de gallo minus any peppers and runny. I mixed the 2 together, and that didn't really help either, so eating chips and salsa wasn't working for me.Now the deep fried ice cream that was perfect! The sweet taste of honey, the crispy outer shell and the cold ice cream made a perfect treat for this hot summer day!I really wanted to like Los Olivos, maybe I'll go to the other location and give them another try.

You all familiar with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld?I found the Burger Nazi.  I went in for my first time today. I was standing a good 10 feet from the counter, in line behind someone else, when the gruff man behind the counter shouted "What'll it be?" Now I'd never been here before so I was still sizing up the menu. It was all new to me. He put his arms out with raised palms as if to say "WTF dude?" and shouted louder and more firmly, "WHAT'LL IT BE?" I didn't want to piss the guy off any further (never piss off the people who make your food) so I just picked the burger that I happened to be looking at on the menu. He says "Ok, cheese?" I say, "Sure." He gives me the same "WTF" look and said with a sarcastic drawl, "Ok, elaborate....?" I asked him my options, he recited them to me, and I selected cheddar. But oh no, the burger Nazi couldn't leave it at that. The sarcastic drawl returned and he muttered "I thought you would have SEEN it while you were STARING AT THE MENU..."I couldn't believe I'd heard what I'd just heard so I said "Excuse me?" to give him an attempt to redeem himself. Nope. He just repeated exactly what he had said, this time even more defiantly. I almost expected him to shout, "NO BURGER FOR YOU. YOU COME BACK, ONE YEAR."A place like this can get by with HORRIBLE customer service because there is an endless stream of braindead college kids eating there because they think it's some kind of tradition. Forget it, I'm never returning. Not that Burger Nazi really cares anyways...Great Burgers and it's next to ASU in Tempe. This place is always a fun and a tasty treat. The outside is an old rusty brown building that reminds me of a hippie shack out in the woods. The smell of mesquite smoke and burgers hit you as you get out of your car. The inside is also very hip with a simple old timey feeling such as thick wooden crates for seats, barrels for trash cans and amusing tidbits hanging on the walls.Easy menu to pick from with several burger or chicken options as well as sides. You can choose from Little to Big to Great BIG as far as sizes of burgers. I always get the Great BIG one which is a 1/2 pound of juicy CHUCK with the cheese of my choice and some green chilies. They cook it right before your eyes while standing in line. I also enjoy the onion rings which are beer battled and really big and tasty. The condiment bar is very large with plenty of room to stock up on all the things you would want at a family picnic and then some. Nice.Parking is tricky being next to the campus. Bring change for the meter if you cannot get in their private lot. Also get there as early as possible to avoid the long line of HUNGRY people. CASH ONLY. Enjoy!

I thought I would give this place another try and it's still disappointing. Service was starting off very well, until I informed them of the broken piece of glass I bit inside their sticky rice. They stopped making eye contact and coming around the table. Ordered-Papaya Salad- they used bottled lemon juice which is wierd. Left a bad taste.Chicken BBQ- 4 pieces of dried up chicken and you can tell the chicken was precooked and old.Pork Rib BBQ dinner- fried rice was sweeter than usual and the ribs again was precooked, you will know by the way the bones are bone dry.Tom Ka Gai- flavor was good but the chicken was slimy so we stopped eating it. Sticky rice - typical, microwaved and the pieces of glass as a treat.So after they were told of the pieces of glass, they offered to give me a new one. Which I refused and then they just disappeared. They did remove $2 off my bill.

This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.It's a ritual.  In February, hoards of people flock to Phoenix to escape the chill, play golf, watch spring training, and go to Don and Charlie's.Don and Charlie's is an institution around this area, especially during February and March.  Dine here and more than likely you'll see a big league player, manager, scout, etc.  Tonight there were some Milwaukee Brewers dining with us.This place is covered with so much sports memorabilia, you feel like you're dining in a museum.  I think the memorabilia is worth more than the restaurant, and it's definitely worth more than the food.  Expect a long wait if you come at prime time, as this place does get busy.Food - your typical upscale ribs, steak, and prime rib place.  Good but not great; the memorabilia is the main attraction here and is worthy of four stars.Do you like meat? Feel like checking out the most legendary restaurant known to the spring training crowd? You've found it. Don and Charlies was a part of my growing up. Beginning in a booster seat and now as an adult, I've spent many nights enjoying the food and atmosphere at Don and Charlie's. When you walk in, the walls are stocked with pictures of those who've visited over the years as well as some classic memorabilia. The low ceilings give it the feeling of a members-only club. It's Old Arizona to the tee and on most nights, it'll have a wait list out the door of the old timers. I love it here. It could be the memories, the great All-American food, the fact that I had my first date here with my now fiance, the pitchers of diet coke they provide or just the vibrant environment and character...but whatever it is, I'm happy every time I walk inside. Like I said, it's solid All-American cookin' like BBQ chicken, great tender beef or pork ribs that fall right off the bone, awesome steaks, mouthwatering au gratin potatoes and the list goes on and on. Start with a Cesar salad, order their famous BBQ ribs for dinner, accompany it with Au Gratin potatoes and finish the meal with a Goldbrick Sundae. Whether you're in town for spring training or you're just up for a going out to dinner, I suggest giving Don and Charlie's a try. This place shouldn't be just an old timer hot spot. I am no old timer and I still enjoy my visits.WHATS WITH THE CONSTANT ........... Raising the menu prices ?????If the practice of "Comping" athletes and a particular Elite Group (see link)ended, you'd be ABLE TO LOWER PRICES.http://www.yelp.com/biz/championship-dining-experience-for-elites-at-don-and-charlies-scottsdaleHave you lost sight of the fact ........ that this will PISS customers off ?Recent diners will, pass this info along ....... to Family & Friends'.Will I, still eat at D & C ......... YES, when I have a coupon or Groupon,as I did this Evening ......otherwise NEVER !! Its obvious  business must be suffering ...... has you're doing Groupon, quite often.This is always an indication, that an established restaurant, is experiencing a decline in revenue (probably due to frequent price increases).Folks' wait for a $40 Groupon coupon (purchased for $20).$24.95 for a full slab of Baby Back Ribs, last night .... is ABSURD.         You just raised the PRICE AGAIN .....use to be $22.95There was available seating the entire Evening .... HMMMM, wonder why ??P.S.    5 years ago, the Baby Back Ribs were OUTSTANDING.               Through the past 5 years, they've slipped each year.                     It's time to clean up the appearance, both inside & out.                            How much further, are you going to go, before a Rehab ????           ***Remember "Comping", doesn't improve the bottom-line,  UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE IS PAYING FOR IT.***Was excited to try this place since I saw from their website that it had tons of sports memorobilia, and that the owner was from Chicago (where we are from).  And, it was within walking distance too.Walked over there for dinner - it was, of course, ridiculously crowded.  Problem #1 - the hostess was completely clueless and overwhelmed.  We asked how long the wait would be, she said she was unsure.  We asked if we could put our name in, she again said she didn't know.  In the meantime, they're calling other parties names for seating, so we ask again.  The hostess gets a confused look on her face and ignores us.  So.... we just sat ourselves in the bar dining area. Fifteen minutes later, a server decides to come over and ask us if we'd been helped.  She takes our drink order.  Two other servers come by and ask if we would like to order drinks, and we tell them we'd already had our drink order taken.  Throughout the course of our meal, I think four servers served us.  No clue who our actual server was.  I think this was in part because there was an ASU sports group (head coach?) in the restaurant sitting a few tables over.  It was amusing to watch the cheeseball of an owner spend the whole evening name-dropping and schmoozing with them.  Too bad it was at the expense of the other customers.  The food we ordered was actually good.  Kind of surprised that the burgers didn't come with fries, especially for over $10.  After we were done eating, it literally took almost a half hour for us to get our bill.  One of our four servers actually caught on and brought a bill and apologized for the sketchy service, but assumed we understood since the table behind us was "more important.  It is the new ASU head coach, you know."  We admired the memorobila collection as we walked out, listened to the owner do some more name-dropping about how he knew Bud Selig in the lobby, and left.  Despite the good food and impressive sports collection, we probably won't be back.  Too bad - was hoping for better.*************Their Newest RIP-OFF*************               *******Remember the FREE Chopped Liver Plate*********                       ------------------IT'S NOW $4.95----------------"Our Famous Chopped Liver Platter, sweet bell pepper strips, carrot slaw, diced onions and chopped egg................4.95"Whats next ?????? ...........Bread Basket For $4.95I've got about $50 bucks........left on a giftcard.........and then Don .........its ADIOS........The old D&C will be missed.The Owners business sense ....... is in bad shape ......same as the parking lot.Don ........ you've got a lot of Chutzpah......and its not good.This is my 3rd review for D & C .........see the other two belowI'm giving Don & Charlies 5 stars because it is an all around solid steakhouse. Everything I've tried here has been really good, from the shrimp cocktail, to their salads, and of course their big, juicy, tender steaks. But it isn't just good food, management,  servers, and even their valet guys understand what good service is. The owner/managing partner I  met was super sweet, and seemed very down to earth, in fact this whole restaurant is very cool and unpretentious. The prices are not low, but well worth a splurge. Well done Don & Charlies!

Am I stuck in some weird dream?Are we really at a table in the aisle of a wine store with a shopping cart seated at the head of the table? (yes, see photo)(***UPDATE*** Yelp decided ALMOST 2 YEARS LATER that my photo of THE INSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT was "specific to my experience" and therefore "not appropriate for the general business listing"...Yelp is too funny...)Did the store clerk really just tell me to not get my good trusted bottles of wine and instead suggest three of the most putrid wines I've ever had?Does the menu really have the phrase "in season" in quotes, as if the food isn't really in season but they are pretending it is?Are there really people in this "restaurant" (see the use of quotes there?) loudly cheering for the Iowa Warhawks game?Was I really just served cold duck confit?Am I really eating it?Did they really just charge me $10/bottle corkage fee on wine I paid for at the cash register 5 feet away?Did I really just wait 20 minutes for someone to take my credit card?2 stars because *overall* the food was good (even if my duck was cold).

Otto's daughters are fucking hot. I'm a straight lady and they may or may not be of age. But those girls are cuuuuute. Sometimes they dance to '80s and indie pop mix tapes in the back, too. So, you know, if that's your thing, that's gotta be worth at least a star. Oh, what, you wanted to know about the pizza? It's fucking delicious. It's all thin-crusted and fresh and crispy. For by-the-slice, it blows Slices out of the water. It's also simple -- no Oregano's BS toppings (for the record, I like Oregano's pizza, too. But sometimes you don't want no rosemary-potato-goat cheese concoction; you just want pepperoni and some red pepper flakes).The calzones and pizza rolls are enormous and full of warm goodness.Their soda comes with crushed ice. Fuck you if you don't know why that's awesome. With girls that cute and pizza that good, Otto better watch out.

Review Text :
I've been back to this Pita Jungle quite a few times. Service has gotten considerably better and for that, I'm thankful. However, they still fail when it comes to putting out consistent food. I don't understand why this keeps happening. It's unfortunate because Pita Jungle is SO GOOD when it's consistent, and I really want to go here all the time, but when food comes out different every time I can't spend my money here.I thought I had a good thing going when I went on a Friday and Saturday evening. The service was excellent & the food was totally fantastic - 5 stars. Alas, these experiences tricked me into believing they had improved so I came back on a weekday during a non peak time. I ordered the same thing I did over the weekend- a chicken shwarma wrap. This time it was perfect too! I thought to myself, "Thank god, now I can start coming back here regularly." So I came back on another weekday, same time, and the chicken shwarma was all wrong. Here's what was wrong:Not enough lettuceNot enough vegetablesNot enough garlic sauceNot enough tahiniThe wrap was this little measly thing with about half the amount of dressings and veggies as when I got it the last few times. Wtf? I seriously thought I was going crazy so I came back the following week and ordered the same thing, thinking maybe it was just an off day. Nope. The same thing happened- except this time it has even less tahini and sauce. Seriously, these shwarma's don't taste half as good without a fair amount of garlic sauce and tahini. When I got it the first few times, every bite had sauce. This time, I could barely even taste it. So at this point, I asked my waiter for extra sauces and when I got the bill I found out he charged me! The thing that sucked is I didn't look at the receipt until after he swiped my card. Otherwise I would have mentioned it.I guess I should have complained to him straight up that the pita wrap tasted like crap, then maybe he wouldn't have charged me. It was still really annoying. Both those things were $0.75 each! I was not happy!I'm giving this place an extra star because the servers have finally become attentive and now I know never to come on a weekday and only on the weekends!Using their Online Ordering system is a COMPLETE waste of time. Both times we used it we ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for them to finish our food even though we ordered over an hour in advance.Both times there have been problems with the orders even though everything is in written form in front of their faces.Today, instead of individually wrapping our pitas, they gave us a bag of store bought pita bread. How tacky.When you call to make a complaint about it taking an unreasonable amount of time, and when your orders are incorrect, they treat you with a horrible attitude as if YOU did something wrong. If you make a mistake, at very least own up to it. And the food is overall pretty bland, just like all other Pita Jungle's.We will not be ordering from Pita Jungle again.I have to say this place is good. I am not a person who likes to try anything different. I like what I like and that is it. I do not like to eat dinner food for Breakfast like my girlfriend does. HeeheeSeriously, she will eat eggs for dinner and pasta with gravey for Breakfast.Anyway, pita Bread or Wrap it is a hard choice as they are both really good.The portions of food are huge. Almost too much, but hey I am not complaining.I like my sandwhiches with Garlic,not tahini.Chicken is really good and I do not normally go for chicken.Every thing seems to be really fresh I must say and the salads are great.Do you ever just crave jalapeno & cilantro hummus? No? Well I do, and still recently new in my area of town so unfamiliar to all that is in my surroundings, so I checked the Yelp app for hummus and Pita Jungle showed up, and get this it's within 3 miles of my place, so this was a win win for me!I knew what I wanted so I called my order in, I got a small side of jalapeno cilantro hummus with cucumbers and a chicken shawarma pita with garlic potatoes was told my order would be ready for pick up in 10 to 15 minutes.  Arrived at Pita Jungle, and have to say I like the setup of this place, and it seems to me that maybe each Pita Jungle is set up a little differently, which is cool, I like variety. Even the small hummus is enough to share between 2 people and the side of cucumber looked like it was maybe a whole cucumber and this side was delish, just what I was craving. The garlic potatoes are always a favorite with me at Pita Jungle but the chicken shawarma wasn't that great, I couldn't place my finger on but something was off so I didn't finish that. I can't really attest to service since I was a pick up only, but I was greeted by the hostess when I entered and showed were to get my order. Glad to have found Pita Jungle in my area, I'm sure I will be back.

Review Text :
umm yea. there is nothing all that great about the Rulai was here with my BFF (yea like a teenage girl, lol) cause we was bored and figured get out of the spot.we took the train up to mill already half toasted on a couple cans of Mickies in thirstbuster cups care of Circle K. (heart) circle K kay..! ya know.anyways so walked up and down mill scoffing at the people looking to get fucked up. i blew up AmyD on the cell saying we would catch up with her at the sets or yucca tap room...ended up walking back to the Rula and grabbed a couple drinks. umm. yea. this place isn't really great or anything.  just kinda like all the rest of the "bars" on mill. just irish stylized. i've been here plenty of times before and never thought to myself..."wow what a great irish bar". meh. it's kinda like a themed college bar and nothing more. oh well. grabbed a couple blue moons and bizounced. threw a middle finger to mill as we jumped on the "trolly" and busted ass back to PHX screaming "602"I have worked on Mill for over a decade and Rula Bula has stood the test of time in my restaurant rotation. Last Friday I went for happy hour, and yesterday for lunch. Both expierinces were so pleasant I thought it high time to yelp it. Happy hour was great. Our bartender was attentive and funny and made sure to come around before last call. They have some great apps on special, chicken fingers, skewers, potato skins ect. Their lunch menu features weekly specials, so there is always some thing new and different to try. I went there with a group of 5 ladies and we everyone was happy with their choice. I had the grilled cheese on marble rye (with tomato and 4 types of cheese this sandwich is delicious), I have tried the boxtys, potato pies, bangers and mash, french dip and salmon - all great. Our dining experience was enjoyable last week mainly do to our server (Nathan?). He split our bill without being asked and had boxes and change before we finished eating. When you're on a lunch break, not having to wait around at the end of your meal is a big plus. Rula Bula has a great outdoor patio, fun pub atmosphere, excellent Irish pub food and is located right off the Light Rail.  You can't go wrong.Since everyday is a good day for a Guinness, and since I happen to be on Mill every single day, this is the spot I like to come to collaborate those 2 facts of life. I also really love that I get free drinks, often, but I think its just the red hair. Seriously, red heads in Irish pubs.. I could tell stories for days..Its not exactly your model Irish pub, but they have a decent happy hour, yummy menu options, lots of space and a sweet patio with an outdoor bar. The only real downfall here is the douchey dudes that are always here and that it is always retardedly packed after 8pm. Otherwise, its all good. Seriously subtract that and add a mechanical Bull or something equally obnoxious, and I'm a fan for life.Over the last year, I've noticed a rapid decline in the quality of service at Rula Bula. It used to be my favorite place to wash away my college woes, but now I don't ever want to go back.On a Friday night in May I was out celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of 10-12 people. We were all ordering food, booze and overall having an excellent time. When time comes to mosey on home, the waitress informs me that my credit card has been lost. Problem #1: If a guest's credit card is lost, a manager should always come discuss this with the guest, not the server.The waitress, Maddie, was horrified and worried, and suggested I leave my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me. She also gave me a comped beer, which I later found out wasn't comped but a beer she paid for herself. True true to her word I received a phone call shortly after close that night. For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was "left overnight".Problem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.There's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology. The managers really don't seem to care, which is an attitude that rubs off on many of the employees, save for Maddie. I'm sad to say goodbye to the best Guinness in town, but I simply can't keep justifying the poor service and lack of concern for customer satisfaction.We came in here for an Early dinner one day. For once I did not have a hard time finding a parking spot.  Beautifully decorated place inside. Very much like a place in Ireland. Just a lot cleaner, because, it is newer.Even down to the Lace curtains. The food was good, really good. Very true to Irish Food. Not something that everyone likes. But, since I grew up with the Ish food. I like it.Our service was good, Everything was hot (food) which is another plus. They do offer Free wifi, which I did not use, but if you needed it.......After dinner we sat outside on the enclosed patio area. To listen to live music which was also nice. They allow smoking on the patio. If you are into that.I would absolutely go back to eat again."The mouth of a perfectly happy man is filled with beer." ― Egyptian Proverb. Does this quote apply to those who drink Snake Bites?  Anywho!  Met up with some of my favorite Yelpers for a belated St. Paddy's Day lunch and it was great!  Rula Bula's is a cute little pub with fun Irish tunes and some delicious eats.  Their patio was looking pretty tempting on this beautiful Friday and the first day of Spring but we dined indoors.To start things off, Gillian ordered and shared her Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls with us.  Thanks for sharing those heavy balls with us, girly!  I had assumed that the spice would be present inside the deep-fried cheesy potato balls but the spice came from the hot sauce served on the side.  It was kind of nice since weaklings like me can adjust accordingly.  I had a picture but I stupidly deleted it before I posted it.  Gah!  As for my entree, I ordered the Shepherd's Pie with my side of brussel sprouts with apples.  It was delicious, buttery, and worth the calories.  Brett said he can taste Guinness in the sauce but since I was washing my food down with a Guinness Snake Bite, I can't really confirm it but it was darn delicious!  The brussel sprouts were cooked to tender perfection and I loved the bite from the apples.  I actually didn't know the brussel sprouts came with apples until I bit into one.  Yum!  That tartness really helped cut through all that richness from the potatoes and meat.  I would definitely order this again!"For each petal on the shamrock this brings a wish your way. Good health, good luck, and happiness for today and every day."  Thanks for a great lunch!Came out for lunch and looks as though the fried fish were their signature dishes or the typical bar food.  They have Guinness on tap, enough said!  They have a huge patio at the back and full bar.

Restaurant name  Tott's Asian Diner

Review Text :
Before Christmas my son and his girl friend came up from Tucson for a visit and to exchange baked goodies.  She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here.Yeah!  Kickass Asian fast food!No "bobo plates", no little sterno grill to burn your own food, no 70s "Oriental" restaurant ambiance.  This is the REAL THING.  Just knock your socks off, FRESH Asian cuisine to please many palates.  Want veggie?  There's LOTS of vegetarian options for you made to order and brought to your table fast.  Chinese?  Sure.  Japanese?  That too.  They even have pho and curry plates.  You'll get a satisfying mound of food for $10 including bottomless drink.  My only caveat: don't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with--this place is LOUD.  That's okay--you'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much.Look, I'm from the SF Bay Area, where Asian joints abound.  This place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the Bay.  Best Asian spot so far that I've been to in the Valley.  If there's a better one, I have yet to find it.Go.  Eat.  Stuff thyself.There are a few times I wish I could give more than 5 stars, and this is one of them.  I can't believe I waited so long to give Tott's a try.  Just a little background on my experience with Chinese food.  My mother was not a great cook and the only time we had anything even remotely resembling Chinese food was when she would crack open a can of that LaChoy Chow Mein.  It.  Was.  Awful.I had to wait until I was in college to get some good Chinese food and a friend took me to Yen Ching's in Waterloo, IA and set me up with sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  Ever since then I've had a serious love affair with mongolian beef, and I'll get sweet and sour chicken if a restaurant does it up with the peppers, onions, and pineapple.  I've discovered over the years that very few places do that any more.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their pictures, I can see that Tott's does it correctly.Right away I was greeted by the employees, and the dude who took my order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered my lunch to dine in, and then an order of pork lo mein to go, to take home for my husband.  The restaurant isn't very big, but it's organized well and very clean.  My order of cheese puffs was so nice and light and the sweet & sour chicken was perfect.  I loved that the owner came around and introduced himself and when I told him I like how they prepared my lunch he said, "Isn't that the way everyone does it?"  Nope.  Absolutely not.  The chicken was lightly breaded and fried and the flavors with the sweet & sour sauce and peppers, onions, and pineapple were delicious.  It tasted like they use a good quality sweet & sour sauce too.  Usually the sauces at most places are very syrupy and sugary, almost like someone did a Red Bull reduction, and I usually get heartburn after eating them.  Not in this case.  The sauce was nicely balanced and so far no heartburn.With the cheese puffs, a fountain soda, the sweet & sour chicken, and the lo mein my total was $20.27 before tax & tip.  Excellent experience all around.  This is food and customer service as good as it gets for sure!  Can't wait to go back!

Review Text :
Had our service been anything better than pathetically bad, Buca would be a solid 3 stars.  So here's the deal on the service.  I got a coupon in the mail for a free spaghetti with marinara.  That's what brought us in.  But we also ordered two appetizers and an entree to start with.  I commented that I thought the coupon was a nice idea to bring people in (give away a little spaghetti but sell twice that in other menu items).  His response was "yeah, if people are like you and order other stuff, but if they just order spaghetti and water... (insert monotone robotic voice)."  Well, okay then, he should be grateful we didn't do that.Everything we ordered was terribly slow to come.  Kitchen's fault?  Maybe, but we notice where the other servers on the patio are coming and going, our server is rarely seen and when he is around, he's dragging his feet appearing to be on his way to the gas chamber.  Other than taking and delivering our order, he did nothing for us.  While not rude, he was not pleasant or overly friendly either.  The other guys on the patio helped us out with drink refills, clearing plates, etc.  After a long wait at the end of the meal, he returned remarking someone else was supposed to be helping.  We ordered dessert to go, another terrible wait, and asked our food be boxed.  Finally, he brings the dessert and realizes he never brought the leftovers.  Off he shuffles.  Upon returning, he says he's sorry about the wait.  Not half as sorry as he would be upon seeing his tip I'm sure.As for the food, it's good, but nothing outstanding.  Even for family style plates, I think it's slightly overpriced.  When they say a small serves 2-3, that's 2-3 lunch sized portions.  If you're a "healthy" eater, count on 2.  Here's what we ordered:Small garlic bread.  Really good bread slathered in fresh garlic, but $7.99.  Yes, it's a good sized basket, but it's still just garlic bread.  Perhaps bread should be offered at no charge.  Small mozzarella caprese.  Five nice thick slices of tomato with good quality cheese and whole basil leaves.  $9.99 but worth it.Small spaghetti with marinara, normally $9.99 but free.  I would say this serves two for a main dish, three as a side.  Marinara was okay, nothing special.Small chicken parmigiana.  Tasty but overpriced at $17.99 for two breasts IMO.  Remember it does not come with any pasta, just the chicken.Tiramisu.  Best value at $9.95.  It's the size of a small pie and could easily serve four, but I didn't think it was fantastic.  It's a little too "wet," like you could squeeze the cake and get a cup of coffee out of it.We wanted to have a after-lunch drink, but the service turned us off to that.  Might come back, might not.

Still reliably "decent."  Food is just okay in my book.  I don't care for either the red or the green chile or their supposedly "award-winning" tamales, but I am a fan of the tijuana tacos and their guacamole tostadas, the latter mostly because they heap on a ton of guac and I can convince myself they are "heart healthy" and eat it all guilt-free.Pretty bad service tonight for the last half of our meal, but I can't blame the server.  Somehow he got stuck with a table of 8-10, all straggling in separately and indecisive, plus two other tables arriving at the same time.  I actually saw our server running through the restaurant, and I mean running.  Yet, we saw plenty of other employees virtually comatose.  Nice teamwork there.  On the plus side,  my husband was lucky enough to catch a glimpse of Arizona's next parent of the year digging the fruit out of her cocktail and feeding it to her baby.  At least give the baby her own drink.  Geez!Julio G's resides at the very bottom of the barrel when it comes to Mexican food in the valley. From the outside the bright and vividly colored building might make you think that it's some tasty independently owned hole in the wall, but don't fall for the mirage... you're walking into a dungeon of greasy food and bad service. It took about five minutes to completely be turned off by this place. We sat down and were greeted by what had to be one of the most disinterested waitresses I've ever had. She had this vibe going that made us feel like we were inconveniencing her just by being there... her non-descript facial expression and attitude were overshadowed only by her terrible service; which could best be described as 'going through the motions' (even that is giving her too much credit though). Opening the menu yielded even more dissatisfaction... the menu itself was drab and gimmicky and was full of unflattering pictures of the food; making it feel like a chore to even pick out something that looked appetizing. One thing I noticed immediately that should have been a red flag was that for all of their chicken dishes, they charged about three dollars extra for white meat... that's never a good sign. We eventually settled on a chorizo breakfast quesadilla and their sampler platter which included one of just about everything on the menu. The breakfast quesadilla was massive... it must've weighed about three pounds, the taste was okay but it was dripping with grease and after just a few bites it was hard to stomach any more of it. Our other dish; the sampler platter could best be described as a plate of hot garbage. The assortment of food was thrown on the plate and absolutely smothered with cheese... way too much cheese; in fact the plate itself was literally swimming in cheese which almost seemed to be liquefied... more than likely just an artery clogging mixture of melted cheese and grease. The meal was such a grease bomb that we probably ate about 20 percent of it, yet we felt like our stomachs were going to explode when we were done. There is that nice full feeling you get after you eat a well made meal at a good restaurant, then there is that feeling you get after you eat something like Julio G's; that feeling can best be described as 'Where's the toilet?'. To wrap up the lovely meal, the waitress messed up the bill and charged us for both of our drinks even though one of them should have came free with our breakfast quesadilla. At that point though, it was a mute point and we didn't have the energy or patience to try and explain what had happened to her, at risk of causing her brain to short circuit. This is a place I can firmly say I won't be returning to under any circumstance. Julio G's is a poster child for everything a restaurant should NOT be. Bland and boring greasy food, huge portions but zero quality, and a wait staff that you'd swear just woke up from a long nap. To top it all off, the prices are a tad steep for a Mexican restaurant... so basically there's no reason at all to ever try this place. You've been warned... bleh.

This is one of my favorite Mom and Pop hole in the wall places in Tempe. Some friends told me about this joint and so I decided to come by and see what was smoking. Nice!Very simple inside with some booths to sit at and a counter to order your food. Their menu offers Mesquite Grilled Chicken and some delicious Carne Asada Beef. They also have several yummy sides that you can order as well.There are no fancy this or that items here like some other restaurants. Just very tasty food that is cooked with tender love and care. You can see it in the customer's faces as they arrive for a repeat visit.Usually order the Combo Plate with a side of Beans and several Jalapenos to get my juices flowing. They make the Salsa in house and it combines nicely with the warm tortillas and the beef and chicken. Saw several people buying whole and half chickens and getting them to go.Place can get pretty busy during peak lunch time hours and it is very close to the ASU campus. You may even see some short shorts during your visit. Or what they called hot pants now? GO SUN DEVILS!4 STARS

Looking for a quick bite on this side of town, Jackson's Bar & Grill came up in my search.  Walking through the bar, the dining area is in the back with day time soaps taking over the television.The Husband ordered their Jack Daniels Tri-Tip Sandwich ($9.99) and it came with your choice of french fries, cole slaw, cup of soup, or side salad.  He opted for the french fries.  He thought the sandwich was pretty tasty and he was happy with his choice.I went for their Chicken Fingers ($6.49), which you can choose how you would like them.  I went for spicy, hoping for some much needed kick.  Unfortunately, it looked like it would be spicy but it definitely was not.  It was more on the mild side of things.  The four fingers came with carrot and celery sticks and their homemade ranch dressing.  It was just average, nothing special.  It looks like the thing to get here is their $6.99 Steak Special though.  "A 9 oz steak, choice of fries, slaw, or rings, steamed veggies and a dinner salad, all for ONLY $6.99, 24 hours a day. Groups are welcome."  All that for $6.99 and served all day sounds like a pretty good deal to me! They also still accept the Entertainment Book coupon!$6.99 steak dinner special means I don't have to schlep it to Ellis Island if I want a cheap steak fix..which I haven't had in 2 years but still...I got a $20 match play coupon in the mail for my birthday here and they offer $10 match play coupons on the back of the Flamingo and Decatur Smith's supermarket reciepts.  So my wife and I go and the bartender just puts a $20 in my machine..lets my wife use 2 coupons so she has $20 in free play now.  I also had a buy one get one free entree coupon to top it all off.My wife orders the cheeseburger which was just ok but I get the steak dinner which is a pretty sweet deal for all the stuff you get.  This is quality late night drunken food for sure!!  7 drinks later, I end up hitting quad aces and quad 5's in back to back hands and my wife hits a ten high diamond straight flush on her machine!!  First time either of us had ever hit those high hands in our limited video poker experience.Drinks were comped for our play, dinner comes out to $9 and we cash out for $100.  Pretty fn great!!!After a great dinner with the "family", we walked a few doors down to have a few drinks at Jackson's. It seems like the past few months of my life have been tolerable thanks to alcohol...and I'm not a drinker.This is a locals Green Bay Packers bar. So, I was a little confused why there aren't any cheesehead decor in the bar but there was a harpoon of all things. This place is pretty big.The women's restroom is quite disgusting. Only 2 stalls: regular and handicap. The regular one was filthy and I had to use 3 toilet seat covers to relieve myself and the flush didn't work! The other times I went to the bathroom, I had to use the handicap stall which was much better and cleaner.BUUUUUT our server was fantastic. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink so she let me try stuff and she was accurate with the description of flavor profiles of drinks. She would chat with us from time to time. However, we found it quite peculiar when she asked me if I wanted a cold glass. I want a volcanic glass that would spew hot beer please! She's still good in my book though. Magic Hat #9 and Stella Artois FTW!Ok so I have fallen in love with Jackson's bar & grill on Flamingo and Jones for many great reasons!Why you say...? Well it is easy to love because first of all the Service is Amazing, and that means a lot to Yelpers like myself. There are way too many spots to visit in LV so why would we go where the service is bad? Exactly and that is why I am now a loyal and now semi regular patron of Jackson's.The food is another reason I visit because they have a menu that is one of the best in town for a bar and grill. This last visit I had ordered the mild chicken strips appetizer because I had remembered how good it was the last time I went!I also decided on the Jalapeno poppers to split with a friend and what a great choice that was! These were filled with cream cheese and had the best batter on them, possibly like panko fried to a golden brown! This dish also comes with a delicious sweet chili sauce which was a nice addition to the already growing mouth orgasm I was in the middle of.I will have to try their prime rib special sometime because every time I go I am informed by other customer's that they have a very very very good prime rib din din!I will have to try it because if I recall a customer who was sitting next to made me promise her I would try it next time lol.  I can't go back on a promise, so...lolOk so now that I have confirmed that the service and food is truly fabulous. Let's get to the Bar which is why we come in the first place for a nice drinky drink...right? BARTENDER BILLY IS THE BEST!I go on Thursday nights to meet my friends at midnight because we get to see Billy who is the most Awesome bartender around. His drinks are yummy, he has a fantastic personality and his bar skills and great attitude can't be beat!I have stopped by the last three Thursdays in a row, I am slowly becoming a regular and who do I have to thank for that...Billy lol.Jackson's is Awesome and if I could kiss the Owners I would because they knocked this one out of the ball park!Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sautéed onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!Mmmm yum yes I say as always! Jackson's is the go to spot for an Amazing Bartender, great food and overall fun!They have my favorite game, Cleopatra Keno which is fun to play while enjoying the night!My friends and I always hit up Jackson's at midnight when the best bartender (Billy) in all of Las Vegas starts his shift. The food is Amazing, I could close my eyes and just point at the menu and know that whatever it is will be delicious!I am a forever loyal fan.Come on down and see what all of the fuss is about! :)It says it's been 19 days since I wrote my last review. That's the longest I've done that in a while.  Let's see if I still know how to do this.Ah Jackson's Bar and Grill. I've always known of Jackson's, pass it all the time but never went. It's your typical neighborhood bar/restaurant. The food ain't fancy or amazing but it's good for what it is.  This is a Packers bar so when it's the NFL season you know what's up. Solid 3.25 stars.I had a serious craving for a steak and remembered Roger T. talking about the 16 oz rib eye deal here. Well after I got here I was hit by a dilemma, it was a Monday and there was also a 16 oz prime rib deal. Hmm do I have the 16 oz prime rib for $11.99 or the 16 oz rib eye for $12.99 how about both!?I already had my mind set on the rib eye before coming here so I had to get it. For the price the rib eye wasn't that bad. I ordered a medium well and got more well done but I had no complaints there other then it being a little tough. I still ate it. It still taste good enough to get again. It came with some brussel sprouts and a baked potato, which were both kind of meh. It's a pretty good deal for a steak meal offered 24/7. I also ordered a lobster bisque soup, kinda too salty but edible. Another Monday I was craving steak again and said PRIME RIB. It was OK again kind of overcooked and dry had to really use the au jus for it but it satisfied my craving for meat that day. They actually ran out and I  had gotten the last one, it was barely 5:30pm on prime rib special night. Prime rib is offered pretty much everywhere in town. I wouldn't say I was a fan of the prime rib but I'd eat it again maybe ask for it more rare.The rest of menu ain't that bad. There's more meat dishes, it has "Grill" in it's name, sandwiches, burgers, breakfast, etc. What stands out besides the 16 oz prime rib and 16 oz rib eye has to also be the 20 oz ham and eggs for $9.99, the 1 lbs rib eye and eggs, and whatever they had on the 24/7 menu, which I may come back for. The staff is friendly but they seemed understaffed.  It's been pretty busy both times I was there. There's a bar area which can hold decent number of people, a separate restaurant area which can hold more people, and another area away from the bar where there's a 82 inch TV and a comfortable chair right in front which I fell asleep in after eating two 16 oz meals each time I was here. Real chill place with a pretty good 2 pitchers of PBR for $10 deal offered 24/7.Roger we should watch the first game of the season here Packers vs Seahawks haha.I have been coming to Jackson's Bar & Grill for some time...maybe 4 years now.  I used to be a semi regular on Tuesday nights (Backgammon Tournament) but haven't been impressed with the service or food.  I have been postponing doing a review hoping it would return to what I remembered from years ago...but alas it has not.My most recent visit was a Monday night for the prime rib.  The portions are very generous, but the food quality is just good at best.  The prime rib was ordered medium, but originally served raw, not rare but RAW.  My friend who prefers it rare even commented that it was too rare for even HIM.  Two trips back to the kitchen later the prime rib had at least stopped mooing and I decided to just keep it.  The mash potatoes and gravy was served separately and now cold as the beer.  Now... beer was good and cold so that is a plus!The dining area is somewhat separated from the bar area, but the smoke definitely makes its way back to the dining area.  I wish I would have at least posted a review with 3 Stars prior, but now I have to go with just 2 Stars and I seriously doubt I will be back to try it again, but you never know.I have been to Jackson's many of times, I would consider myself a semi regular and a big fan of bartender Billy!I stopped by for an early morning visit to have breakfast and play some Cleopatra keno.A new cook has joined the Jackson's family and his name is Dave! He prepared my breakfast this morning and it was delicious! I ordered one of their breakfast plates, eggs (scrambled) hashed browns and sourdough toast. ($5.29) Wow, I must say this was one of the best breakfast meals I have had dining out in a long while. My eggs were cooked perfectly, hashed browns nice and golden, and the best sourdough bread ever toasted to perfection! Their breads are tasty, wow, I don't recall a time when I have enjoyed sourdough toast as much as I did this morning!I have to give a butt bump and a high five to Dave for making an awesome breakfast! I am happy that he is a part of their team because from what I have tasted he can throw down in the kitchen!I love Jackson's, you Rock!

This place is Amazing!!! *** I LOVE THEIR SANDWICHES THUS FAR!!!! "The Michelangelo "  was one of the the most incredible sandwiches that I have had in my life!!! I wish I could remember everything that it had, but that doesn't matter because you should try them out yourself!!! This place is great!!! Truly Great!!! YUM, YUM!!! :)_ Okay let me be super honest, I feel the need to express my most sincere thoughts about this place. If I could give them a ZERO star review I would!   I really liked this place before, the service used to be good, just chill natural treatment, the hidden/sneaky location, and let's not forget the vibe and the out of the ordinary sandwiches they offer, yet tasty.   However my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely. I do not plan on ever visiting this sandwich location again, maybe a different spot with a better care for customer satisfaction, but definitely not this location.  On my visit here, it was about 10:30 a.m., with no traffic, at least not as busy as normal peak hours for breakfast/lunch.   Yet, they managed to take 15+ minutes to prepare a sandwich. I would like to add that by the looks as when I came into this establishment they had a full kitchen staff, as well as helping staff at the registers. Still they managed to take that long to make my sandwich, and I honestly think that they forgot my order, but they failed to recognize that, I asked the girl at the register, who by the way was insanely rude If she still had my order for, "The Perfect Storm" which was their special hot sandwich for the day, she said yes, but first asked me again for my name, as well as to remind her what I had ordered.    I then figured that she had forgotten my order, and I believe they did because the people behind me and those behind them after my order were getting called for their sandwiches and I was still there waiting.    I don't understand why they feel like they can take all the time they please to make a sandwich and then not even give a simple apology recognizing their mistake.  That apology would have made it much better, word of advice, just show a little more consideration next time please.   I was in no big rush, yet I could be doing better things with my time other than checking back on my sandwich order to make sure they didn't forget it. Then after all that mess the sandwich was not what  I expected it to be, way too much cheese and oil. Sorry not my style nor taste. The board clearly advertised a Grilled Turkey, Melted Swiss Cheese, Sautéed Mushrooms & Red Bell Pepper, Tomato, Romaine Lettuce, Honey Mustard, and On a Toasted Baguette. Sounds tasty and healthy right, not the case for this baguette.* TOTAL Dissatisfaction *Terrible service by the girl at the register *Not up to par sandwich -Good reasons why to never ever come back. - Oh and terrible tea!!

I wasn't quite sure what to make of this place...The food was fine, but it was the people...THE PEOPLE!As a girl gamer who keeps her inner geek firmly behind closed doors (until now!), I didn't know what to make of the table full of guys were dining there prior to their WoW (World of Warcraft) raid."Hurry up, man. We have to leave. Raid starts in forty five mins.""Chill, dude. We're only around the corner from the house.""My internet and wifi connection might have to be re-booted.""My hunter needs blah blah blah..."I tuned out and decided to focus on my food and surroundings. The restaurant itself is a bit rundown, but the tables and chairs were clean, even if the napkin dispenser on the table wasn't. I didn't feel itchy like I have in some places. So I was quite all right with the cleanliness. I did have issues with people not having "buffet etiquette" - using the same plate to go back to the buffet line, picking with their fingers to get at food when there are tongs there, using a spoon in the tray to not only get the food from that specific tray, but to reach and get the stuff next to it because you're too lazy to put the spoon down and use the properly allocated one? boo to you! I think it just came from living in Vegas and hitting the buffets with family and friends when they'd roll into town - Vegas was pretty strict and they had no qualms in telling you to get a fresh plate and to not cross contaminate the utensils. Anyway, I digres...It's rare to eat at a Chinese buffet that isn't greasy...and this wasn't greasy. The selection was pretty big and the fruit was so good! I was really taken by surprise by this whole place - food was fresh and actually good! They didn't use MSG and they didn't douse everything with soy sauce and salt.But...I was enjoying my food until...a biiiiig girl in a tiiiiiiny denim miniskirt with the words "Delicious" embroidered on the back part of her butt bent over and...much to my horror and chagrin, showed me a cat I did not care to see. It looked so ANGRY!My eyes welled up with tears and my friend thought I was choking until she followed my line of sight. "OH DEAR GOD!!!!" was all she could say. Even the gamers were rendered speechless. It was a total bonding moment between our two tables.What has been seen cannot be unseen.Oh dear God indeed.Indeed.

Review Text :
What can I say ~ I Love Ruth's Chris!From the moment I walked in I was waited on with the utmost attention.I made a reservation for some friends and I.I arrived early so I sat at the bar and ordered some calamari(see pics)PJ the bartender took very good care of me, he was funny without being obnoxious, we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers, he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have! I found a new favorite.(Whitehall Lane Cabernet)He was great company while I waited for my guests to arrive. Thanks PJ~Dinner was Delicious as usual, although I did notice they increased their prices a bit.I ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Ruth's Chop salad, Seared Scallops and the broccoli augratin. (see pics) I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater.My guests ordered the filet and crab legs, tomato salad, house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well.After dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in (see pics)I spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~Huh. I guess it's a love it or hate kind of place. Me? I love it. But put butter on a shoe and I might just kiss you. Oh butter, is there anything you can't do? Is there?This is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss.It's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat. I know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection. The service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye. Oh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. "Hold the butter." May save you some pain.One of my business partners came to town and suggested that we get a steak for dinner. He went ahead and made a ressie for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and since he was buying, he got to choose. We walked in on time for our 7:00 pm reservation to be told that they weren't ready for us yet...in a half empty restaurant. I was puzzled, but it seemed to be a ploy, more than anything else, to get us into the bar for a cocktail, before we went into the restaurant for...a cocktail.The service was, in a single well chosen word...perfunctory. Our waiter went through the motions and didn't seem particularly pleased with Ruthies or with us. None of the staff seemed up and happy. Nobody was really smiling or friendly, and every phrase, every question, every move seemed designed to "optimize" us. Every word sounded like it came out of the corporate server manual.The food was OK. If you put enough butter on anything, you can make it taste pretty good, and they put some  butter on them there steaks, let me tell you! The wine list is fine...I don't have the palate for fine pinot's that my partner does, but he found something from Oregon that he liked and you can't really screw up MacCallan's, neat:)After the initial enforced 20 minute wait for nothing, we were assembly lined through dinner in an hour. How very efficient! :)If it seems that I am being tough on Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, it's only because I am. You know, when I spend (OK, I didn't spend a dime, dinner was on my partner and believe me when I tell you I deserved to be treated to a free dinner) $250 for 2 people, I want to see the love from everybody in the place, from the minute I walk in the door, through bringing the ice water and the MacCallan's, to perfection in the art of appetizer's, entrée's, desserts and coffee. I see the love in other places (both considerably more expensive and significantly less expensive, so it's not a case of me just being crabby about pricey dinner spots:), and it just doesn't come shining through here.I just don't get that anybody really gives a crap at Ruthies'. I'm probably wrong, and everybody cares about us, "the valued customer", like the very dickens. As far as Ruthie's being a chain, so we should expect the corporate approach, well...I see chains where the service is caring and enthusiastic, even if they are serving double-doubles and a coke for $5.45, not steak and scotch for $100+ per, and the fresh faces smiling at me aren't making a $50 tip on my dinner, either. So I know it can be done...and should be done:)BTW, clear up the confusion for me...I know who "Ruth" is, but who or what is her "Chris"?While I tend to avoid chains, this was a gift certificate we needed to spend. Luckily Ruth's Chris does not feel like a chain - the manager is very much in charge and passionate about his work, as are all the employees.We had an amazing dinner here last night. From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs. The waiter (Francisco) was also a seasoned wine pro - he helped us pick the perfect wine and even took the time to recommend and write down some store bought Pinot Noirs we might enjoy later. The steak here is perfection. Aged, prime meat served on a 500 degree plate with butter. This is right up there with Morton's, Donovan's, and Flemming's! She tried the Steak and Lobster and while the lobster was very good - stick with steak!The staff all pitched in to keep my diet coke full. Excellent teamwork!In summary: at $100 a person they earn every penny!- Sorry you caught them on a bad night Donald!09/14/10My first visit to Ruth Chris' and I have to say "not bad, not bad at all!"  I really liked the subdued atmosphere- white-clothed tables, yet not too stuffy, intimate bar area, but still allowed for personal space; and music set to very low (great for conversation or working w/ a laptop).  Bartender was not too aloof, yet eager to answer any question when I had any.  Have you had a chance to look over Ruth Chris' HH (happy hour) menu, yet?  There's a lot to choose from!  Now that I think of it, I'm surprised I haven't been back since.  After studying the menu for many minutes, I decided I'd try the burger, which I'd like to say was $12 (or was it $9?).  Whatever the cost, it was worth it!Perfectly-grilled and juicy eight-ounce patty, topped w/ a GENEROUS amount of blue cheese, some partially-melted (oh my!), on top of a buttered and grilled bun.  The burger also came w/ lovely and superbly-crisped fries!  Not a soggy one in the bunch, which was great in the short-term, but not-so-great for me in the long-term (so many extra calories I'd normally be saving by ditching soggy fries!  LOL).  A must-order entree!BTW, I tried a little of the complimentary sourdough table bread and butter while waiting for my meal- crusty, good stuff!I have been to the Scottsdale Ruth's Chris several times for happy hour on the patio.  The view is amazing.  The problem is the service!Last week my friend and I sat on the patio for 20 minutes as the wait staff walked around, ignoring us.  When we finally ordered our drinks (which we had picked from the website happy hour menu) we were told that those were not on the happy hour menu...the waitress had no intention of honoring the website list, nor discussing it.  When our food came, my sliders were very dry...I waited for the waitress to come back around, so I could ask for mustard.  I waited...and waited...and waited....   Finally, I got up and asked the hostess to please get me some mustard.  Through the evening, I ended up asking the hostess for mustard, more water, and the bill because our waitress was missing in action.We didn't decide to go to a local haunt for a drink, nor did we decide to go to a mega-chain restaurant.....we chose the upscale spot, payed the upscale prices and expected an upscale experience, which we did not get!!!

Review Text :
I hadn't been to Frank & Lupe's for more than a year when I met a potential client there for lunch today.I don't embarrass easily...just look at the fact that I post my actual picture on my Yelp profile. I come from stout Norwegian stock (you want to talk about an internal compass that is seldom right but never uncertain and always unconcerned, it's the good Norwegian wood - gratuitous Beatles reference - that I spring from).But, jeez, I was embarrassed today!I remember this place as being better than this! Do I have early onset "old-timers" disease? Is my fondness for happy hours just the beginnings of a craving for "early bird specials"? I don't know.I got there a few minutes early and was seated and got chips and salsa (both the regular and the hot..I like the hot, but you never know about other peoples taste). So far so good...decent chips and decent salsa, although I seem to remember the chips being warm the last time I was here.It went downhill from there. My lunch meeting arrived and we chatted as we waited for our server to come and take her drink order...and waited...and waited. He finally looked at us (could it have been my frantic waving?), and dropped by the table to find out what all the fuss was about. Took her drink order and asked what we wanted  for lunch. We hadn't decided and that earned us a sniff and spin, and off he went. Another server brought her drink and we looked at the menu's while we talked business and waited for our server to return...and waited...and waited.I just want to iterate that it just wasn't that busy today...maybe 12-15 total tables, in and out, with 3 servers, so not a heavy load. Our server finally returned after another stint of waving (I had my workout this morning, but I got in a little extra upper body at F&L). He took our orders and we waited...and waited.My fish taco's came out, and we waited for my lunch companions Holy Mole'...and waited...and waited. 5 minutes and I motioned to him (less waving this time...he was looking anxiously between us and the kitchen by now). I asked him to take my order back to the kitchen and keep it warm until both orders could be brought out together...he didn't. Instead he said the mole was coming right out, which it did (if by "right out" he meant 4 minutes from now).This might have all been OK, if the food had been what I thought I remembered...it wasn't...it was worse...way worse.The fish in the taco's was not fresh...little tiny chunks of fish that clearly came out of a can. I tried all three tacos, and there was some variation in the flavors, but not from the fish.The mole may have been worse. I don't know, but for someone who was looking forward to the mole to give up after a half dozen bites was not a good sign.You know, it's never a good idea to have a prospective business relationship see you switch into full jerk mode over something as trivial as a crappy lunch (although I was sorely tempted), so I paid the bill, we continued our conversation and I will probably not get to pick the restaurant the next time we dine together. But it was a successful lunch in the business sense.I try to "vote local" with my dining and entertainment dollars, and I don't expect perfection, but could some of these places at least try? Canned fish in the tacos...really?!?!?! I don't think my memory is faulty...I think it was better, and I know I was looking forward to having lunch there today.Jeez...this was embarrassing!Yowza, if I could give this spot -5 stars, I would.As mentioned in earlier reviews, service is truly non-existent.  It's quite remarkable at the level of 'who gives a crap' that is on display here.I took a co-worker there for a holiday lunch, as she has a dish there she is crazy about. We arrive at one, and are seated right away. Drinks get to us eventually and we are able to order. My friend ordered a house special, and I ordered steak fajitas.While waiting for lunch to arrive, our drinks ran dry, and we also ran out of chips. While the restaurant was slow, with only a handful of tables occupied- the service was still a complete disaster. The wait staff was five feet away behind the bar hanging out, not paying any attention to anything.Eventually our food arrives, and they must have invented a new strain of white beef, because my steak fajitas are white and look like chicken nuggets, only drier. I asked our befuddled server if I was looking at chicken, and he smiled and replied that it was. I reminded him that I ordered steak, at which point he made a gas face. There was no attempt at service delivery, making it right, etc. To end the silent standoff, I told him I would just give the chicken a go.I am really laid back, and I like chicken, so I thought it might taste okay. As it turned out, the chicken was SO dry, and it was shaped like chicken nuggets. I have never seen chicken shaped like that, that was not part of  a meal you order at a drive thru. Moving past the shape, they were dry and truly tasteless. To replicate this dish, you would need old chicken, no flavor, and a hatred for the people you were cooking for.Wrapping up the cluster that was our lunch, my friend ordered some takeout to bring back to her co-worker. We waited for another 20 minutes and no one ever showed up at our table, so I went to the bar and asked about our bill and takeout. Finally I was able to pay and get the takeout bag, which I gave to my pal. I jokingly told her to check it and make sure it wasn't screwed up too, and she did. *** Spoiler alert, they messed up the takeout too. It was completely wrong. I brought the container to the server who replied with "Wow, everything is messed up." Cheers to you, good sir- we agree!While they went to fix it, I saw inside the kitchen, and it was pretty dirty. I can truly say that was my last and final trip to Frank and Lupe's. The food isn't terrible, but the service, price point, and utter lack of giving a shite make it a no go for me. There clearly is no one there to manage the business and ensure that people are being cared for, and that quality control is happening. Do yourself a favor and find another spot.  Hell, at this point Taco Bell on Thomas & Scottsdale is a better option. At least you know going into it that the food will be mediocre.in the order i noticed things:1.dirty, sticky wall2. large amount of ants crawling around the floor3. my carne asada tasted like hamburger meat4. FRESH lipstick on my cupI wish i could have noticed our waiter, but he was never anywhere to be found. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

It's your average McDonald's.  Fast service, average fast food.  I was running around and needed a quick lunch, so I went through the drive through and ordered 2 McDouble's from the value menu the other day.  It's a McDonald's, so my expectations aren't high...Not bad for less than $2.50.Return Factor - 50%This cafe is not a safe place for studying or getting any business work done. Do not come here if you plan on staying longer than a half hour - even as a paying customer.Today, while studying material for medical school, I was kicked out and asked not to come back. Apparently, I was there for too long. In my experience, Cafe and free wi-fi is to attract students/business persons to come, buy their product, study/work, and buy more product. The owner has informed me that no customer, paying or not, is allowed to stay at their facility for longer than a half hour.The owner also informed me that my family was not to use the PlayPlace for longer than a half hour - even if we made purchases every half hour.If you plan on studying/working, go to to another cafe. I stay at the Starbuck's across the street for hours on end and it seems to "fit with their business plan".  Of course, I nor my fellow students, have ever had a problem in any other cafe/restaurant that advertises free wi-fi. According to the owner, this is always bad business.For the business owner's "education"; http://www.yelp.com/topic/chicago-studying-at-cafe-etiquette , http://starbucksgossip.typepad.com/_/2009/09/do-you-care-if-a-computeruser-sits-in-your-store-all-day-nursing-one-cup-of-coffee.html, https://theinnocentlam.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/lifestyle-studying-in-starbucks-how-long-is-too-long/, https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100317141150AAshluO.

I was a little weary about coming here, because for some reason in my head I was thinking it was a Baja Fresh/Rubios type place, boy was I wrong.Most importantly, I think they made me the freshest squeezed margarita I've ever had. I also ordered some food, the delicious Adobo Pulled Pork sandwich, and guess what, it came with fries AND onion rings! I hate having to choose. Other than our entire experience being positive, the only thing I'd say could use some help is maybe the decor. Kinda bland, the bar is the best part, we didn't hang out inside much since we sat on the patio, so maybe some more plants on the patio to block the view of the parking lot.My friend lives way out East. North East that is. Scottsdale on the boarder of Fountain Hills. This is one of her favorite places to go. I have never been till this visit.I drove out there to find it quite easily in a nice spacious parking lot. It is beautifully decorated inside and out.A nice man opened the door for me as I came up and said Teresa, we have been waiting for you. My friend told him she was waiting for me. But, it made me laugh. He escorted me to the booth where she waiting.  The server came right away and offered me a drink. I chose water and coffee. She said ,I will make you a fresh pot. Which she did and I always greatly appreciate that.We both got the special of the day, Fish and Chips. They were wonderful!Big pieces of cod lightly breaded and nice FF. Along with a side of fresh cole slaw made with apples. Since it was 107 outside it was divine. Our service was wonderful, she refilled our water and the other drinks always on time.When it is cooler outside it would be nice to sit on the patio. It looked lovely. The ladies room was also, clean and nice.I would definitely come back again.

I stopped here for lunch the other day. The lunch specials were $7.25 so I ordered the Pepper Steak. The lady asked what level spice I wanted it so I tried level 8. The pepper steak had great flavor but I would go for level 10 next time since it could have been spicier for my taste. The meal started with a soup that I just thought was okay and a salad that I didn't try. The egg roll and rice that came with my pepper steak was real good.Service was good and the food came out quick. The price was right and portion of food good so I will stop by for lunch again.

We passed this spot many many times & never stopped. One of our friends mentioned the pumpkin bread is awesome so we decided to stop for brunch. Can I just say that we are a bunch of IDIOTS for passing this place up.*on our knees* "We humbly apologize Omelet House, please forgive us for our breakfast snobby-ish attitude."Lets  start with the exterior. Its very 1970-ish and its in between a storage property and a McD's right on Boulder Hwy. They have a huge yellow Omelet House sign towering over the bldg with another sign in the front that says "the home of the 3 lb burger." The interior decor was like a country diner, nothing fancy.It was pretty empty @ 11:30am (we aren't complaining) there were a couple families and a bunch of metro police officers. I believe that policemen know all the good eats around town and they were coming in and out of Omelete house...a good very good sign. The service was excellent. We got greeted and got our drinks...double quick. Our waitress Gina was very friendly and kept our drinks filled. She took our order and our food came out pretty quick. They have a wide range of menu items. We ordered the:-Homemade corned beef hash, potato fries, eggs up. The potato fries are different and addicting. Hash was ONO- it had more corned beef than potatoes ...my kind of hash.-Philly cheese chicken sandwich w sauteed mushroom & onions. My wife loved the taste of it but said she'll ask for light cheese.-We had to order a pancake just to try it, since they did sell a single pancake for $2.39. I like it like that- sometimes its a waste of money to order a short stack. Pancake was nice and fluffy, perfect golden brown.-We also ordered both  of the pumpkin and banana nut bread...they were both very good. I give the nod to the pumpkin bread.They also have the 3 lb burger challenge or a 12 egg omelette (we'll leave the challenges to Chestnut & Kobayashi).This is one of those joints that you don't judge a book by its a cover. They are only opened from 6am to 3pm, so don't delay...plan your next breakfast here and you won't be disappointed. if you aren't happy with their food...then you can pleasure your simple palette right next door at those golden arches. Aloha!!!

Apparently the original name was Fuckrudder's but for some reason that didn't take off. So a few multi million dollar advertising meetings later, waaa laa, Fuddrucker's. Ahhh, c'mon, it's still fun to say. Now, is it fun to eat here? Well, back in it's hey day, I thought it was pretty fun. Design your own burger. Grab a beer. Chow down. However, the last time I ate at Fuddrucker's, it was a sad sight. The "burger bar" was a disaster. Nothing really interesting for toppings. Except for the artificial nacho cheese sauce perhaps. And what was there was picked over like the last bologna wrapped pickle at a trailer park picnic. And speaking of trailer parks, even though this particular Fuckrudder's, ooops, er um, I mean Fuddrucker's is in tony Scottsdale, the clientele was, was, well they scared me.

What I want to know is who the hell puts sweet relish on a burger? Especially a burger that already has dill pickles.. I mean I love pickles as much as the next asshole, but I fn HATE sweet relish, so it pretty much ruined the whole thing. Aside from that, my curly fries were perfect, and they have Cherry Coke.. so here, have 2 stars.Ive been here twice... in the same week.(guilty....) the first time i walked in and it smelt heavenly!! i could smell the grills smoking away :) i love the retro interior... the silver and white tables and walls... i guess us blondes just like shiny things... who knows... i ordered a regular burger and a drink... the service was quick and orderly... i liked that there was a lot of room for people to wait and for those of us already seated don't have to have butts in our faces while we try to eat... that's a perk for sure... the location isn't to bad either... and like i said its huge for being a burger joint on such a busy street.... the Second time i went i had the turkey burger.... it was AMAZING!!!!!!! it didn't make me feel like i wished i hadn't .... it tasted in some ways better... and my favorite part of these delicious burgers is that they put RELISH on them as well and PICKLES!!!!! yum!!!! if i could... i would so eat here everyday.... mmmmmmmmmmmmm ::drooling::My first Fatburger experience! Check that one off my cheeseburgers list.I was properly warned that it takes quite awhile to get the food, and man were my advisors correct. We pulled up to the drive-thru at around 4 pm and didn't get our food until about 4:27. But that's because they make it fresh, to-order so you're not getting burgers or fries that have been sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long. And yes, you can taste the freshness in the product. Burger was good, fries were even better but the star of the meal had to be the strawberry shake. Cold, creamy and full of berry goodness... it hit the spot on a hot, Vegas afternoon. Normally I don't drink the entire thing, no matter how good, 'cause that's a lot of dairy in one sitting. This time, I absolutely drank it all. Fatburger would likely be in my Top 10 all-time burger experiences. It's good and a special treat since we don't have them in the Bay Area. But my heart still stays true to Krekel's Custard in Central IL.

What is it with this place?  Since moving to the valley over 18 months ago my daughters have been enamored with this place.  Actually it is starting to wane, thank God.How are these things all over the place?  Can't we make them get back to the mall food courts where they belong?  They are the McDonald's of Chinese food aren't they?  When I lived back east we didn't let these McChinese places get out of hand.  Valley residents have obviously not put them in their place in the scheme of things.Bad Chinese food fast!c'mon bro. you know i had to eat here. but they had the skimpiest menu ever. had maybe like 4 items. wtf. service was good as usual for panda. and this place was large but their items weak. where is my chicken and potato or chicken and string beans??

It was Sat morning and I was with my friend and we were headed to the dog park and said hey lets grab a bite to eat, so we stopped at Bagel Nosh. I love bagels, so why not!This was my 1st time at a bagel nosh and I have to say, what a nice selection of bagels they have to offer. I picked out a jalapeno & cheese bagel that was still warm from the oven and jalapeno cream cheese. Like I said the bagel was still warm and the cream cheese really surprised me, they have whole slices of jalapenos in the cream cheese, that right there was the bomb!  Delish I tell you!  Fresh bagels & great cream cheese perfectly paired together!

Review Text :
Holy bull riding batman! Here are some updates since my last review. Be sure to visit Buffalo Chip Saloon on Friday nights. The professional live bull riding makes it worth the drive, trust me. Since my last visit, they've built an entirely new edition to the Saloon where they serve the famous BBQ buffet. It's very nice and makes for a good place to sit and eat! I just love it here. This place is definitely what you would think AZ looks like if you lived elsewhere and had never been to Arizona, but sometimes even the locals need a little tourist social night in their life!Go on Wedesdays or Fridays!  Its quite a hike up to Cave Creek but its worth it :)  Real bull riding and its PACKED full of people. Everyone in Cave Creek and their grandma is at Buffalo Chips.  The place itself is huge with a dance floor, restaurant area, multiple bars, arm wrestling station (hilarious), outdoor eating areas, outdoor bars, rodeo area.... and its right around a bunch of other bars within walking distance (some are very 'biker' bar'ish' so beware but try Harold's Corral next door)  The rodeo is AWESOME and they apparently have amateur night which is somewhat shocking to me... but maybe they put you on a little pony or in a full suite of armor ;)    Great western crowd... more cowboy hat and boot wearing folk than I've ever seen in one place!  In my book you are a winner if you even attempt the arm wrestling machine.... that thing is freakishly strong and makes you feel like a wimp. Live country music is fantastic and everyone is out there dancing and swinging around! SO MUCH FUN! Dancing really is the best part of 'nightlife' in my book and I totally loved the country western dancing at Buffalo Chips.  WARNING:  DO NOT PARK ON THE STREET EVEN IF EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT.  Those Cave Creek patrollers are nasty and I got a whopping $200+ parking ticket as did the other 12+ cars on the street.  You've been warned yelpers! *This is why I have to give four stars... the cruel and unusual parking ticket left a sour taste in my mouth*I have to disagree with folks who say this place is touristy. Granted, this is THE place to take your out-of-town visitors. Last time I was here we had a friend from Australia and she was over-the-moon at her first real American experience. So yes, a lot of out-of-towners. But you CAN'T tell me that the folks tearing up the dance floor on any given Friday are your Uncle Murray and Aunt Sybil visiting from Boca.This is a fun place with a nice old west feel. They have great live music, the afore mentioned dancing, reasonably priced drinks, pool tables, a HUGE patio....and as others have mentioned, LIVE bull riding. I really need to come here more often because it is one of the funnest places in The Valley and you really feel like you're away from it all. Yes it gets uber-crowded, the line to the men's room is a long as the line to the ladies room and you're really kinda screwed if you really came here to play pool, but if there is ANY place you should take it all in stride, it's here.And seriously folks, quit bitching about the food. It's a $20 steak for God's sake. You get what you pay for and frankly it's pretty damned good-better than Outback or Applebee's. If that's not good enough then go to Mastro's and bring your own bull.Good times and I highly recommend.

My youngest daughter chose Chen's for our "date night" restaurant.  Every couple weeks I go out one-on-one with one of the kids, my wife with the other and we switch off.  Make sure we get some one on time with each of them.  They pick the restaurant (within reason).So we ordered fried wonton's by mistake (our mistake, we meant to order crab rangoon, didn't see that and ordered the first thing that sounded similar without reading thoroughly) and it was OK.  Fried wonton filled with pork and scallion.We also ordered the chicken fried rice.  Again, OK.  Nothing special, basic Chinese fried rice.  Safe.When it came to an entree' I said "Why don't we try something more interesting."  My daughter said "OK", and ordered sweet and sour chicken.  It was then it occurred to me that my kids have possibly never had sweet and sour chicken because we (and they for the most part) shy away from the standard fare at Chinese restaurants.Anyway, the sweet and sour chicken was also OK.  Oddly, a few of the peppers were cold as if thrown into the chicken at the last second.  Portions were good, there were plenty of leftovers.  The food was such that the leftovers have only a 50/50 chance of actually being eaten...Basically 2.5 star fare.

As I was searching for another authentic Mexican food spot to try out, I decided to give this spot a try since the reviews were great. The service was great from entering the restaurant by being greeting by the hostess and didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was very friendly and always checked up on us and right away we were served with chips, salsa, and beans. The salsa was okay I just wish it was more fresh than watery. I ordered the guacamole since everyone recommended it and it was delicious. You get to pick what you don't want in it because they make it in front of you. I went with the steak ranchero for dinner since I felt like some steak. I have to say it was made to my liking' not too salty and not too dry. Can't wait to come back here and try another dish!Was in Vegas for a friend's birthday weekend and looking for a place to go eat brunch/lunch at and one of our friends mentioned Bonito Michoacan, we all thought it sounded great so off we went!When I got there, I check in on my handy dandy Yelp App and guess what! Just checking in I scored a free margarita, how sweet is that!  But they also had a little text promo too that gave you a free margarita as well, so the table of 12 was already set with free margarita haha.They start you off with homemade chips, bean dip & salsa, the bean dig is great, mix it with the salsa and it becomes amazing!  Just take note, 1st round of homemade chips, bean dip & salsa are complementary, additional orders are 2.99, but we were a party of 12 and there was plenty.After checking out the menu I went with Zitacuaro - 2 enchiladas in a Verde sauce, I picked chicken for my meat, and I have to say these enchiladas were great, the corn tortilla I believe was homemade, it was perfectly cooked, the chicken was shredded and it was moist and very good tasting, however they season/marinade the chicken was delish! The Verde sauce was delish too! One of the best I have had, full of flavor and the perfect texture. These were some great enchiladas.Service was great and friendly, glad to have found this lil gem in Vegas!

Review Text :
Pretty much what everyone else said.  Excellent food, cheap prices, no-frills atmosphere.  Easily the best tacos I have had here in AZ, perhaps CA also.  They use good ingredients, high quality meat, excellent corn tortillas.  I didn't try to go during lunch when school is in session, I could imagine it would be a nightmare being right across the street from a High School.Right around the corner from my sister's ghetto-tastic shack, this place is bomb. Green chile tostada...hell yes! The place is not much to look at from the outside, not much to savor on the inside, but the only people hanging out here are Chandler High kids escaping 4th period. You stand in line, you get your paper bag of greasy goodness, you leave with a smile on your face. You hope your sister has beer in the fridge when you get back to her place.Elmer's is a randomly delicious hole-in-the-wall Mexican food spot that has been in downtown Chandler for roughly one million years. My family started going to Elmer's when we moved to Chandler from Milwaukee, Wisconsin about 20 years ago. I can safely say that it was my first experience of more "authentic" Mexican food, as the stuff we had in the Midwest seemed to have been made by people who had ONLY seen pictures of Mexican food, but had not actually tasted the real thing. (the Mexican restaurant of choice in WI during my childhood was called, unironically and naively, Chi-Chis... no joke) That said, I have great memories of this place! It is tiny, tucked into a small strip immediately opposite Chandler high school. There is a parking lot in the back that can be difficult to navigate when it is crowded. There is a decent patio, however I never end up sitting out there as the tables and benches are made of concrete, which feels like lava during the hotter 7 months of the year. The interior is not particularly special, but also has not changed a bit since I first visited; the furniture looks like it may have been inherited from a McDonalds or other fast food restaurant from the 80s, the floors are linoleum (I think? Maybe tile), and there are fairly cheesy murals of cartoony animals throughout. There is a wrought iron waist-high fence that indicates where to form a line, and a counter where the orders are taken. The menu is done in old-school marquis style, with plastic letters attached to the backing. If you're looking for something in particular, be sure to look at ALL of the menu boards - they have a large menu that stretches all the way behind the long counter, above the kitchen, it is not very well lit, and it is easy to miss something if you only pay attention to the boards that are immediately in front of you and easy to see. I have a few "go to" items - the Strips are oddly yummy... tortilla strips (in lieu of chips) topped with unmelted shredded cheese. Weird, right? They're crazy salty and for some reason, in the hot Chandler weather, the cool cheese with the crunchy chips usually hits the spot. Adding a dab of their hot sauce here and there (also very salty) adds a little heat and flavor when needed. The Cheesy Beef Tortilla is basically the one thing that I order here - not because other stuff isn't good, but because the Cheesy Beef Tortilla is just THAT good. It is a large tortilla (probably about 12" in diameter) filled with Green Machaca Shredded Beef, lots of cheese, tomatoes, and onions, then broiled. It is folded first in half, then in quarters and is usually a "knife and fork" sort of thing. In theory it is like a quesadilla, but in practice it is softer, fuller of delicious stuff, and just tastier overall. They do a good job with their Machaca - very flavorful, good meat (not too fatty, which is a problem I often find with shredded beef in Mexican food) I've also tried tacos, fry bread, burritos, etc - all good, at least standard if not better than most. Pricing is reasonable in my book. On a recent visit we got a Cheesy Beef Tortilla, Two Tacos, Two Drinks, and an order of Strips for around $12. The line/order/wait scenario is a bit of a pain sometimes - I visited on a weekend midafternoon and there were one or two people in front of me in line, which was not bad. However, once you order, you have to wait to hear your number called and pick up your food from the end of the counter. I think we probably waited upwards of 15 minutes for our food to be ready, and it was difficult to entertain the baby while also listening attentively for my number. I think they could definitely improve by creating a table-number setup for dine-in orders so that guests could take a seat, snack on their strips, etc while waiting for their food. The staff are pretty nice - not overwhelmingly friendly but they made things easy and had kind demeanors.I know I can't be the only one that thought of Elmer's glue when first seeing the name of this place.  Anywho, after a couple of visit to Elmer's, I have decided that Elmer's is a decent little joint.  I like it! Elmer's Taco's is a cozy fast food restaurant where you order up front, take a seat, and wait for your order number to be called.  The food they serve up here is Sonoran style.  Get your tamales, green chile mini burritos, bean and cheese burritos, machaca, and other delicious food here!  They also serve cheese and strips which are tortilla chips topped with freshly shredded cheese, not melted.  No matter what you order though, don't forget to get their salsa.  Brett B. had informed me that the horchata served here is powdered and that's why it's pretty gritty to drink.  That sucker leaves me more thirsty after drinking it.Across the street is Chandler High so if you want to beat the rush, come in before 11:30AM or after 1:00PM. The lunchtime rush consists mainly of Chandler High students and boy is it a rush --- the line goes out the door!So yes, come here for some decent eats!  Food is always hot, the staff are friendly and loud, and the tables are kind of small and cramped so you might want to take it home.  It's a hole-n-the-wall shop that delivers some good eats.P.S. No glue is served here.  ;P

For what this place is, [a cheap, tasty land of burritos (and some other mexican food)] It's gotta get five stars from me. I love it! My roomates eat there like 4 times a week, no joke! It's quality.A little greasy, which is why i don't eat there as much as them. But, if you want good, fast mexican style food. You have to try this place.:::::PROS:::::Clean, clean, clean.  The cooking environment, the floor, the condiment area, the tables - all spotless.Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Most burritos are in the 3-dollar range, and you can't beat the quality for the price.  The chicken burrito incorporated medium spicy shredded chicken done just right, and the breakfast burrito used eggs, ham, cheese, onions, and green peppers to get it done.Breakfast served all-day!  I know other Mexican restaurants do the same, but given the fact Fiesta Burrito is tantalizingly tasty, it just sweetens the deal.Great Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce at the condiment bar!  Need I say more?:::::CONS:::::None.Fiesta Burrito is nice and bright on the inside, and so seemed it's staff.  I believe the crew were truly enjoying themselves the day I went in and the smile on the man's face while washing the floor was refreshingly genuine and sincere.  Its obvious that its a well-run establishment, but its also one of those places that makes me wonder because the food IS so cheap...Seriously.  How can places like J in the Box and McD's sell Chicken Sammies for a buck?  And the three dollar burrito?  I just can't see the profit margin...  But then again, I've never run a restaurant.  I mean - Fiesta's ingredients can't be that cheap, right???Regardless, Fiesta Burrito is great bargain, and the food that I've tried so far knocked my socks clean off.  Check it out.This is my favorite of similar type places by far. We used to Los Betos at the end of nights on the town & in a pinch when we didn't want to cook (as there is one quite near). At some point, the quality had dropped far enough that we hit Fiesta Burrito. My sister had been lauding this place for years.Well, it is not only my favorite drive-thru/semi-fast Mexican food spot, it's one of my favorite value places in town. Cheap great food super quick. It's already kind of a stand by for me & the kids when the Mrs. does a girls night out. Also open quite late which is a major bonus (as both of my other cheap Mexican favorites have limited hours - Carolina's & Rito's).Their food is excellent. Super tasty, reasonable, quick. Nice clean atmosphere, super friendly staff.I typically go with the taco combination as they do the deep fried shredded beef tacos that are so yummy. Their carne asada is also brilliant. Great beans. They have a nice salsa bar as well. The Mrs. likes the green & red chile quite well too.Can't miss with Fiesta Burrito.Never in my many visits to Fiesta Burrito...and there have been a lot of them...have I been disappointed.  Never has the food tasted like it was made a week ago.Never have I had to spit anything out, hoping it had, at least, originated from the cow.Never have I had cause, or been afraid to check the restaurant inspections naughty list.I am a fan.

Review Text :
I can't say enough about how great of a happy hour spot this is, other than in my pretentiousness about living central, i will drive the half hour in awful traffic to partake in the coldest St Pauli Girl in the valley and eat amazingly delicious half-priced fresh seafood appetizers. OK, so happy hours should be cheap, and this one is C-H-E-A-P-E-R than if you actually ate at the restaurant portion and not the bar, but if you dive into all of the apps like i do, it will add up very quickly.  Still, the bar itself has so much character and being in the deep Arizona soil makes this place otherworldly on a hot Phoenix afternoon.  Careful, emerging back up to the surface will bite -- what with all that seafood and previously mentioned St Pauli Girl.This place is GREAT, and looking forward to eating a real meal here in their actual dining room.I really love this place, for three reasons:1) That nearly the entire restaurant is underground is really cool. There's something retro about that, though the place itself does feel modern.2) It's romantic, mostly because there are no windows and so it has very low light. It isn't noisy either - everyone there (when I went anyway) seemed to understand that the mood was low key.3) The lobster is actually fresh. They did what they had to do to get fresh lobster to the restaurant the day I showed up to eat it. You do pay for that kind of freshness of course, but please believe me - this is ALWAYS better than eating rubbery, whiffy lobster. If you're going to eat lobster without leaving town, pay the extra for it or stay home.It is a fabulous date restaurant. SO LEAVE YOUR KIDS AT HOME. The darkness and closed in feeling didn't work with the one that was there when I was, which was the one downside - a downside the restaurant had nothing to do with, of course.Otherwise, perfect.Seriously.....F*** this place!  Disgusting food and shitty service, ambience is great if you like to dine in a hot cellar engulfed in stagnated air.  Truly it is over rated, over priced, and they just under deliver.  Forget trying to order a drink here, it will take forever to get and when it finally does arrive you will be ready to pass out from heat exhaustion and lack of oxygen.  How's that for a head change, you don't even have to pay for it!I won't disgust you with the detailed review of everything I have tried here, but to make it simple, it all sucks!  And after you get the bill you will be walking out with a sore ass!  Save your money and spare your self the disappointment.This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.A little outdated, but then again so am I.  After driving by Salt Cellar for 3 years, we finally ventured in or maybe I should say we ventured "under."  It's quite small inside.  Maybe space underground is at a premium?  We had requested a booth after a suggestion in another review, and were accommodated after a short wait in the bar.  Good decision as seating is somewhat tight, but those booths are huge!Seafood is obviously their specialty, but there are beef and chicken options on the menu as well.  We started with Shrimp San Remo as recommended by our server, and it was definitely recommendation worthy.  I could have skipped the shrimp and just had the bowl of sauce and a basket of bread and been completely happy.I ordered scallops, sauteed in butter and sherry with fresh mushrooms.  How can you go wrong there?  Only if the scallops are gritty or overcooked, and they were neither.  Perfect.  My husband ordered another recommended dish, baked stuffed lobster.  A whole lobster stuffed with shrimp and crab.  Tell me that isn't an ingenious idea!But here's one of my favorite things about Salt Cellar.  I like crab, but never order it because it's just too much work to eat it.  Not here.  They do the dirty work for you at the table.  Now that's a reason for me to go back, even if I have to look at gold picture frames!The Salt Cellar in Scottsdale, Arizona has been around for over thirty years but after our first (and last) visit I think its time has run out.The only thing that has changed over the past thirty years are the charges on the wildly over priced  menu.With $35.95 for a 1 1/4 lb. lobster, almost $39 for Atlantic Halibut and $34 for crab cakes, we expected superlative food. Instead we received dishes that ranged from OK to awful. We started with Escargot on mushroom caps in garlic butter and New England clam chowder.  The clam chowder was a thin bland soup with a goodly supply of clams. The Escargot was chewy in a butter sauce with just a hint of garlic.  My Atlantic Halibut was fishy, dry and hard. After confirming my opinion with my table mates I sent it back. Overcooking Escargot and Halibut at a seafood restaurant should be considered fatal errors. My wife and granddaughter had Crab Cakes and Scallops which they judged just OK. Not good enough for almost $80.00 in (2) entrees. To the restaurant's credit, the Halibut was taken off my bill without asking. The restaurant is literally in a cellar. As the air conditioner cycles, the environment alternates between clammy and freezing.  We had a cocktail waitress (I haven't seen one of those in many years) which is code for over-priced soft drinks in a small glass with no refills. The Food Network has a show, Restaurant Impossible, in which the host,  Robert Irvine, visits failing restaurants and fixes their problems. If he visits the Salt Cellar his first stop should be the kitchen.You have to know what you're looking for to find this place.  I've passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.Return Factor - 80%The FRESHEST seafood I've found in Arizona resides in a basement. Well, really an underground restaurant. And being from Baltimore originally, I like to think I know a thing or two about fresh seafood! My wife and I decided to splurge for our anniversary and we mutually agreed that seafood was the way to go! Upon arrival for our resevation we descended the stairs to the "cellar" where we were greeted and shown to our table right away. We were seated in a dimly lit dining room with a few other couples, and despite what other Yelpers have complained about, we did not feel the least bit crowded!On to the food!! We ordered the bucket of steamed clams for an appetizer (looking back I wish I had ordered the escargot as well). They were steamed to perfection with good texture and flavor, and served with drawn butter and a clam wash! For my entree I ordered the Blackened Sea Bass and my wife ordered the Baked Stuffed Lobster at the recommendation on MANY Yelpers! Our meals were amazing! My fish was seared to a light crisp outside, but was still soft and full of flavor inside! Her lobster was stuffed with WHOLE sea scallops and jumbo lump MD blue crab meat! Our waiter Tony even cracked it for her at our table!All in all I'm very impressed with the Salt Cellar... food AND service! Don't believe the bad reviews out there. Bottom line: this is REAL, fresh seafood!I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.Service was excellent, and highly attentive.Food, absolutely horrible.My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies, blah.Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. I've had it with this place.If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristleI worked at the Salt Cellar for over 11 years and I recently started a new restaurant job in Sacramento, CA. Just the other day a table of mine caught wind of the fact that I just moved here from Scottsdale and immediately said, "My favorite restaurant is in Scottsdale, It's called The Salt Cellar!" Needless to say I was extremely proud to inform her that I had spent the last 11 years of my life working at her favorite restaurant. Now with that being said I feel like I need to make a couple comments about a few of the reviews I just read...When you go to dine at The Cellar you need to know that it is more than a restaurant, it is an experience. Most people choose to come for special occasions like birthdays or Anniversaries. By the way, they offer a complimentary dessert for those occasions. Most people can not afford the luxury of dining at a pricey restaurant regularly although there are plenty of regular customers that dine there. In my opinion you get what you pay for and if you want to eat FRESH seafood in the middle of the desert, you are going to pay a pretty penny for it. Go to the coast if you don't like the gas prices it takes to ship fresh fish in on a daily basis. The food there is pure. By that I mean it is not spruced up with glazes and sauces to mask the true flavor of the fish you ordered. Some people may think that is bland. But I think if the chef masked the fish with other flavors, he might as well buy it frozen. My last point about the price is, there is no a la carte. When you order an entree there it comes complete with a salad, bread and two sides. I have seen people leave the place leaning forward because their full bellies wouldn't allow them to stand up straight. There is a review stating that the place is not kid friendly because they don't carry high chairs. Well, personally that is an incentive for me since I don't have kids and would rather not listen to them scream while I'm enjoying my dinner. However, they are very kid friendly. The owner has two beautiful granddaughters who have been dining there since birth. And if you happen to get Cara as a waitress she will probably take your child on a tour of the restaurant to give you a break while you enjoy your meal. It doesn't get much more kid friendly than that!It may seem like my opinion is a little biased, but I have nothing to gain from this review other than spreading the word that this unique little gem of a restaurant needs to be experienced by you. If you are questioning whether or not to dine there based on the past reviews then please take this one into account. It's a unique and unforgettable place. It's privately owned by a couple that care about every guest that walks in the door. If you don't like your dinner, do yourself and the restaurant a favor and say something. Your server will get you a new one or something different. No questions asked. They want you to walk out the door happy as much as you do. One last thing, in my opinion the best item on the menu is the Alaskan King Crab. Not only is it mouthwatering delicious. Your server will crack it table side for you!I WISH I COULD GIVE SALT CELLAR ZERO STARS.If you enjoy being treated as if you are an unworthy piece of crap, you will love Salt Cellar.Short version: We were asked to leave because we were ordering drinks and appetizers, not entrees. We received horrible treatment from top down: owner, manager and server because we weren't spending enough money... and the money we were spending (probably around  $200+ total) wasn't worthy of a table. Now myself, my family, nor the friends I was with will ever spend another dime in this poor-excuse for a "service industry" establishment ever again.Details:Myself along with four other coworkers came here after work on a Friday to order drinks and food. We all arrived separately between 5-5:30 and put our name in for a table because the bar area did not have enough open seating for us. Two rounds of drinks and about 40 minutes later, we are seated. The waitress offered transfer our bar tab to our new waitress at the table, but we wanted to pay the bartender, to ensure he was getting tipped for his time helping us at the bar.Once we were seated, we ordered appetizers, and we continued to order drinks.  About 45 minutes in, the server came over and proceeded to say that if we are not ordering dinner, Salt Cellar needs to use the table for people who actually will be ordering dinner. So, we, paying customers, need to leave our table because we aren't ordering food of a certain price point? Mind you, we weren't just taking up space, we were still ordering food and drink!!!Naturally, our reaction was to question her action. She stood firm. We went to the manager to explain what had just happened. Then, the MANAGER essentially said yeah, if you aren't ordering dinner, we need you to leave the table because there are people waiting to eat dinner. Was extremely rude about it, too. (weird concept, waiting for a table at a restaurant, right?)That alone made us want to leave, and also made us realize that our waitress was probably told to say that, and it probably wasn't her fault. So on our way out, I apologized to our waitress for the way I reacted. The owner overheard me apologizing and asked what was going on, and I proceeded to tell him about our experience. To which he, THE OWNER, responded by telling me that I was wrong. Said we couldn't sit at the table if we weren't ordering dinner. He said that we "misrepresented" our intentions of what we would be ordering (we never said we wanted dinner) Anyway, I told him that it's wrong to treat customers that way, and he argued me. Told me I was wrong and we need to leave. Just FYI: we are not a rowdy crowd, we were not loud, annoying, inappropriately dressed. We are are all professionals who had just come from the office and wanted to go to (what we thought was) a decent place to enjoy each others company outside of work.I've been to the Salt Cellar a few times a very long time ago. This place hasn't changed at all. Small parking lot and a lot of people park on the street. Lots of street parking too. So you walk down two flights of stairs to the bar area and the hostess stand. Very small area with a few cozy dinning areas. Dim lights and romantic setting. All adults and no kids. We started off with the New England Clam Chowder. It's a huge bowl with lots of clams. Really good and the complimentary bread was so good and soft. Very fresh. We also had the Calamari skewer which came with four calamari on a stick with two different dipping sauces. Calamari was cooked perfectly and not too chewy. It was good not not great. So with your dinner you get a salad. I was thinking this was a small dinner salad but no this was a huge salad. A normal salad but with the chowder, calamari, and bread. We ordered way too much. 3 out of the 5 people in our party were full after the salad. It was way too much food before our entree. Anyways, I ordered the Salmon Wellington. The salmon was wrapped around spinach with a nice crusty outside. The salmon was moist and good. It came with a small baked potato and mixed vegetables. Nice meal and lots of food. My wife ordered the Mahi-Mahi with macadamia nuts with a baked potato and grilled vegetables. Like I said before she ate so much she had to take home her entree. Same thing with my son. He ordered the New York Strip with baked potato and grilled vegetables. My daughter had the Turtle soup because she never had this before. Black soup and I stole a bite and it was pretty good. She really liked it. They gave a little shot glass with wine in it where they burned off the liquor and you pour in the soup so it's not too thick. Like I said she loved the soup. She also had the Salmon Oscar with asparagus. She gobbled that down and didn't complain so I guess she really liked it. The service was great. They had multiple people serving you by clearing out the dishes and always filling your water cups. Very nice and friendly. Very helpful. It was a really good with lots of food, good food, great service, and a really romantic ambiance. Just remember to be careful with the appetizer. So much food but well worth it. I enjoyed it. Very different with the underground restaurant. Enjoy.Have you ever been to a place so fancy, that your first thought before you did anything was "Will this make me look like an uncultured swine?"Arriving early for happy hour, before my daughter's birthday dinner, we make our way up to the bar, as the first patrons of the day.  The no-nonsense barkeep, whose entertained both debutantes and scofflaws alike since the Johnson administration, greets us and in a gravely voice, asks "Whaddaya havin"In the lowest, manly toned timbre I can muster, I reply "An iced tea... please".  Looking into his expressionless eyes, I sensed that my drink order may have  just broken his spirit.He returns with my frosty beverage, and a basket of sourdough bread.Sourdough bread... it's the rich man's "funnel cake".A few minutes later, as we were seated next to Arizona's retired elite, who were downing vermouth and olive juice, scoffing at Ketel One, I noticed a plate of olive oil resting on the far side of the bar (see photo), I proceed to dip my bread... and then notice the viscosity is nothing like I've ever noticed before with EVOO.The plate of "coarse salt" to its left should have been a clue.  Nothing quite says "you dont belong", like dipping your sourdough bread in the margarita lime juice.Needing to salvage dignity, I quickly order the shrimp san remo and fish & chips appetizers... and hoped no one was the wiser.  I couldn't try the shellfish dish, but it was probably my daughter's favorite dish of the evening.  My F&C looked like big puffy cod beignets, and were delicious with their light batter.Our waitress then whisked us away to our white linen-ed table, where another full basket of bread was awaiting our arrival.  My daughter commented the feel of the room would go well with Disney's Pirates attraction.  After taking our orders, the waiter brings a tiny chaffing glass of yellowish liquid suspended over a candle flame.  I just assumed this was a heated bouquet of fragrance, being too intimidated to inquireMy daughter ordered her first lobster, and I, my first wellington.  Both of our assessments were exactly the same.  I'm glad I tried it, and I dont feel the need to order it again... everIn time, my curiosity got the best of me, and I inquired as to the canary colored solvent.  It was clarified butter.  Hmm, what exactly can I do with this clear elixir?  It wasn't simply put there for the fragrance.  As the uncultured swine that I am, I proceeded to Google "clarified butter", to better understand these fancy-man ways.Ghee, from the hills of India, which contains some unsubstantiated weight loss properties... so I immediately tossed it back... much like the two ladies with their vermouth and olive juice.A fun time was had by both father and daughter, as we bantered back and forth about our misgivings with the dessert menu, as "funnel cake" was noticeably absentAs we ascended the staircase back up to our awaiting vehicle,  we are instantly transported back from 1800's Spanish galleon to modern day, 104 degree phoenix... while that old, retired lady who was sitting next to you at the bar... you know, the one who had one too many vermouth and olive juices, looks back at you and says "hey, yous can go around me... its gonna take a while""Gladly, madame... gladly"

Review Text :
Does anyone remember when Mill Avenue used to be a fun place to hang out? Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. One thing I've noticed over time is that their "hot" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.I don't really have much to say about this place.  There's nothing wrong with it, but their dishes don't "pop" for me.  They are not very flavorful (crazy for a thai place, right?) and I often find myself adding Fish Sauce and Chili just to get it to be good.  Lunch prices are fair, food seems fresh and service is great.  My coworkers LOVE this place and I enjoy their company, so I tag along.Best part is they have soy milk for their Thai Tea.  For me, it's the best part of the meal.

Love this pizza shop!!! Great location, amazing hours (open till super late), tons of choices on the menu. The pizza shop has a new owner as of a month ago and a new menu too! So it's under new management and improved! Street parking infront. Great customer service. Indoor and outdoor seating. Very clean. I tried their pesto chicken pizza, white pizza with basil, bacon cheeseburger and fries and chicken Caesar salad. They have sooo much variety on the menu. They deliver and open till 4am during the weekdays and 530am during the weekend. Which is great for late night eats and an alternative to other asian options in Chinatown . Very close to the strip if you're looking for cheap and yummy eats after partying and they can even deliver to you! I'm a fan! Will be back for more!Flamingo pizza has a pizza my heart! Aloha 9th island.

OK, so we went back tonight for dinner.. I have to say, I was pretty peeved that they raised their prices.  So, now when I ordered just ONE shrimp taco, it came out to 4.90 with tax and all - are you flippin' kidding me!?!?!  It's about 5 shrimp, chipotle cream salsa, red cabbage, and corn tortilla for FIVE DOLLARS.  No way... I mean, they're pretty damn good tacos for being hundreds of miles away from the shore, but 5 dollars for ONE taco?  That's a bit presumptuous. Like I said before, I'm not expecting .99c value meal prices.. but I'm also not paying Scottsdale prices for a taco.Well, THAT was disappointing.  Seriously. Disappointing.  I guess I should start by saying the food tasted good, but it certainly was not WOW good. And for the prices we paid, it was not good enough.First of all there is no table service. You stand in line to place your order at a counter.  This is something that you expect when ordering / eating fast food, but, again, the prices are ridiculously high for not being a full service restaurant.  OK. So you place your order where you are faced with a somewhat insulting sign that states credit cards are destroying small businesses. As a small business owner myself, accepting credit cards is part of the cost of doing business. Then to use a credit card to pay for your food, you are then charged a RIDICULOUSLY high fee of $1.00 by the cashier.  Look I don't know everything there is to know about credit card processing fees but even when I was selling high-risk services I never paid more than a $0.35 transaction fee + 3%. So for a $6 meal of two tacos, worst case, Guedo's is paying $0.53. But, unless they are really business-stupid, and they are actually paying these high fees for a low-risk business like food service. They are significantly gouging their customers who want to pay with a credit card. Then, to add insult to injury, the credit card slip has a place to add a tip.  A tip? For what? Taking my order, that you're not even going to deliver to my table? So, we place our order and find a seat. The restaurant is dark and while there seems to have at some point been an effort at making the place seem festive, with a Taco Beach kind of theme, now the darkness seems to be intentionally aimed at hiding how run-down the place feels. A large open floor space area near the kitchen in the front of the house has a bunch of stuff stored on the floor out in the open. It just looks like they have completely given up. All of that could have been overlooked, though, if the food had been worth it. I ordered two tacos, which they charge $3 each for. My date's burrito was about $7. Now, these prices would not be too bad if there was some semblance of quantity.  My $3 tacos were the size of street-vendor tacos. Two small tortillas with some meat added.  That's it. Honestly, you can get these for $1 to $1.50 anywhere else and there would be way more meat between the sheets.  It was pitiful looking down at these two little tacos not even half-filled.   My date's $7 dollar burrito was the size of something you get at Del Taco for less than half the price. A plain tortilla wrapped around (again) a minimal amount of meat, beans, sauce, etc.  The flavor of the food was good but not nearly good enough to justify these prices.This was such a disappointing lack of food, that after eating everything we received, we ended up heading next door to the fast-food burger joint to get some food to fill us up.  How sad is that?This place came highly recommended to us, and while I agree the food is tasty, I have no plans to return.  And based on how few customers were there, I suspect others have come to the same conclusion.

I decided to try this place out based on good reviews. I was not disappointed.  I have been there twice and would definitely go back.  Green is located on Scottsdale Road and tucked away in a small strip mall.  It's not fancy but the food is terrific.  I had a spicy salad, and my daughter had a parmesan sandwich.  Both were excellent.  I love the green tea.  I will of course return for my third and hopefully more visits. Wish they had a place in Chandler or other locations.  It's the best!Green. I love you. You are my soul mate.Why? Because you have never once in our relationship treated me bad. Never. In fact, I know I do not deserve you.Normally I eat AT Green, but tonight I decided to order take out for the first time. I got the samosas and coconut curry with tofu. I didn't think it was possible to like anything better than the secret bbq chicken sandwich, but I think I found it. The gal said ten minutes, I got there in ten minutes, it was ready waiting for me.. packaged up like a gift from heaven... and by the time I got it home.. it was still warm. And heavenly. Also, there was some very pleasing eye candy sitting outside... maybe I should have eaten there. Silly me.How much do I like Green?  Let me count the ways...1. Garlicky, cheesy artichoke gratine2. I hum for your green hummus (I'd hum even louder if I can order this tahini-free!)3-5. Crab puffs, eggless rolls, and samosas!6-7. Jerk tofu and balsamic picnic salads. Tofu here is fried unless you specify otherwise8-9. Thai peanut and coconut curry bowls10. Thee "argentine" po-boy!11. No harm chicken parm12-13. Tahini coleslaw and those excellent thyme fries!14. Peanut butter and chocolate tsoynami... Tsoy very good!15. Vegan peanut butter chocolate bars16. Proprietor Damon Brasch, who I had a secret crush on (up until he grew a beard!).  Accidentally bumped into him and his wife having dinner somewhere.  Sweet couple.  17. For sale art displays by local artists adorn the walls.  Pretty cool.  The only thing I would complain about is the long wait.  It's been a few months since I last visited, so I don't know if the ordering process is still the same: order at the counter, receive food at the table.  If you spy any of those awesome peanut butter chocolate bars at the counter as you're ordering, make sure you grab one (or three!) as they will most-assuredly run out before you find your way back at the front of the line.  I just shuddered blissfully at the thought of biting into one of these... But I digress.  The wait for the food is worth it, however.  Just be sure to order any of the items I mentioned above, and you'll do fine.  (Do your tastebuds a HUGE favor and avoid the pasta items.  I've tried the orecciete pasta, singapore tofu, and the curry pasta salad.  I detested all of them.)Looks like Brasch added a couple of new items to the menu- ranchero salad and secret bbq chicken sandwich.  I'm going to have to get myself over there very soon to try some bbq!Note: the mock chicken used in the wings is not the same used in all of the other dishes.  A good thing, bec. the wings we ordered were VERY stringy.  This happens when soy is frozen sometimes, I was told.  The Argentine sandwich tastes just like a Philly steak sandwich!  I ordered mine sans vegan cheese ($2 add), but I soon regretted that decision.  I believe Green uses Follow Your Heart vegan cheese (melts very well!), so the addition should complete the deception.  Do yourself a favor and stop at Green for a bite soon.  Oh, and Green runs Friday and Saturday night specials from time to time.  I once had a green sobi noodle entree (wheat sobi noodles with a pesto sauce to die for!).  I haven't chanced upon any specials after that (this was around Valentine's Day '07).  I've given up on their specials, but I'm always assured that they still hold them everytime I ask via phone.  They allow call ahead orders for dining in so that the food is ready to be devoured upon arrival.  Just be sure to time it well so that food is fresh.Hubby has been eating mostly vegetarian lately, so we decided to check out Green. I don't think we'll go back. Everything we ate, we could get better elsewhere. Hubby's pad-thai-ish dish was pretty good, with noodles, a zippy sauce, and big crunchy veggies. All of which makes the nastiness of the egg(less) rolls even more inexplicable. They were positively mushy inside, and had both hot and cold spots. Maybe it's just me, but I like some texture and identifiable ingredients in my egg rolls. They were also weirdly spiced and arrived without the dipping sauce advertised in the menu. The busser admitted they were made ahead of time, which certainly doesn't help matters. He didn't seem to care that we thought they were bad- he just shrugged and said, "Well SOME people don't like them." Well, I guess we're SOME people then. We also tried the much praised pseudo crab puffs, and they were pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce that managed to come out with this plate. Hubby also had to have the soy "blizzard". He liked it, and I thought the taste was fine initially, but then had an aftertaste I didn't care for. The atmosphere is clearly meant for hipster youngsters. The lighting was so low that I literally had a hard time reading the white on black menu. Seriously, Green. Have some consideration for your clientele over 20. The last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff. As we finished our meal, they were starting to close. Hubby went up to the counter to order his soy "blizzard" and the too-cool-for-the-rest-of-us young man behind the counter had to ask a co-worker if they were still making them. Um, if you still have customers in the restaurant, I would imagine you should still be making them. It's not like we were in there for a half hour past closing, and there were still many customers in the place. One last observation: what's up with all the vegetarian and vegan smokers clogging the entrance? God forbid there be any animal products in your bodies, but bring on the tar and chemicals!?! As someone who quit smoking after many years, I would appreciate it if Green would insist that their customers observe the keep-it-20-feet-from-the-entrance ordinance.Vegetarians & Vegans: you're gonna love Green, that's for sure. The place is 100% vegan ingredients & food. And it is delicious!Everyone else: you're gonna like it too! Pretty much everyone that I've taken to Green or talked to that has been there (Vegetarian or not) has enjoyed the food. They've got an awesome selection of appetizers, entree items & deserts. Check em, yo.Green is A-OK with THIS meat-a-tarian.First, let me tell you I'm not a vegetarian. I like bacon way too much and I have a hard time even liking vegetables. I went today for a going away lunch with a co-worker and so surprised at just how good Green was!  I admit, I was totally trash talking the mock-chicken before I had it. It just sounded weird. Pssshaw...."mock" chicken. I'm just super excited about the fact that most of the bowls are gluten free except the Thai peanut. I got the coconut curry "chicken" and boy, was it tasty! They make it with tamari sauce instead of soy sauce, hence the gluten free-ness of the dish.If I wasn't so full from the artichoke dip I would have devoured a soynami (vegan blizzard). They don't have any gluten ingredients in them either, except for whatever toppings you might toss in. It's pretty rare that I can go to a restaurant and eat 80% of the menu. What a treat!Mmmm... I finally made it to Green for lunch today.  I'd been once before but only had a drink - not sure why it took me so long to return.  But now that I've eaten there, I'll gladly return anytime!I really enjoyed my Balsamic Picnic Salad.  (Toasted organic pecans, apples, strawberries and  figs over fresh greens tossed in a homemade balsamic syrup.) Delicious!  I went with the large version and ate it all!I also shared an order of thyme fries although my lunch companion and I agreed that we couldn't taste the thyme...I noticed there were a bunch of fun and unique vegan products for sale including some sweet treats that looked damn good.  Service was friendly and efficient (thanks Stevie).  I'll be back soon!First things first....I love meat! I will never become a vegan or a vegetarian. But I am not going to turn my nose to a restaurant that serves Vegan/Vegetarian options only. I loved the cool ambiance that Green offers. The staff is super friendly and gave me some great options since I explained my lack of vegan knowledge. I ended up ordering the mock fish and chips. Not my smartest decision. I have to remember never to order anything with the work mock in it. It doesn't mock the real thing, I don't care what they say. I did enjoy the fries and their artichoke dip was amazing. I even took home a very tasty cupcake. I would come back and try something a little more reasonable, like a salad or noodles.I already knew I loved @greendamon/Green because they offer a safe haven for vegans (and non-vegans) that realize being vegan or vegetarian does not mean you have to eat healthy, and that every meal doesn't have to be made of vegetables.So, there are some majorly delish dishes... the artichoke gratine, the samosas, orecciette pasta with meatballs, the secret bbq chicken sandwich... and they always have some creative special.Last night we stopped in after the Paso Robles wine tasting at FLEMINGS STEAK HOUSE... hey... we needed to counter all the flesh we saw being devoured.... and right before my eyes was the most magical and delicious creation known to man. Seriously. Like hands down best thing I have ever ever ever eaten. EVER!!So, Green - if you don't put the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich on your full time menu, I think you are denying the good people of Arizona what they deserve: perfection.An amazingly fresh and tasty roll topped with crispy bacon, chicken, mayo, fresh sliced avacado, CRISPY cheese, and jalapenos. Sure, doesn't sound that special...BUT I ORDERED TWO. I wanted to order another. I want one right now. In fact, I cannot imagine a moment in my life where I won't be craving this amazing creation.So - do yourself a favor. Try Green because the food is great, they care about all living beings, they have vegan blizzards, and one day they will have the best thing you have ever eaten on their menu.I'm going to write a letter a day until they add it to their menu. I'm serious. I can be a real pest.Delicious vegan junk food! I am not vegan. I will never be vegan, but I will throw down with the best of them at Green.There are so many delicious treats on their menu I'm not even going to bother naming off the things I've tried here. Just go, eat everything, and when you gain ten pounds don't come crying to me. 'But Kristi, aren't vegan dishes supposed to be healthy?' ummmm NO! If I wanted healthy, I'd poach a chicken breast and eat it with some dry salad and brown rice. Maybe slit my wrists and hop into a nice warm bath for dessert. I come here for fake meat that tastes like angel tears. The only thing they're missing is a liquor license. Located in a strip mall, this place is full of Bieber-esque lesbians and 10 day neck beards just as you would imagine. I don't fit in but when exactly has that ever bothered me? There is even what appears to be a (very tiny) vegan market of sorts inside if you find yourself in desperate need of some Dayia or faux marshmallow fluff. You know, true diet staples. The register area is full of mouth watering vegan desserts that will make you say 'I didn't know you could do THAT with raw cashews!' Man, I love this place...I haven't heard any news lately about the supposed 'new location' but I really hope that is still in the works as it is much closer to home. I can see myself picking up 3 orders of wings to eat in the privacy of my own abode while watching some god awful Lifetime movies on a Sunday. Bring it on Green.  nom nom nomI read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent "manhood" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon..."Asshole".He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy..."vote with your feet"...but I guess that's another review.The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!At the very tippy top of the "near and dear" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.Whit is a Vegan...with a capital "Vege"...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!The big question about Green is "why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?"I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.I like to "fit in".The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!Mmmmmmm Mmmmm Mmm........ so good! I was skeptical about mach meats, but was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were prepared. We ordered a couple of apps & 2 bowls to try. The apps were good, but my drunken mushroom "chicken" was executed beautifully! The best part? The "TSoynami Clunky Monkey" was a dessert that I couldn't stop moaning after every bite! Was that TMI?? Just imagine... Soy Ice Cream mixed with chunks of bananas, pecans, and chocolate drizzled throughout. Even if you eat too much and think you don't have room... don't miss this chance - make room!! You won't be sorry. Overall? Excellent! I am a fan and can't wait to try more on the menu!I was really happy to find another vegetarian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  My wife and I enjoy Loving Hut, but it's always nice to find more variety.We entered Green with high expectations considering the good reviews we saw here on Yelp.  I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.Chili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for "chili fries" here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't "chili" in any capacity that I would recognize.In terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.My wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with "mum's sauce" and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.The egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.The atmosphere was "hip" and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare "WE'RE VEGAN!" means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.  If you want to come here with a friend, share a basket of thyme fries or a dessert, you probably won't be disappointed.  If you want a great meatless meal in the Phoenix area, however, the Supreme Master Ching-Hai has the lock on it.Anyone who asks, "are you a vegan to lose weight?" should come to Green and eat their words. And everything else.In fact, I usually end up at Green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it's "Food you can eat that I actually like." Every dish is addictive, flavorful, saucy, and filling. Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins. Standouts include Tsoynamis  filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge, bananas, kitkats, hazlenut brittle, mint oreos and more.On another note, this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the Tempe/Scottsdale area with a lively, hip atmosphere. Even if you love steak more than anything in the world (and there are steak po'boys, might I add) at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place.Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.I've been anxiously awaiting to try this place for months!I'll start with the good...I'm not a vegan by any stretch and I thought the food was phenomenal! I ordered the Singapore orange bowl with mock chicken and noodles...just wonderful! Seasoned well, fresh veggies, and the mock chicken was a very pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to taste and feel fake, but the taste and texture was just like chicken! My friend ordered the MAC and I swear it tasted exactly like a Big Mac from McDonald's! The thyme fries are delish as well!To top it off I had a cookie dough Tsoynami...OMG...amazing. Like a blizzard that tasted and had the texture similar to mochi. I loved it.So clearly the food is not the issue. I will come back despite the problems I'm about to list because the food is so good!The bad...I was not happy with the service I received. Not warm or friendly at all. I don't appreciate that smug hipster attitude. Sorry. And they don't serve a hot chai latte??? That was annoying. So I settled for tea and they forgot to give me my hot water and then acted annoyed when I asked for it.My tea cup was dirty. It had lipstick on it. Hello, we are in the middle of a flu outbreak right now! Not happy about that. It is expensive. $5 for some ice cream (the tsoynami)? You will not get your money's worth here.Not many options if you can't have soy. It is in practically everything.The food gave me horrible gas (sorry tmi). Not the fault of the place but just be aware if you're not used to vegan food. Maybe it was the mock chicken and/or tsoynami because I eat veggies all the time.I was very impressed with Green.  I only came here because the people I worked with on a recent program had ridiculous food restrictions of the vegan variety.  I try to just cover my ears and not listen to them when they talk, because it's like listening to bubble boy.  Have we rebelled against our very nature?Putting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The "mock" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.  They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.  I would actually come back here, even if other options were present.  That's saying a lot.5 Stars"I couldn't help it. I can resist everything except temptation."   -Oscar WildeAfter consuming a small salad for lunch at home, Linh L. and I made the decision to try out Green's Tsoynamis around 3PM.  Being part of the 80% of Asians that are lactose-intolerant, I've been wanting to try out their decadent "tsoft tserve" soy-based ice cream.  A short car ride later, we sauntered into Green, the Garden of Eden, and were instantly tempted by the forbidden fruit in the form of a delicious aroma.  I was suddenly hungry and something warm was all too tempting."Would you like to see our menu?" asked the hipster-looking cashier.Yes, Eve.  I would like to see the menu.  Also, I swear you were in the art program at ASU with Linh and me...  Weird.Even though I really have been wanting to try Green's Tsoynamis since I first stumbled upon a picture of it on Instagram, I've been creeping on their online menu.  Ever since that celebratory lunch at Thailicious with the adorable Brett B. and Linh L., I've been dreaming of peanut sauce.  Naturally, I got the Thai Peanut with house tofu.  While it has great flavor and the sauce coats the broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and fried tofu well, it sadly didn't have a strong peanut sauce flavor.  I suppose I went into it hoping it will taste like Thailicious' peanut sauce salad dressing but that was my fault.  It was still delicious on the organic brown rice and I was full without feeling heavy and gross.  I love clean eats!  Linh had their special "RocknRolled Tacos" with Seitan chicken.  He liked it.  Although we were both full and satisfied from our impromptu late-lunch, where I dearly wished we had Brett B. with us, we decided to splurge and get dessert.TSOYNAMIS FOR DAYS!  My banana cream pie tsoynami was delicious.  Linh's Dough Boy was also pretty darn good.  It had giant chunks of cookie dough that made my skirt flip [not literally, unlike my time at Fired Pie].  I sat cross-legged in the booth merrily eating my lactose-free dessert while staring at the artwork, the car doors lining the wall, and all the artsy hipster customers and I was happy.  Outside the rain began to fall.  We came, we dined, and we gave in to the temptation that is Green.  Linh even left with a spumoni cupcake.  You guys are good.  You guys are real good."When women go wrong, men go right after them."  -Mae WestI think Mae was talking about Green and me.  My wallet is feeling lighter and all is right with the world.  I'll be back.  XOXO, Joyce W.The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for "ditto" instead of the "diablo red bowl".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her "coconut curry bowl" shared in that sentiment.The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites étaient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused "sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont".I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!Meet up with some friends for dinner, one being a vegan, and Green was the place suggested, and I was looking forward to checking them out.I bet you're thinking a meat eater wouldn't find anything good or filling at a Vegetarian/Vegan place, but I'm here to let you know, you can! And you will walk away full and liking the meal you just had!After checking out the menu, I went with Thai Peanut bowl, right of the bat I knew I loved spicy peanut sauces, so this was up my alley, and it comes with pan fried noodles (you can get rice too if that's your thing) sautéed veggies and I picked mock chicken to go with mine, but since I wasn't sure if I would like the mock chicken, I asked for it on the side.When the dish arrived, it looked like a great stir-fry bowl, it didn't scream vegan at all.  The mock chicken, to me looked like and had the texture of chicken nuggets, but were better tasting, I was kind of disappointed I asked for them on the side, instead of the dish so they could get saucy,  but next time I'll know.  This was a great meal, everything tasted great including the mock chicken.Glad to have tried Green, I also like that Green is Vegan restaurant that offers comfort food. Looking forward to trying out more dishes for sure!

First, I think it's important to remember what L'Academie is: this is Scottsdale Culinary Institute's casual, bistro-style restaurant. As such, every encounter with staff is an encounter with a student, from the host stand to the table service to the kitchen. Last night, we spotted the fruit and cheese plate on the dessert table upon our entrance. You see, while the menu is seasonal (maybe to coincide with semesters?), the desserts are changed out more frequently to allow for creativity of the student chefs. The offerings are displayed along with some featured beverages which you are forced to pass as you enter the dining room... a great way to remind you to save room (wink, wink). I guess you could say we had dessert first!Our "starter" featured slices of Manchego, and wedges of blue cheese and a smokey brie bordered by walnuts, pistachios, dried figs, apricots and cranberries and halved red and green grapes. Only real complaint: there were too few pieces of crostini (although we were graciously brought more upon request) and some of the green grapes had browned. Overall, it was a nice way to start the meal.I had the five onion soup. A velvety potage, the soup's aroma was slightly better than its flavor. A bit heavy on the pancetta and worcestershire for my taste.The presentation of the crab cakes  was lovely. Three timbales of crab and peppers surrounded a small bunch of fresh greens bound by a tomato slice. The vinaigrette on the greens was a highlight.L'Academie has a notable wine selection. I was delighted to find Molly Dooker's 2007 The Maitre D Cabernet Sauvignon on the list! Deliciously oaked goodness!Truth be told, it feels like a cross between a classroom and an average American bistro. But, you know what? That's what it is... and, what better way to support young people who love food as much as we do and want to spend their career bringing it to us?!

VERY tasty food but not cheap.I went here for lunch with coworkers and since I don't eat flour/wheat I ordered a chicken/kafta plate with rice, salad and garlic sauce.  The service was slow as there was only one waitress and what appeared to be the owner working, but the service was friendly and very accommodating.The chicken and kafta was honestly some of the best I have ever experienced.  Chicken was moist, well marinated/seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The kafta was perfectly seasoned, char grilled, and not greasy like I have experienced elsewhere.  The meat literally fell apart with my fork, so tender and delicious.  Add the garlic sauce... forget about it.  Unreal.  Fresh minced garlic and olive oil, yum!  The rice was also tasty and some of the best I have ever had.My bill for the chicken/kafta plate and Arizona Iced Tea was about $16.50, $19.50 out the door.... not cheap for lunch but I must say it was definitely worth every penny.  I will be returning as budget allows.Seeing Chris R's review for Pita House reminded me to review my experience too.  I stopped in for what I thought would be a quick carry-out order late afternoon / early evening on a Saturday... I skimmed the menu that was posted outside and walked in.  I recall hearing positive things about this place and figured it would be perfect for what I was looking for - a quick and somewhat healthy option to take home and eat quickly as I got ready for my night out.  Was that the case?  Yes and no.I was not sure which side to go in to order from... when I walked in, the one lady working there acknowledged me but didn't return to take my order for a good ten minutes.  Just as I was getting ready to leave, she apologized, but I was getting antsy and annoyed.  I placed my order and told her I'd wait for it... A greek salad and a vegetarian appetizer plate.Neither the salad or the app plate was the best I've had.  They were both fine.  I liked the combo of tabbouleh, hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves, and falafel... and luckily Jared helped me to eat it all as it was a lot of food.  It was more than $20 once I added a bottle of water though.  More expensive than I would've guessed.Will I rush back?  Probably not?  Will I return?  Possibly... not a bad option for Middle Eastern cuisine - and perhaps it's better if you eat in on a night when they have belly dancers or something?!  I'll update if and when I experience that.For all you alliterates out there. I've experienced quite a line of lackluster lunchroom locations as of late, and I'd like to learn what little leprechaun is leaning their bad luck my way.With that out of my system. I've got to say this place has got the market cornered on mediocre. A quick visit to their official website shows a claim of "Voted #1 Mediterranean/Middle Eastern ..." I assure you, they did NOT get my vote.As far as the service was concerned; we were one of two tables seated about 6 - 7pm on a Wednesday, the waitress visited us 1) to take our order, 2) deliver our drinks, 3) drop off / pickup our check. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food. Our waitress didn't seem rude during the few times she did swing by, but also wasn't excited for us to be there.We started with an order of hummus, which turned out to be neither here nor there, then ordered a Gyro Plate and Kafta (Kubideh). The gyro meat seemed pre-packaged and the kafta (grilled ground beef) seemed underspiced and bland. We did; however, order a tasty chicken skewer side, which was good. Nothing about this meal was really fantastic and I definitely not worth coming back. I'm guessing they do most of their business during late night after people have had too much to drink to realize they're eating a sub par meal.Be sure to let me know where your favorite Gyro is, 'cause I'm still looking!

I haven't been to rawhide in many years. Even at it's newer location it is still is a great play to take out of town visitors. Where the pavement ends and the west begins. The town and people look like they are from an old west movie. Rawhide is like stepping back in time. It allows you to forget all your troubles during your visit.  ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHNot your average tourist trap, no sir. Shee-oot this place was fun. Five stars for a lot of different things, but mostly the fact that these folk are in period dress and character, no matter how many degrees over 100 it is outside. That is dedication right there. This charming old west town has a lot to offer travelers, from fresh margaritas ("25 year old original recipe!!" bellows the guy from the shop window, as he lays into his dinner bell.), to taking your picture on a replica electric chair, to watching wild west shootouts in the street. "We've been here 10 minutes and already someone's been kilt," lamented my host, tour guide, and resident bf of the bff, as we moseyed into the general store. I was looking at shot glasses for myself and my gentleman caller and cat babysitter back home, when one of the "locals" snuck up behind me and startled me by asking if I was planning to steal anything. HA. Hilarious. They never break character. I appreciate how the general store is the first stop, and inside you can also ask questions and buy tickets for the attractions. You can purchase a ticket for each attraction, or a bundle for a bunch of them. As it was roughly one thousand degrees outside (or "normal" as the locals insisted), we opted for the outdoor show and a mechanical bull ride. I lasted about 25 seconds on the mechanical bull, and was offered two more tries, one of which I used. I had never done that before and having the chance to was great! No matter how hard I failed. The live entertainment spectacle was pretty fun. Lots of cheesy humor and gunfights. There was even an opportunity to get flyers autographed by the actors. Cute. I was told I couldn't have one because I was wearing a Giants jersey. I said 1889 World Series Champions FTW and made the guy laugh.It was really too stinkin' hot to do much else, so we made our way over to the Rawhide Steakhouse for some grub. This restaurant is actually really nice and offers some good food along with some....err...novelty items. We ordered fried rattlesnake and Rocky Mountain Oysters, with a side of jalapeno coins and delicious jalapeno cornbread. The "oysters" (read: fried bull testes) were actually kind of good. Chewy, but good. Rattlesnake was reminiscent of calamari. They even gave us little certificates to showcase that we ate these things. For dessert, we got to roast our own smore's!All in all, Rawhide may be cheesy for some or seen as a tourist trap, but they really pull out all the stops here to deliver an enjoyable unique experience. I almost feel like I got a legit time travel trip to the PG rated Old West!

I cannot begin to explain the sheer excitement I feel knowing that I have yet to review BOP. I better take a deep breath.... ...in.... out... in ... out... okay, I'm good. I love this place and it is so unexpected! I went to watch a friends band play next door at Chyro Arts and they invited me to BOP. I agreed thinking I was going to be miserable. But no. Not at all. This place is a freaking gem. Their food is SO FREAKING GOOD. The mac and cheese... omg... they have a bunch of food for veggies, which rules. I see from other reviews that they have pub quizzes and I am going to have to hit that up one of these days. The best part? They are at Scotts/McDowell, conveniently located 2 miles from my house. Oh, and the other best part, no yuppies. ONLY COMPLAINT ... the waitresses are a little slow.I'm writing an update because I came for Trivia Night last night and had a BLAST!!!!!!!!! Every seat in the house was full, but the service was on spot and the vibe was killer.. I also found that that they have quite a few flavored vodkas, including pomegranate, so I was excited to try something new.Again, the Mac and Cheese was SO good... I had two bowls. That's right, TWO bowls. What a pig. I think I will become a Tuesday night regular!The concept of a golf themed English pub in the desert is so foreign to me that I just had to come here. I had a Boddington and the jalapeno cheeseburger (cooked traditionally English style). The burger was nothing special. Wouldn't have it again, but would have the onion rings. Holy crappers Batman, are they huge. I kinda liked the style the place is set up, and even I am not aspiring to become a regular I will come back here when I need a place to have a beer and a conversation.. and possible some ginormous onion rings. The service is nice enough and the place seem clean. When I was here the clientele make up was of the standard regulars, a Led Zepplin listening couple to my right, and a girls-night-out table with 4 girls further in. The atmosphere was nice. Come try this place.

Restaurant name  Spinato's Pizza

Review Text :
I have been searching far and wide for a decent pizza/salad place I could get to on my lunch break for, oh, two years now. Fuck decent, this shit is delicious!!Thanks to the lovely Sunny B.'s review on the Spinato's in Central Phoenix, I decided to do a little digging and see if they had one anywhere near Tempe. And that is when I found this total hole-in-the-wall little shack of heaven a block away from Tempe Marketplace.I know we've all been taught not to judge a book my its cover, so seriously, do not let the meager building scare you away as there is a serious gem hidden inside.Chicago style thin crust pizza, oven baked to a perfect crisp. Heavy on the tomato sauce just like I like it, and a heaping house salad served almost immediately after ordering it. And they also have a bunch of gluten-free options for you unlucky Celiac sufferers out there.I am in love. I will certainly be back. After they get their liquor license, I might never leave.It seems that every which way you turn these days there are more and more gluten free pizza options showing up around the valley. Pizza joints around Phoenix have all gotten on the bandwagon since they see how big a demand there is for gluten free pizza in Arizona and how our little community votes heavily with our dollars - even in our current economic climate. Will I pay $15 bucks for a good gluten free pizza? You betcha!Spinato's was recommended to me by my co-worker as the best place for pizza in Phoenix. That was a pretty bold statement to make since there are so many good pizza places in town, and boy, Gary was right. I was blown away by Spinato's.First of all, the pizzeria is tucked away in a business park behind Tempe Marketplace and unless you know someone "in the know" you'd probably never stumble upon it yourself. This place is no frills - block walls, old concrete floors, and simple table setups, but the food is far from simple. It's fresh, cooked to order, and the service was fantastic.They have an entire menu devoted to gluten free item's, so there's no guesswork involved with ingredients or which combo's you can eta, etc..... I had the "Nicole's Favorite" pizza, which is Gluten Free Creations Signature crust, topped generously with slices of Genoa salami, artichoke hearts, onions, and lightly sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. It was perfecto!Now, let's talk about the sauce. I think their pizza sauce may actually be the best pizza sauce I've ever had. It was slightly sweet with loads of fresh tomato flavor, and perfectly seasoned. Each bite was a perfect balance and I had to refrain from eating the whole darn pizza so I didn't look like a total pig to my new co-workers. I politely took half home and then devoured the rest at 4:00 as a late afternoon lunch.  "Nicole's Favorite" is now "Jessica's Favorite! Well done Spinato's!This was the one Spinato's I had yet to visit and now I can finally cross it off my list! Sunday night rolled around and it was a pizza kind of night. When it comes to takeout pizza, Spinato's is at the top of our list but we were faced with the pining question: What location is closest? We decided that this location was the best choice and made our way down to this hidden pizza gem within an industrial setting. This Spinato's doesn't have the frills but it has the food! The delicious sweet sauce, the heavenly sausage and the fluffy bread. I gobble up every bite and I'm sad when it's over! It's best to ask for extra sauce because their sauce is their signature taste. The pizza is also perfect for left-overs so I suggest getting a larger one so you have some for the next day! We got the bruschetta to start and really enjoyed the fluffy bread and flavorful tomatoes and peppercinis. I love this pizza and think everyone in the Valley should try it because they will fall in love too!Meet up with some fellow yelpin friends on Thursday night at Spinato's Pizza.  I didn't even know Spinato's was there and very close to Tempe Marketplace, I just thought this was an industrial area.  This Spinato's has an opened feeling to it, its rustic yet industrial, guess so it can fit in its surroundings.  I also learned this location does not sell beer or wine or whatever booze they happen to have for sale at other locations.  I was running a little behind but I did get to sample the signature pizza, it had baby spinach, fresh roma tomatoes, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese, thick crust. This was a great pizza, simple but delish! The pizza sauce is on the sweeter side, not savory, but I personally happen to like it I also happen to be a fan of thick crust pizza as well, I'm not too crazy about thin crust, so this pizza was perfect in my book!  Service was great and food was good! Look forward to trying it again.We were dropping off my daughter at ASU and was looking for a place close by. We came across Spinato's. Hidden in the business park but found it cause of all the cars. This is a very small place and were seated right next to the window with the light shining in our eyes. They were nice enough to pull the shades down. We ordered the Family Caesar Salad with grilled chicken. Huge bowl and we had plenty for all four of us. Salad was crisp and lots of chicken. It was really good. We ordered the thin crust Chicago Pizza which came with home made sausage and green and red pepper mix. Such a really good pizza. Sausage was really good and the peppers were really good. We gobbled it all up. The service was really good. She was really quick with our drink orders and filled them up in a timely manner. She always asked about our meal and they exchanged our plates when we finished our salad. Always looking out for us. We left and my daughter left her keys on the table and they ran outside to make sure we didn't forget her keys. Very cool. Good pizza, good salad, good service. Do you need anything else? I think not. So enjoy.What a wonderful find this was for me!   Here I had no idea this place was even here.It is tucked away down a side Street near Tempe Market place.I really wanted some good Italian Food. I feel like I can never find good Pizza in the Valley.  This is it! Wonderful, fabulous, just what I wanted Pizza!The crust is delish, the sauce is awesome.  Nice and Hot , on a cold day. I am so looking forward to going back here.We loved our server as well. Great customer service. I do not think you would ever find it. unless you knew it was there. I am so happy I found it.Lots of parking all around the lot.A true simple, and delicious Italian food restaurant. What more could you want??

Restaurant name  Spago

Review Text :
Spago is a delightful respite for when you're doing some shopping at the forums, especially when you're not paying. The ambiance is modern and warm, but not necessarily romantic (it's a good spot to go with a best friend/shopping partner/sibling/gay boyf). Dinner was vaguely memorable (halibut and scallops). The service is friendly and impeccable. Not only was our waiter super nice and attentive to my sister and I, he brought out a beautiful complementary chocolate mouse at the end of our dinner with something along the lines of "living it up in Vegas" written in chocolate ganoush on the plate. Hahaha, ok, I don't remember exactly what it said -- we had mimosas with dinner, but it was a very sweet gesture.OMIGOD.. Did I die and go to heaven?This place sure feels like it. From the minute we walked in to the dessert that we shared, we were treated with the utmost courtesy.Food? OH YES. The food was amazing, I couldn't stop saying MMMMMMM... I ordered this- HAND CUT FETTUCCINI PASTA Wild Field Mushrooms, English Peas, Arugula, Glazed Shallots and Parmesan-Reggiano. And let me tell you, since I am a pasta whore. This was the best freakin pasta I have ever tasted!! Tender, tasty, delicately balanced. And oh so pretty. *see pix*BF ordered this- GARGANELLI BOLOGNAISE Braised Beef, Roasted Double Blanched Garlic, Plum Tomatoes, Ricotta Cheese and Italian Parsley. It was good too! Very earthy flavors and good for the meat lovers. We each had a glass of Riesling, which came with a cute lil carafe.. OMG.. so good. And a good buzz too. Sweet, but not overpowering. Very good complement to my fettucine.For dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle. This was good, but the sauce needed to be more warm. It was a bit too thick and hard to pour. *see pix*We sat outside in the cafe area and had a good view of all the people walking by in the forum shops. I love this place! Love love love. Highly recommended!! Now, if I can only find the recipe for that fettucine...It's a tradition for me to visit Spago whenever I am in Vegas. I can't get enough of their hand cut fettucine. However, this last visit was short of extraordinary. But, still the food was yummy.We came for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and were seated outside in the patio. Our waitress came over to get our drink orders within 10 minutes. BF had a Riesling and I got the Prosecco. I was feeling bubbly.The busboy dropped off a basket of bread which had some pretzel style crackers, square onion bread, and some other stuff. The onion bread was my favorite, but unfortunately, they only gave us ONE of those in the entire basket.. WTF.So, we asked the waitress for more of that bread. She came back 5 minutes later with a basket of bread that had everything BUT the onion bread. Stupid.Anyway, whatever, moving on.We got our entrees. I had my usual hand cut fettucine with Wild Oregon Mushrooms, English Peas, Arugula, Glazed Shallots and Parmesan-Reggiano. Delicious as always! Big portion too, took me a while to finish it. BF had the PAPPARDELLE PASTA À LA BOLOGNAISEBraised Beef, Roasted Double Blanched Garlic, Plum Tomatoes, House Made Ricotta Cheese and Italian Parsley. I think he always get this dish too. We must be creatures of habit. He cleaned off his plate in 10 minutes, so yeah, he liked it. Our waitress seemed to be missing most of the meal. We had a hard time flagging her down to get a second round of drinks.. I'm not sure why that was. Spago is usually great with service. But, it's all good! I got buzzed off 2 glasses of Prosecco. I ain't complainin'. Lunch was around $100 before tip. I'll still go back, just hope for more attentive service next time. PIX - http://pandaliciousforme.blogspot.com/2009/12/spago-las-vegas.htmlThe great and a grotesque in this restaurant made it an "eh" experience.First of all, we were bad and decided to sleep all day. This meant that we waited until 11 pm to eat dinner. One would think that this would not be a problem in Las Vegas. I clearly remember a wilder youth when this was not a problem. However, that wilder youth had much lower standards and we looked far too nice to settle for the cheap crap at O' Shea's. After several closed doors and unsympathetic hosts throughout Ceasar's, we found this place still open in the mall. They had a limited menu, but we didn't care.Our adorable, brunette waitress whose name I sadly forgot was stellar. Super friendly and attentive. Ten stars. No question.The food was ok. My non-Italian father could make better pasta. And I didn't like his pasta when I was growing up. However, the pizza was pretty good. Not incredible. But pretty good. Even the New Yorker tolerated it.The drinks were terrible. Both my manhattan and his martini were undrinkable. The bathrooms were a disaster. Absolute disaster. They looked more like the bathrooms after the 7th inning of an A's game rather than those of a nice restaurant in Vegas. I know it was midnight when I went, but come on. I should not have only one choice of stalls to go into because the others were dirty, strewn with paper products, unflushed, or had menstral blood dripping across them. Have some pride and clean your %$#@ing bathrooms. And while on the topic, seriously ladies?!?!?!?!? How drunk and tore up are you that you can't flush a toilet or wipe up your own period? Cleaning bathrooms is gross enough without your careless antics. Nasty skanks!So, get the pizza, order drinks they cannot screw up, and use the casino restroom instead.

Restaurant name  My Big Fat Greek Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Almost every single time we go, we have a great experience at My Big Fat Greek restaurant. Our latest trip (this past Saturday), was no exception.Food was awesome, service was good and the overall experience was great.Vegetarian recommendations: Greek Fries, Pizza Salad (so damn good), Vegetarian Moussaka, lemon potatoes & lemon rice.Meh, this place is just, alright. I came here with a bunch of co-workers for lunch last week, and wasn't very impressed. I got the hummus which was pretty good and the lunch special which consisted of a beef gyro and Greek salad.. it was decent, but I wasn't floored with the quality of food. The price was perfect though, a good deal for the amount of food they pile on the plate. I will give them a star for the sheer fact that the cups they serve their drinks in are enormous. I dont think anyone needed a refill. The passion fruit tea is tasty, the waitresses are really friendly and the atmosphere isn't completely terrible, its just the food that was the Debby downer, kind of like this snore-fest of a review.My traveling companion had me psyched for some steak the moment we landed in Phoenix... I was super set to chow down and then he remembers some greek restaurant that he once went to here that blew him away.... and this is how I ended up here one Thursday evening.I checked the Yelp app and after sharing that it was a solid three stars I was told "those Yelpers don't know greek food..." Ah, ok, let's see.Well, Phoenix Yelpers you did not let me down. M.B.F.G.R. is a solid three stars. The hummus was ok (I've had better home made over the last few years), the chicken and beef skewers were tasty but there wasn't a secret sauce that blew me away and the veggies they serve with them were standard - cut carrots, broccoli and zucchini. Or maybe I don't know greek food.They make the only baklava I've ever liked! It was softer and not as heavy as the ones I've tasted elsewhere. The honey tasted like fresh natural honey instead of candy. Me likee ;) They also have baklava cheesecake, which is their own creation and not offered anywhere else. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but it was yummy!I washed both of these desserts down with a glass of white wine. I forgot which one it was, all I remember is it was our servers favorite. Next time maybe I'll try a main entree, lol. :)The service was good. They accommodated a large group of us. Our server was professional & friendly. Parking in this area can be a bear, but there happens to be a big parking garage directly East of this location! Very convenient.I feel like a big fatty rolling out of here after I eat my weight in food. It's just that good! I'm a fan of all things Mediterranean and I've always been pleasantly surprised at how delicious MBFGR's food is. I particular like their hummus and gyros and I also really love their Greek french fries. Who doesn't enjoy a good flaming cheese!? I was especially surprised to realize how good their baklava was because I'm never a fan of baklava. However, they do something delicious to it and it made me a fan. This is definitely a good stop along the Mill Ave circuit and especially during happy hour when their pricing is practically a steal.First time I have ever been to this location here in Tempe. The hardest thing was finding a place to park! Other than that it was great. We got the appetizer with all the tastes of Greece. Grape leaves were wonderful, as well as the Hummus. Lots of bread was served with everything. Pita Bread and a type of bread in small slices, which was very good and fresh.So wonderful and delish was the Flaming Cheese! That was amazing!I got the lamb and awesome... I would get it again.We did get the Baklava cake, not my favorite. Real Baklava is much better.  Service was very fast and friendly. Restrooms were clean. I would go back here any time.

Review Text :
If this place were crack cocaine*, I'd snort it.  In short, magical happiness in the form of a Mexican/Cuban restaurant in downtown Vegas.  Believe it.  *Also, crack is whack. See:  http://extremecatholic.blogspot.com/images/whitney.jpgOnce in a while, miracles happen to me. It's often while I'm traveling, which is probably because (a) you're in a more desperate, survivalist state when you don't have your bearings and therefore unexpected discoveries seem more miraculous, and (b) when I travel I visit almost exclusively the historic downtown core of any place, which is usually where everything magical resides. Now, I may be the only person in the world who travels to Las Vegas to visit the historic downtown core, but this is who I am and you're just going to have to learn to deal with it. Also, fuck the Strip. It's the same shitty middleamerican crowd, it's just more expensive and larger scale, which are shitty middleamerican things anyway.Back to the historic downtown core thing, they appear to be doing some civic redevelopment stuff in the "East Fremont Street" area. So when LB and I were traipsing around in the 105 degree heat admiring historic neon signs and abandoned wedding chapels, and we noticed a big sign across from the El Cortez for "MEX/CUBAN FOOD", I knew immediately that a travel miracle was upon us. And it was. First of all, it is the cutest fucking place you have ever seen. From the neon signage to the bright pink and gold chairs and pleather booths to the waitresses' dresses, it makes you want to kill yourself for ever having eaten at a crappy Chevy's. It's the real deal. It also has a giant big screen TV upon which we witnessed the following: latin music videos on "htv" (hispanic tv? anyway, h-urbano was our favorite channel), music videos featuring booty shaking ladies and armadillos, and - this is for real - a DVD concert series of recent performances by KC & the Sunshine Band, Wild Cherry, and the Trammps. Now, if you know me, you know that disco music is the way to my heart. So Mamacita's, you had me at Play That Funky Music Whiteboy. But I'm not sure you had the large Mexican family eating at pushed-together tables, because they were not stoked when you turned off the Urbano. Also, I should add that the sound system is first rate, and I think at night it turns into a dance club. Sweet.So, we also learned, "Mex/Cuban" does not mean a mishmosh of two cuisines. Apparently the owner (?) is Mexican, and her husband is Cuban, which means they have two distinct menus, one for each cuisine. Which results in more delicious choices for you, the customer. I would recommend ordering everything under "side orders" and a Cuban Sandwich. That's what I did. You may want to play it more on the healthy side and order the vegetarian fajitas, or the avocado salad. I know this because I ate those, too. Also, make sure to get the yuca. It comes two ways: fried, and in an oily roasted garlic sauce. I mean, you might as well get both of those, too. I'm not going to lie and say we didn't.  You can also get an entire roasted tilapia, if that's your thing. We actually didn't order that. Anyway, the point is that the food in Vegas is so generally shitty that when you're ready for a meal that doesn't involve processed lunch meat or $0.99 shrimp cocktail, Mamacita's is there for you, so be ready to EAT.Also, the ladies serving you are pretty much the nicest people I've ever met, so if you are one of those assholes that is rude to cab drivers and waitstaff, please don't go in here because I will be forced to break knees.The customer base is eclectic. A nice mix of latin families, oddly misplaced white people and the local street characters, of which there seem to be many on this part of East Fremont. On the walk back to the hotel I was asked if my ethnic heritage includes Russian by a dude smoking a doob in plain sight, and I'm pretty sure I saw Aileen Wuornos order a burrito. But something about it was way less scary than the nasty hooker trash at the Palms.Everyone has been raving about this place, and we couldn't wait to try it. Located off off the strip on Fremont Street across the street from the El Cortez Hotel, (We parked there!) we were surprised to find it relatively empty at 9pm. (It was a FREEZING night!) For this one, I'm going to go with listing the Pluses and Minuses: (+)+ Easy Parking, across the street at the El Cortez+ Roomy, good for groups+ Cheeeep eats! Huge portions! (-) - What was the *DEAL* with them BLASTING the Eagles DVD and then after that the BRITNEY DVD on HIGH VOLUME at 9:30PM on a Monday night? I was running low on energy at that point in the evening and the volume was reaaaaaaly too high for me, cranky ol' lady. I hear they usually play salsa music, which is would have much preferred (not hatin' on the Eagles, actually.) - It was Freeeeezing in there- we sat near the window, perhaps that was why? Bring a sweater if you're coming here for dinner in winter-time. - The meals arrived ~20 minutes after we sat down, which is fine, but the plates were SUPER COLD to the touch... for those of you who know how much I love my food PIPING DANGEROUSLY HOT, this was a minus for me. Overall: a solid 3.75 stars, as the food was tasty tasty and it's a great deal on some Quality food. Service was friendly, and they let us sit around a few minutes after they closed, as we were just engaged in catching up.While staying at the El Cortez Hotel for the 2009 NASCAR races, my buddy mentioned that there was a little Mexican-Cuban restaurant directly across the street that he wanted to try out. I am so thankful that he suggested Mamacita's!I ordered the #5 combo, a Chile Relleno so delicious that I couldn't stop raving about the flavor in between each bite. Also included was a fried carnitas taco that was fatty & flavorful - a great combination at $10.95. What also set this place apart was the large LCD TV playing a video of Elvis Presley bringing down the house. Great DVD, great sound! On my second visit alone, I ordered the same dinner, plus two ice cold Coronas, while watching a DVD of the greats from the disco era.Probably the only reason that I would stay at the El Cortez Hotel again is that the hotel is so perfectly situated to this little restaurant - check it out!My friend Karen had seen this restaurant and had made mental note that she wanted to give it a shot. We decided this is where we would do dinner last night, before hitting up the Western for $1 shots and beers and then to Dino's for Karaoke. Wow where do I start? Waited about 15 minutes until we were finally approached for a drink order, let alone questions regarding the menu. I had never had Cuban food at a restaurant so I was a bit clueless on what certain things were. I asked the waitress what the house specialty is or what is ordered the most and or popular, she then points out a few things on the menu and says this is OK, um that is OK. Well you know what lady, I am looking for more than just "OK". Crappy service for starters, after finally coming to take our order it took another 15 minutes or so to get our drinks. The food took forever, and only two of four meals were brought. So I am sitting waiting until my friends food comes so I can eat. I said screw it, my fajitas are getting cold waiting so I dug in! After the non helpful suggestions from the waitress, I decided to play it safe and ordered the beef and chicken fajitas which came with a side plate of rice and beans. The fajitas were a large portion of dry unseasoned chicken and beef. Not much flavor at all to speak of. I have had better fajitas at El Torito's. Disappointment for me as even the rice and beans were bland, very bland! Friend #1 ordered a bowl of menudo, she said the flavor was not the best and she is an old school menudo eater. She asked the waitress prior if it their menudo had a red or white base, the waitress pulled the menu and pointed to the picture and said that is what it looks like. Also her plate was a sloppy mess when it arrived, menudo juice all over the plate and running down the side of the bowl, the presentation was just bad. I know they were rushing to get orders out but there is just no excuse for that slop to be dropped at anyone's table. I attached a picture, check it out.Friend #2 got the Tequila pollo dish with a side order of chile releno. The chicken was one big slab on the plate, would have made a better eater friendly and a visually appealing meal had they sliced it. The portion was generous but did not matter as the taste once again was bland as the other dishes we tried. Friend #3 got some sort of beef dish that was nothing but grizzle, all she was able to eat was the white rice and the black beans she spit up. Literally had a plate of wasted meat left. She probably should have sent it back as was basically inedible. The service was slow, and not very friendly, did not seem like a good outcome if a complaint was issued, I think that is the vibe we felt. Still I would have issued my complaint as they can not improve something if they are not aware or getting the complaint. Service and food very disappointing. The tab was $80.00 for four of us for bad service and plain, unflavored food. We will NOT be back. Also the flat screen TV blasting the Michael Jackson videos, over and over and over and over and over was overkill. We could not hear each other so we had very little conversation between the four of us. A hilarious moment, the waitress walked past our table and because the music video was soooooo freakin loud the waitress did not even hear my friend calling her! We just wanted to ask if they could turn it down. Several other patrons were talking about it as well. Ok they were not talking about it as I could not hear anyone, I mean I was lip reading along with watching people point to their ears so I am assuming they were thinking the same as we were that the music was way too loud. Don't get me wrong...music is my life but when I dine I am not really down for a taped concert at the same time. It was ridiculous how loud it was.This place sucks balls...and not the good kind! This place just gave reason for a bitch fest that night from my friends, and they are not even Yelpers! I never want to endure that again!They should also train their employees on cuban food, not cool for a specialty restaurant to have staff that is clueless in regards to the menu.Service sucks Poor food Pricey

Review Text :
2.25 Stars rounded down.  Like when your pencil needs sharpened and it's not much more than a nubbin.  Rounded down.  #2 pencil.  Food was serviceable no more.  Nickel and dimeing going on too.There was some heavy duty karaoke action going on in the bar.  Does the word "wail" mean anything to you?  If it does do it with pride.Atmosphere with inside/outside seating is OK.  Plenty of misters as well as plenty of Mrs.The grapevine, bitch.  Invariably, if I'm bombed in scottsdale or anywhere close, an overwhelming urge hits me to get over to the 'vine and hit up some karaoke, blasted into a microphone with an angry face but a heart full of love.Being the married chap that I am, I won't often be there, but if you see someone singing I'll Be There For You or Piano Man, know that it isn't all it could be unless Richard Z. is singing it, and throwing in his customary dash of Love (the secret ingredient).They have food? Sure, whatever.  By the time I get to the 'vine I am too sloshed to care about food and way too sloshed to stop drinking.  And any post-grapevine morning where I can wake up and remember all the songs that I sang is a failure in my book.I would now like to write another review for the grapevine, and this applies only to the grapevine when I'm singing George Michael's I Want Your Sex. One billion stars.The Grape Vine is one of the best venues in AZ to catch a Nathan S. show and believe me everyone should experience a Nathan S. show at some point in their lives. He is as talented and energetic a performer as the world has ever seen.I don't know what else goes on in this establishment but I do know that the karaoke here is tits or bitchin or whatever Scottsdale language is these days for neat-o. The song selection is fantastic, the crowd is awesome and most importantly they have a stage! I am a little bit of a performance god (see ham) and love a good karaoke stage. Watch me people, envy me, let me get you off! I am a golden God!!!Ahem...The patio is awesome and large. The drinks could stand to be cheaper for this type of bar but I guess when you drop it in the neighborhood that it is dropped in you have to do as the Romans (See vomitorium).P.S. I am hungover and haven't a goddamned clue what most of this review means.I came here with a group of Eliters after Thursdays OYE.. what better way to get to know a new group of people than through Karaoke? You find out whose shy, whose got shitty taste in music, whose heart is broken, whose the attention whore, and whose that fucking guy in the corner anyway? We were all previously sauced up, so why stop now? You have to be saucy for Karaoke. Drinks all around. We were also all full.. so no one ate anything, so I have no idea what the food is like, but apparently its good shit.All I can say is that there was a rockin' selection of tunes to choose from, an eclectic mix of people, adequate seating, full bar, and BONGOS. Fyes. I can assure you I made an ass out of myself, multiple times, but hey.. I had a damn good time doing it. Totally recommend this spot for you to do the same.I have two opinions of this place-it got a LOT better as the night went on. Not sure if it was the drinks...wine seems to make everything better doesn't it? We got there really early, like 8:00, to get a table for our large group for the evening, and the place was packed with Karaoke "regulars". When I say regulars, I mean these are the folks that probably would try out for American Idol if they weren't about 30 years too old for the show. Seriously amazing voices and talent, but taking it a little TOO seriously. You know the types. I actually felt a little uncomfortable and out of place until I FINALLY got to since my first song. Our waitress was a total bitch and tried to short change my friend $10. We hadn't had THAT many drinks that we wouldn't have noticed $10 missing on a $3.00 beer. Fast forward to about 10:30 or 11. Many drinks have been had at this point and the regulars have thinned out. Crowd is pumped, singing along, dancing on stage and having a great time! The place is packed with people who just want to sing along, dance, and get a little crazy - not try to score a record deal! My type of crowd for sure. Moral of the story: If you are a super serious Karaoke starlet that feels you missed out on your record deal, go early, like 5pm and then please leave promply at 10. If you want to go and shake your ass, sing along to every song out there, and have a grand old time, hit it up after 10. Just don't expect to get a seat.I don't really feel compelled to write to much about this place... only for the fact that i didn't have a terribly horrible time... but i didn't have the time of my life either.... i met up with some fellow yelpers which was the high light of the night of course :-)   ... but i was my own DD so no drinking for me... only lemon Water :) mmmm..... so good.... the bathrooms were very clean... but the toilets were so low i was practically sitting on the floor... and the stall door was so close it was about an inch from my knees... uncomfortable.... the last chick at the very end of the night had the mic last.... and she couldn't even keep up with the rap song SHE CHOSE.... so she apparently felt the need to start cursing at everyone else to sing it too... are you serious?? it completely lowered her from a lady to a tramp in 2 seconds... i was done... i would go again.... but i would definitely relocate by midnight....I LOVE karaoke & I would NOT be offended if you called me a "karaoke whore." I sing in the shower, I sing at the grocery store, I WAIL in the car, I LOVE to sing! So when my Yelp-mates decided to visit the Grapevine, I was allllllll inPlease know that the Grapevine is a dive and people here sing a ton of country music. They've got a guy who runs the karaoke and sits in a small booth in the corner of the main bar. You'll be able up select from two books, one by artist & one by song title. The song selection was decent but certainly not the best I've ever seen. The crowd is on average in their 40s-50s but if you're younger it's waaay more fun if you go there with your friends. The sound in the bar is a bit off balance but the Grapevine offers a fun time!!31 Yelps Challenge: #3/31This place is such a dive that it's awesome. I was in town with some coworkers for a summit and whenever we get together someone always mentions karaoke. Looking on the Yelp app for nearby bars or places to find such an activity, The Grapevine was at the top of our list.Sure, it's not a well lit, clean or fancy bar in any way. And service is a bit slow, yet friendly. But the atmosphere, the clientele and the karaoke host  were absolutely bad ass. The crowd was a mix of people above 50 and people around 25-30. So every other song was unfamiliar to half of the bar and every other song was either terrible (in a good way) or totally awesome. I had an absolute blast. While dive bars and karaoke are not typically my style, if I find myself back in Scottsdale for another work function, I certainly won't turn down a chance to come back to The Grapevine. A-OK in my book!Part of me wants to give The Grapevine 5 stars because I thought it was awesome. Just consider this...- At several points throughout the night our group was the only group of people in the place other than the KJ and bartenders. When this happened the KJ picked songs for us and made us sing them. Songs like I Like Big Butts or Short Dick Man- The KJ joined several songs in accompaniment on the harmonica.- It's a dive bar with karaoke!- At one point the bartender was making me a drink and singing a karaoke song herself.But, the truth is a 5 star rating might not be entirely fair. Because it is dirty and dim (as a dive bar should be). And personally I think they'd rather have their regulars in here than too many new, hipster-y folks indulging in the irony of singing a Salt-n-Pepa song while the older KJ plays along on his harmonica. And also, the place puts a hurting on your pocket book considering what kind of dive it is. I haven't seen prices this high in a karaoke joint since I last lived in SF. Ouch.I hate to leave a bad review because we went there tonight because I love karaoke  and that part was fantastic. however, this place really needs new bartenders. I think she said her name was mia, it was loud and hard to hear, but she was awful from the minute we got there. I arrived with a group of 7 people who  all ordered drinks. She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fiancé is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had. Mia needs to find a new career because service  and friendliness are not her forte.I have never experienced racism to this degree. Came here with my friends (of which we are all multicultural). It took nearly 2 hours to have a chance to sing. Even after tipping Gimli (the "Dj" who chooses who sings next) he still would push off our songs and give priority to all the other white patrons. We sang along with the American music we know, and cheered for the people we don't know. We were discriminated, and did not have the opportunity to sing our karaoke songs after 2+ hours of waiting. The same patrons (who seemed like locals and usuals at the bar) were given multiple opportunities to sing. Once we realized that they were pushing our opportunity to participate, we were approached by the owner who asked why we were leaving. We told him we felt discriminated, and he responded back by telling us "well, most people tip the DJ" even though we had tipped the DJ 15+ dollars. Out of the 3 people that tipped, only 1 person sang after 2 hours. I have not felt or experienced this type of discrimination / racism at any of the other bars or restaurants in Scottsdale. But walking into this location, I knew we were in the wrong place on the wrong night.Don't even think about karaeoking in Scottsdale unless you're white.

Review Text :
A Hangar Cafe Haiku:Butter Colored GreaseMagical, Viscous PondOn Plate, In BodyThe Japanese really had something going with these haiku.  If it isn't worth saying in 17 syllables, is it really worth saying at all?  True, this is contrary to every facet of my conversational style, but...I look for only two things in a breakfast place.  Eggs and hash browns.  If there are eggs and hash browns at a restaurant, it is a-ok.  But if you go to Hangar and sit at the bar, you will see them slathering a paintbrush into a golden vat and then smearing what comes out onto english muffins, into recipes, on to the griddle, and so on.  And that warms my heart in a way that would make every nutritionist cringe.  The bacon is cooked to that sublime level of disintegration where it just melts in your mouth.  Pancakes--decent.  French toast?  Actually quite palatable.But the chicken fried steak? Now we're talking!  A dish that comes with all four of the food groups (i.e. butter, fat, grease, lard) making a succulent primordial soup on your plate.  Bursting with flavorful morsels of sausage and beef.  The perfect hangover cure, and by that I mean that if you're hungover, go stuff yourself with this meal and you'll want to die, but at least not because of the alcohol you drank.  Everyone wins, kinda.Note: at 11, they no longer serve breakfast and who wants lunch after what I just explained to you?  Although I did have a croissant club sandwich and it was very respectable!  Just not, you know, chicken fried steak.There sometimes is a wait.  Deal.  Because if you're looking for a greasy spoon, you just found it.Diner category 4 star joint.  Tucked off the beaten path unless your path happens to be a flight plan.  This place is busy on weekend mornings.I've been a couple times for breakfast.  Good basics:  eggs, omelets, toast, potatoes, etc.  They are capable of cooking to order which is better than many places these days.  If you ask for your eggs scrambled lightly that is what you get.  The atmosphere is diner meets aviation.  To get to the entrance you have to enter the hangar area close to the runways.  Fun!

Restaurant name  Villa Pizza

Review Text :
I have been eating at this Villa Pizza for over 14 years. (They recently relocated). The owners have always been nice people and even though the pizza is a little over priced I enjoy it. When you pay $40 for a large cheese pizza and 15 fingers, you expect them to be good. I've never had an issue until today. I ordered delivery from this Villa (Cheese Pizza and fingers/hot.) It took almost 50 minutes to get here. which was fine...but when it got here the pizza was barely warm and the fingers looked like they had barely drizzled hot sauce on them. Usually they come doused in the sauce and they are hot and fresh. I was really upset considering I also tipped $6 to the driver. Since I've been a patron of theirs for years I decided to call and let them know my dissatisfaction. The owner's wife answered the phone. I explained to her the situation in a calm manner. She said that they took the pizza right out of the oven and delivered it. Which could possibly be true. I am sure they delivered several orders on the way to mine. She also stated that their chicken soaks up the sauce. I've ordered this exact meal several times and never had it in that condition. When I explained it to her, she got flustered and handed the phone to her husband. He then proceeded to yell at me and tell me that I was wrong. I was extremely offended and told him that I have ordered from them for 14 years. He said he would send me a fixed order. I told him it was not necessary but that I just wanted him to acknowledge that it was poor. He said he was sending a fixed order and that I didn't need to order from him ever again. I was completely offended. I could not believe that after eating there and ordering food to go for over 14 years that I would be treated so poorly. I can honestly say I will never order from them again as I refuse to support any business, small or large that would yell at customers like that. I am afraid to eat what they brought to "replace" the order as I fear it could be "compromised." I am so disappointed, to say the least that any business would treat customers that way. I will NEVER eat or order from this Villa Pizza again.

Restaurant name  Malee's Thai Bistro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I'm a bit picky about Thai.  Maybe that's why I'm so hard on Malee's. It's not traditional Thai. Which is not necessarily bad if you don't know the difference or just don't care.  The food here is decent.  The atmosphere is nicer than most Thai places. However, for the price, the quality of the food is a bit lacking and inconsistent. For example, I'll use my favorite Malee's dish--the seafood curry. I've ordered it 5 times and 3 x's it was great, 2x's the seafood was very over cooked and dry. At Malee's prices, that's not kosher.However, one thing I have to give them credit for is service--it's excellent.  The manager is very professional, courteous and does an awesome job taking care of any mistake from the kitchen.if you want Thai in an atmosphere that's more upscale than traditional Thai restaurants, try Malee's. if you don't care and/or are a cheapskate like me, and/or desire more traditional Thai, try Thai Basil in Tempe.I was so pleasantly surprised by the experience I had last night at Malee's. I was expecting your typical Scottsdale crowd, prices and wait staff, but what I found was exactly opposite. When me and the lovely CP entered, we were warmly welcomed by the hostess. This shocked me since most times hostesses are snotty as can be. We were seated in a large, comfortable booth and immediately greeted by our waitress, Angel. Angel was also extremely friendly, accommodating, had a really good knowledge of their offerings and provided really great service. I was extremely impressed with the prices. We got two meals, two beers and a glass of wine for under $40. I really enjoyed the dishes, and they were plated well. We got the yellow curry with tofu (+ tofu at no extra charge is awesome!!) and the Hippy noodles with tofu. Both were extremely flavorful and perfectly spiced. The ambiance was great, the food was great, the service was great and the prices were great. I have no complaints and I will be back for sure!COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!After my disappointing experience with Malee's at Desert Ridge several years ago I pretty much wrote the chain off.That is, until I was with a few friends on a Sunday evening looking for a bite to eat after visiting the DBG for the Chihuly exhibit.  The four of us decided on Thai & our friend that was driving mentioned Malee's.  We all agreed to give it a try after we realized that the other mentioned options were closed on Sunday evening.To start, Malee's atmosphere was not bad.  The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.  The service was marginal...  Our server proceeded to explain all of the specials, all of which he pretty much said were not good.  Pretty strange, but I always appreciate the honesty, but needless to say, we ordered off of their regular menu.The food...  The food was OK, nothing special.  I absolutely LOVE great Thai food, however, this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant.  Presentation was great, but the food was missing the real Thai flavors & covered with tons of sodium-rich sauce & oil.For those of you who rave about this place, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama for excellent authentic Thai cuisine.Back to the COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!After the four of us had our first serving of food with rice, I went in for another serving of rice from the community bowl to try my partners dish.  Amongst the rice was a "friend" looking up at me, a COCKROACH.  Although I am vegetarian, the fact that an animal was in the rice did not freak me out.  Cockroaches, however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant.  I already had my concerns after visiting the restroom to wash my hands before dinner, what a freaking mess!  But that's another show...After finding the cockroach in the rice, I brought this to the server's attention, trying not to make a scene & upset my friends who had all already eaten from the rice bowl.  I requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem.  He saw it & agreed to bring a new bowl, which he did shortly thereafter.  One big problem that I have with Malee's is that we did not receive any sort of apology for being served a COCKROACH in our rice.  I was not looking for a free dinner, but an apology was in order for such a disgusting situation from both the server & a manager/owner would have been nice.  Obviously the server & or management did not care that they served us a COCKROACH in our food.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about sanitation.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about their customers health & well-being as long as they get their money.Needless to say, I will never go back here again.  If you are looking for a good, authentic, sanitary Thai feast, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama.Malee's Thai Bistro is a Thai restaurant in Scottsdale.  Good not great in this Yelper's opinion, but you'll find some quality dishes in a contemporary atmosphere.My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - Malee's Thai Bistro has two dining areas.  You'll find a main room and another that accompanies the bar.  On our weekday visit, it was busy, full of energy, and had a nice vibe.  We sat in the room with the bar and it had a nice mural of Southeast Asia on the wall.  1 Star.Service - Our server was very friendly and helpful.  We did have a problem with one of our dishes (see below) and while she wasn't available during the meal for us to address it, she did have it removed from the bill.  Kudos for that but I would have liked a check in so we could have addressed it earlier.   1/2 Star.Food - Crispy Basil Chicken - order it.  It's the best item.  You'll get tender, well-seasoned chicken that you can pair with rice or any other noodle dish.  It's slightly sweet with a hint of basil.  We also enjoyed the calamari salad, although it really didn't seem like a Thai dish.  I guess it felt like it was a more American dish vs. Thai, but I was good.  Our Pad Thai was ok - nothing great but nothing bad.  Our one item that was really off was the Pad Woon Sen.  I love this dish - as it has thin glass mung bean noodles, scallions, and egg (main ingredients).  Our dish, however, had a hint of kerosene smell.  As we ate it, something didn't seem right.  We tried to flag down our server but she didn't come back until we were finishing up.  Now, they did remove it from the bill, but it would have been nice to of had the option to replace it instead. 1 Star.Will I Return? - Maybe.  Aside from the Pad Woon Sen, our meal was good.  Now, I think the menu has a lot of American influences, but there seems to be enough to warrant a return.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.(Lyrics - Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up)We're no strangers to ThaiYou know your food and so do IA full reviews what I'm thinking ofYou wouldn't get this from any other guyI just wanna tell you how it's tastingGotta go to a Thai BistroMalee's gonna serve you upMalee's gonna sit you downMalee's gonna serve a round and dine youMalee's gonna make you riceMalee's gonna fry noodlesMalee's gonna ask your spice and burn you!I don't recall how many times I've reviewed Malee's but it always turns out for the better for both of us.  Malee's has been a highlight of for Thai food in Oldtown for quite some times as I recalled when I first moved here; and you know what....it still is!Tonight was a special night as some of my friends and I gather for a birthday party and feast.  We ordered a bottle of wine and went for it.  I ordered their Crispy Pla (A.K.A Fish Candy).  They have other dishes that I love like the Crispy Basil Chicken; bite sized chicken glazed with a tamarind chili sauce, and Drunken Dragon Noodles; rice noodles and chicken tossed with basil and bean sprouts and lightly green curry sauce.  Everyone around the table wasn't sure about my order because of the name, but as dishes were being passed around my dish was becoming the star of the night.  Crispy fried fish drizzled with sweet and spicy pickled jalapeno garlic sauce on a bed of cabbage.  The sauce really was the star since I'm sure you could put in on chicken, beef, or pork and it would still be a great dish.I love Malee's for their traditional take on Thai food, but also the ability to fuse an American style to enhance it's food.  Overall, Malee's is a must go if you're ever in Oldtown Scottsdale!

Pong Pongs has been here forever. The food is cheap chinese food but usually has really good flavor. They have all the standard dishes.  The only bad thing is they use "parts r parts" chicken. I usually end up having a discard pile. (thx Ryan C) but can deal with it. Just do not go expecting great high end dining. They DO deliver!

Review Text :
My first Ethiopian experience in AZ.  Jared's first Ethiopian experience ever!  Friday night - no food in the house - I throw around ideas of places to go, Jared nixes them... this is how the evening started.  But somehow I convinced him to get in the car and head towards Tempe.  I knew there were some Ethiopian joints, and I somehow convinced him to try Lalibela!  We both really enjoyed it!Mona was our waitress... and she suggested we share the #16 (Meat Combination) and #17 (Vegetable Combination) to give us a variety of dishes.  That would've been plenty, but I also wanted to try the #10 (Shiro Wat / Ground Peas), so we had that too... oh and since Jared was starving, he ordered a Shorba (Lentil Soup) to start.  The soup was just ok, but the food was delicious!  We loved the injera (Ethiopian Bread).  and used it to eat the variety of dishes served on a big platter.  Our favorites were the Gomen (collard greens), Fosolia (string beans and carrots), and Key Sega Wat (spicy beef stew), but literally everything was good... we were stuffed after almost cleaning the platter!I have some friends that have more adventurous palates (ahem, Colleen C), so I look forward to sharing more Ethiopian meals with them at Lalibela in the future!And one last thing:  for anyone questioning Ethiopian eating etiquette, it says on the front of the menu that "traditional Ethiopian etiquette disapproves of licking fingers while eating (even though it may be tempting to do so).  I hope that anyone that shares future meals with me at Cafe Lalibela will adhere to this too.It was date night and his pick, and Café Lalibela was the place he picked. I have never been and was excited to try it out. It's a quite cute little place, we were there on a Friday night around 6pm, and it wasn't too busy. Service was great and friendly. After checking out the menu and asking a few questions I went with a 3 item combo, I picked the alicha sega wat, doro wat, and shiro wat. I'm not scared of the spicy and I love flavors! The alicha sega wat is a beff stew, tender chunks of beef that has been simmered in a spiced butter, onion, turmeric and other spices. Doro wat is a spicy chicken stew, chicken simmered in spiced butter, red pepper, onion and other spices and the shiro wat is ground peas cooked with berbere, onion, garlic and ginger, and I can tell you everything was just delicious! It comes with forks, but I don't really think your supposed to use them, its served with injera, which is like   a thin dense crepe/tortilla that is a sourdough bread and you just use that for your fork . I have to say the bread is amazing, loved the sourdough.The food has amazing flavors and smells, the taste was equal to what you smell, it just wasn't very eye pleasing, but get over that quickly because its some amazing stuff! It was a great date night, great food can't wait to go back.For May's International Supper Club UYE we went to Café Lalibela, after makiing reservations for a large group, we noticed when it came time to eating we were a smaller group than planned, but without any issues we were able to move to a smaller table to free up the larger one if needed.I won't lie, I have been here before and was looking forward to coming back, I already knew what I wanted too. I ordered the #18, it's a spicy combination of doro wat, kye sega wat and misr wat with selate and injera. The plate presentation really isn't pretty, blobs on dish, but the food is great tasting! So get over the plating presentation.  Doro Wat is a spicy chicken stew, it was simmered in kibae (spiced butter), berbere (red pepper) and onion flavored with various spices. The Kye Sega Wat is a spicy beef stew simmered in in berbere (red pepper) and onion and it too flavored with various spices. The Misir Wat, which is one of my favorites, is split red lentils cooked with onion, berbere, and herbs, if you love lentils with a little bit of spice then you would love this too! Selate is a side salad and it was great tasting as well. The Injera is a sponge like crepe that is sourdough, made with teff & wheat flour, its texture is different but its taste is great, its like eating the inside of a sourdough loaf.Service was great and the food was delish! Look forward to coming back!

I admit it...I like potato chips:)Back when there was about 60 pounds more of me to love, you could say I really liked potato chips:)But still, if you are looking at the classic "nutrition pyramid"...potato chips are stuffed in there at the tippy top, along with perfectly grilled bone-in rib eye's, single malt scotch whiskey and Dungeness crab legs...all good things and good for you, too:)At the Village Tavern, they have an appetizer called Colorado Potato Chips...freshly fried potato chips...with a bunch of junk on them.But, if you ask them nicely, they will bring you just a plate of the chips, all fresh and warm and salty, right out of the fryer...without all the rest of the toppings:)Now that's an accompaniment:)A grace note, if you will:)The Beautiful Carin and I stopped by the other evening... we hadn't been there in several months, and Sarah G's review reminded me that I have missed the good old Village Tavern.They pour a nice drink at the VT and have a " 1/2 price on any and every drink" Happy Hour, so we had a couple of inexpensive KetelOne marti's and decided to have an early dinner:)I had the Maple Cured Pork Chop and Carin had their Teriyaki Chicken...both were very good!At VT, they also make a decent prime rib, some very serviceable burgers, a crab cake sandwich that really uses real crab and tastes like a crab cake should (no, it won't transport you to Newport News, but it's good:), and a Chinese Chicken Salad that always seems to draw me in:)I've had all of these menu items before (and several other items as well) and never had a bad meal:)In other words...good, solid tavern/road house fare...except for the chips:)They transcend the genre and make VT a place worth returning to from time to time (not too often...got to watch the cholesterol:)The atmosphere is pleasant and the service has always been very pleasant and friendly:)I never feel that the staff is trying to "optimize" me or turn the table quickly.And finally, in a rare "double", I need to give a five star shout out to the Village Clubs...by showing my membership card for the Village Clubs at VT, I get a 15% discount on the entire bill:)I know...it's a chain and I do like to buy local, but come on...Village Tavern has those potato chips...Fresh, Warm, Perfect Potato Chips!Potato Chips...Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in:)Donald S. just reminded me I had not reviewed the Village Tavern yet.Eat at your own risk, I can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like. I la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until. Dun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud! We packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do.I've been here several times to grab a bite to eat and have a couple of Beers.  It's a great spot, the food is excellent!  Here's what I've had:Turkey Ruben w/Sweet Potato Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=PR3-qXFxVcULwd8qwpzZGQMustard Pepper Cheeseburger w/Cole Slawhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=9_5qO97PMWBTdRvUeZkyhgHopnot IPAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=5c6ql3lxSYm1xmkARu-CPgThe Turkey Ruben is amazing!  Full of flavor and with just the right amount of Sauerkraut....yum!  The Sweet Potato Fries are good too....I could eat a whole plate of those!The Mustard Pepper Cheeseburger was another interesting dish.....the Mustard gave the Burger a nice kick when combined with the Pepper.....the Cheese evened it out and the sweet, creamy flavor/texture of the Cole Slaw also complimented the dish.Kudos to the Chef!The bartender was really nice too.  He made sure I was good to go every visit.  I enjoyed watching the NBA playoffs here.Return Factor - 100%There is such a thing as "Grilled Meatloaf". And everyone should experience this wonder.It's not my mother's meatloaf. (Shh! Sorry Mom. This is better. I'm really very sorry.)Tucked on a corner of the The Shops at Gainey Village is a quaint little restaurant, complete with an outdoor patio. Alas, the patio and I were not properly introduced as the super comfortable looking loungers and tables were already scooped up. Instead, my friends and I were greeted like friends at the bar and found three (count 'em, three) stools right in a row waiting for us.I don't know if the patio is always this super busy, as this was the 1st Thursday of the month. There's music 1st Thursdays (until March of 2014) in the center area of the shopping area with different live bands.  I do know that reservations are not taken for the patio area. It's first come, first serve! So hurry kids, hurry! Those seats look mahhvelous.Given how delish the food was I can understand why. Hoh Boy.Our group took the hearty advice of Rick, a super bomb diggity bartender, and went with the "hot crab dip". The serving size is large and plenty for a group of three. If I were to attempt this at home I'd perhaps throw in a hint more spice. (Maybe a touch of celery.) But really, this gal was sassy pants happy scooping away at the dip. The provided copious amounts of toast to enjoy the dip which was rather nice.My friends shared a Cobb Salad. I had to laugh at them. The serving size was gigantic. HUGE. I turned away the opportunity to sample what looked like a wonderful salad. I was being single minded in my determination to eat AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE of my meat loaf. (My friends said the Cobb was very much to their liking. They eat out quite a bit, so I take their word for it.)Grilling meatloaf put a new spin on it for me. Ok, fine. The menu does say "Family Specialty". I was majorly bummed this morning when I remembered my left-overs where not, in fact, in my apartment. They were sacrificed in the name of car pooling.Yes, that happened. My heavenly grilled meat loaf was sent off to a better life. And I did not get to enjoy left-overs today.I will go back to the Village Tavern and eat this again.Thank you Rick the Bartender for a *great* recommendation! (Also, you were a wonderful server!)Oh! And the house red is a new friend of mine. (Five bucks!) Can't go wrong here.UPDATE! UPDATE!I sat on the patio! No wonder this spot is hard to come by. Very large area with super fine seating. Comfy. So comfy no one wants to get up :) This time my visit was during a Sunday brunch slot. Boy! No joke. 11:30 is a popular time. We were super lucky and scored the last table. On a Saturday, I doubt this would ever happen. (I heard men dragging their families inside with, "NO. We have to sit inside so I can watch "the" game." Yay for me! I mean, us. There was a group of us :)this place is good. kinda like your Houlihan's type restaurant. you know, like that restaurant in Office Space, but without the wait staff flair'd up. I had a blackened tuna sandwich which was pretty good with sweet potato fries. the sweet potato fries taste like they're lightly dusted with a cinnamon sugar maybe, can't be mad at that. it kind of enabled me to skip dessert. my doctor thanks you. sort of.

Review Text :
Are you looking for the ultimate cornbread?  Order the cornbread skillet (last time I ate it was $4 for a 5" or 6") and you'll search no more!  I began my ventures here on the recommendation of a coworker after I mentioned eating complimentary cornbread from Z'Tejas and the $2 basket at Redfish Grill and Bar.  I first started having one huge slice (you can substitute a slice for a side that comes with their entrees).  I then graduated to just ordering the skillet and having two slices.  On my next visit I had half of the pan (the server even commented how the meal I was having that night wasn't very nutritious).  I seriously believe that my corn allergy was aggravated with my obsession of Bandera's cornbread skillet :(I was able to try two entrees on separate occasions before I went stir-crazy on the cornbread.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, so do try some.  The salmon is also very good.  For sides, the spinach and glazed carrots are nice.  The enchilada my aunt tried was also quite tasty!  To help keep your wallet padded, have lunches here instead of dinner.  The vibe here is usually subdued, with great-looking staff and clientele occupying space, but it can get quite noisy on busy nights.  In the summer, try to sit at a booth with the window cracked open.  So refreshing, and quite relaxing- almost like having dinner at one of your chalets.Houston's, but with a less extensive menu...that's what people say about this place.And they are right...to an extent...so that probably explains why I actually like the place:)The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening (as you can see, I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like stories:)We have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale, Bandera is:* Close* Pretty Decent Food* Close* Pretty Good Martinis* CloseWe generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the door:)I do enjoy the corn bread...like corny, bready candy:)And the martini's are big and chock full of vitamin V (and priced somewhat less than the marti's at AZ88:)The food has always been good, the short ribs, the rotisserie chicken, the prime rib...you know, just good, solid, all-american fare:)Bandera is probably nothing you'd go out of your way for, and certainly nothing that I would queue up for a 90 minute wait for (during the winter months), but worth the stroll over this time of year:)So, if you're in Old Town and looking for corn bread, braised short ribs and an ice cold vodka marti, stop in and see the folks at Houstera...I mean Bandston's...oh, you know what I mean:After reading some glowing reviews of Bandera (specifically of their 'best on the planet' cornbread) here on Yelp, Krashawnda just had to try the place. We went on a Friday night and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes, though they actually were able to get us in a bit quicker. The hostess was extremely helpful and polite and accommodated us really well; even though we missed our name being called while we were out walking... upon returning she was overly apologetic and concerned with getting us the next available table even though it wasn't her fault... kudos for that. The ambience in the place is superb. As some others have mentioned it is a little dark, but we enjoyed that and found it to be rather relaxing and romantic. If you happen to be on a date this would be a great place to snuggle up in a booth together to enjoy the night. The darker lighting and decor creates a classy feel without feeling too pretentious like some other Scottsdale locales... although like any nice Scottsdale restaurant it's going to be hard to completely avoid the 'tool factor'... you're still likely to see a few spray tanned  Scottsdalians with their collars popped getting fueled for a night of mindless club hopping. Now for the best thing about this place... the food! The menu is pretty basic, no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes. We started out with a couple of appetizers; the deviled eggs and the much talked about cornbread. First off the deviled eggs were very tasty... I'm not sure what they used in them, but they had this slightly chunky consistency and the taste was different than the usual homemade deviled eggs I'm used to... kind of like deviled eggs on steroids; very good and cheap (About three bucks for four of them, perfect just to try). Next on the docket was the much ballyhooed cornbread. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread... but I have to admit; the other Yelpers are right on the money here; it's the best cornbread I've ever had. Each bite was like little fireworks of buttery crunchy goodness going off in my mouth. They cook the cornbread in this perfect way so that it's crunchy on the outside yet soft and moist on the inside. It really is heavenly... and this is coming from someone who usually passes on cornbread. For our main dish we split the rotisserie chicken sandwich and a half rack of pork ribs. Both were amazing... the ribs fell right of the bone and were served on a bed of super thin crunchy French fries. The chicken in the sandwich was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The sandwich also came with a small salad which was sprinkled with some kind of nuts and tasted very fresh. The portions were perfect... not too much but certainly enough to fill you up. We saved just enough room to try their 'Homemade Oreo Cookie Sandwiches'... and I'm really glad we did, I squealed with delight each bite I took... it was amazing. They were basically two medium sized crispy chocolate cookies stuffed with homemade Oreo ice cream... served on a bed of hot fudge. It was everything I imagined it would be and more; definitely one of those deserts that doesn't disappoint you when they bring it out. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a while. To add to everything, the service was also very prompt and courteous. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which is always nice) and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well, the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face, then complaining about you when they're not by your table... but that's really nitpicking, in fact I don't know why I even mentioned it. One nice quirk was when they brought us our bill the 'customer copy' of the receipt was neatly folded over the credit card like a little piece of origami... cool little things like that make a big difference when looking back at your dining experience. From start to finish I'd have to say the place really blew us away... it's definitely the total package and it's somewhere I look forward to eating at again. I can't imagine anyone going here and giving the place anything less than four stars. As it stands right now it's a solid 5/5 from us. If you're in the mood for some solid grub in the medium price range this place is a sure shotI went to Bandera when I first moved to AZ a few times and enjoyed it... and then a few years passed and I didn't really think about it.  But then all of a sudden, Bandera was on my mind.  I needed to go back!  Perhaps I was craving that cornbread or that warm atmosphere that I remembered, but for the past few weeks, I've been suggesting Bandera to whomever I'm eating with so I could return.I saw Bandera at Noche De Gourmet, and that just put it in my head even more.  So finally, this past Sunday night, I convinced my dining companions to go to Bandera!It was around 7:30pm... it was me, Jared, my parents, and Joan M (my mother-in-law).  We'd all worked up an appetite watching my brother complete in IronmanAZ.  We arrived at Bandera and luckily, there was no wait.I ordered the cornbread and grilled artichoke as appetizers for the table.  A few of us enjoyed a bottle of wine.  Our server was really sweet although perhaps a bit annoyed when my dad attempted to special order the sides that came with his fish.  My mom had the meatloaf, I had the Macho Salad, J had the rotisserie chicken, and Joan had a Caesar Salad and side of brussel sprouts.While I really enjoyed the appetizers and wine, my meal was not all that... On the menu, the Macho Salad is described "with Roasted Chicken, Avocado, Chopped Almonds and Goat Cheese." I ordered it without the almonds but it had some other surprises in there as well including cornbread croutons and dates.  Don't get me wrong - i like those things but I also like to know ahead of time what I'm getting!  The salad was huge and could've easily fed two of us.  Everyone else seemed satisfied with their meals.I know a lot of people compare Bandera to Houston's (and they are both under the Hillstone Restaurant Group umbrella), but I have to say, I think the food at Houston's is much better!  I will no longer be craving Bandera's food... but perhaps I'll return for just their cornbread!on this particular night, we originally had dinner rezzies over at The Estate House just down the street... but i was so strongly turned off by their hostess/wait staff hanging around up front when we walked in the front door there, that i convinced my group to leave.(and i've NEVER done that before in my life, which tells you how unacceptable it was)since i'm fairly new in town, someone else in our group suggested we go to Bandera instead. everyone else unanimously agreed and then proceeded to rave on about how much i would like it. we walked in, and were greeted by a professional and warm staff. it was so refreshing, in comparison to the place we had just left. since we didn't have reservations at Bandera, and it was a saturday night, we had a short wait. no problem, cocktails up at the bar anyone? there seemed to a tiny bit of a scene going on up at the bar... or, uh, rather what scottsdale *attempts* as a scene i guess. haha i mean, who doesn't enjoy looking at pretty people? even if they're trying way too hard to mimic what they think LA people are doing. *sigh* but i digress, back to the cocktails. made just the way i like them. the bartender was also great at handling the large crowd hovering around her while keeping glasses filled until our table was called.now this is where my love for Bandera started to drop. the menu wasn't exactly exciting.... however, if you're in the mood for a southwest/tex mex style cuisine, this place is definitely for you.(it's just not my thing) everyone at our table insisted i would *love* the cornbread appetizer served in a hot skillet, so we ordered that. it was tasty for sure, but not mind blowing or anything... for dinner the only thing that even remotely appealed to me on their menu was the filet (when in doubt, go with the steak i always say) which came with a side of grilled mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes. um, the steak was fine, but the veggies and mashers were just ok. not bad, but nothing special.happily, the service was consistently great throughout the entire night. they kept our drinks filled, and never made us feel rushed or that they were irritated with our requests.no one ordered dessert, but we all stayed around a little to chat over one last cocktail before finally closing out our tab.we left in great moods.would i go out of my way to come back? probably not, but i can see the appeal of this place to others. not all of us love southwest/tex mex food, but for those who do, you'll truly enjoy the experience here.Think of Bandera like Houston's with a Southwestern flair. Well, I mean it's owned by the owners of Houston's after all, so it's not a surprise it reminds me of Houston's. I enjoy Bandera for dinner because it's cozy inside and filled with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant without making it uncomfortable for customers. I like this atmosphere because we can have a nice dinner for two and be in our own element but it's not quiet either. Nothing's worse than being in a dead silent restaurant where the staff is lurking around waiting to hear your conversation. Now moving on to the food side of the evening. I have two words: southwestern cornbread. Oh my...I could eat the entire skillet, but I contained myself and just had a corner of it. It's filled with jalapeno, and chunky corn throughout the bread. It's amazing. It's so amazing, it didn't even need butter. That's a sign of good bread. I had the crispy chicken sandwich which was delicious but ginormous. In summary, I have Bandera on my rotation for great dinner spots when it's time to make it a night out but without making it a huge deal.My father's friend recommended Bandera as a dining location during our family's pilgrimage to Scottsdale. It's a popular restaurant - when we called up at 5:00pm to make a same-day reservation, the earliest available table was at 9:15pm. We decided to wait for a table instead, and were seated in about 45 minutes.A quick perusal of the menu told me that it was a Hillstone-owned restaurant: there's the "macho salad", a butternut and cheddar enchilada, homemade Oreo sandwich, etc. This was a bit disappointing as I've dined at a couple of Hillstones elsewhere and was hoping for a more original dining experience. But since we were there, we ordered:Grilled Artichoke (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#NXGmm9uLQ9DrIYJSSJffMw): 4/5 Who doesn't love a nicely-grilled vegetable? This was nice and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside, and served with a good remoulade dip. They serve this at every Houston's and is an appetizer I'll always order.Skillet Cornbread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#sd27YFMBnR2nFa0P4FY2og): 2.5/5 Another Houston's staple. There is much less cornmeal in this than in most versions of cornbread, and it's quite heavy on the butter. This combination makes for a heavy, non-cakey cornbread, which I actually prefer but will leave traditionalists a bit disappointed. You'll find corn kernels and jalapenos baked into it.Crispy Chicken Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#p25rQpHnyaxrdxQu8feqXQ): 1.5/5 I had this at Honor Bar in Beverly Hills and LOVED it. Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing. The chicken breast was flavorless in addition to being fried too long so that the overly-crispy batter was falling off. There wasn't enough moisture in the sandwich overall to combat a heavy-tasting bread; the kale slaw was really lacking in vinaigrette and there was none of the delicious honey aioli I remembered from the previous time I ordered this dish. It didn't get finished.Bandera-Style Roasted Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#Cc7HeytW61mGJIjsOjzuSQ): 2.5/5 I guess there's only so much you can do with rotisserie chicken, but this wasn't a huge step up from what you can get at El Pollo Loco for far cheaper. While the 1/2 chicken was moister, it was prepared with the same paprika and onion powder rub. The accompanying rice looked fantastic, but was ultimately very bland and herbed with parsley rather than cilantro.Banana Cream Pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ) 1/5 The only thing "banana"-y about this dessert were the fat slices on the plate. The pie itself had none. The custard wasn't flavored with anything (no vanilla, no banana, no nothing!) but was just your standard thickened egg yolk. And the whipped cream had no sugar or other sweetener mixed into it and was completely bland. This was less than half-eaten between 3 adults.We were a bit disappointed with our dinner and won't return in future visits to Scottsdale. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who has been to another Hillstone/Houston's in the past.Somebody please lower the flag to half-mast out of respect for Bandera's dead menu. I was wondering why they kept it dark in the restaurant. It was so dark, I could see the ghosts of past meals wandering around. 'Eeeeat meee.'I dined there expecting dinner, but felt like I got only small plates. I'll admit less is more sometimes, and with my finickiness and snobbishness for quality over quantity, I'd like to think this was a good deal. Have I been took, because I'm feeling jooked - hook, line, and sinker?Seasonal Vegetable Platter ($15) was pretty with bright primary and secondary colors of reds, yellow, greens, purple. It served a bit of cucumber salad (very tasty), cherry tomato halves, a slice of red bell pepper and a yellow slice too, broccoli, and disappointing bread that was soggy with something oily. Skillet Cornbread ($8) is about 6" diameter. It's good but crumbly and too sweet. I wanted a strong corn flavor with spiciness from the jalapenos, but I tasted no corn and no pepper whatsoever. Dip Duo ($8) with thick tortilla chips was delicious and I could not stop eating the chips. My impulse was to order more, but the ramification of eating too much of a good thing...ugh, I decided to pass this time around. First dip was avocado. Very good (no tomatoes - yeh!) and not salty. The second dip was of cheese and very salty - chunky too - like cottage cheese which was kinda weird. If you order it, do yourself a flavor and slap some of that salty stuff on the sweet cornbread. Winner! Salad ($10) was good with fresh greens.Enchilada ($7) of potato, squash, and shard was topped half-and-half in two sauces tasted okay.Other items on the menu include entrees and specialties ranging from $15 to $40 and desserts for $8.

I like that they lead with warm slices of ciabatta and a dish of bruschetta.  The bread is brushed with a touch of garlic.We ordered and shared several dishes:  chicken parmesan which came with spaghetti noodles and a nice marinara.  Cheese ravioli, a nice mild filling of ricotta and spices.  Angel Hair which was ordered with a vodka cream sauce that was also very nice.  And chicken and sausage cacatorri, my favorite.  Lots of chicken medallions, sweet and spicy Italian sausage, red and green peppers, onions and stewed tomato's with a flavorful and robust blend of spices.The portions were generous, particularly for the kids meals.  Prices were a little higher than average but the food was well above average.The service was great.  Papa Razzini's is not very big so the setting is a little more intimate than many valley restaurants.  I like a cozy Italian restaurant so that works for me.  The have some nice outdoor seating as well.I know, boring review.  Sometimes I just tell it like it is.Papa Razzini's is a great little family owned neighborhood Italian restaurant.They start you out with some warm bread and a bowl of tasty bruschetta. This is one of the best "free" appetizers that you could get at any restaurant. Love it!Their salads are pretty good, but the dressings are a bit thick. Due to this, we opted to go for an oil & vinegar dressing topping instead.For the main course, I can emphatically recommend the Bird's nest dish. I absolutely love it. Angel hair pasta with garlic, basil and olive oil goodness. I don't know what they do, but they make it sooo delicious.We love stopping in at this spot when we're out on the East side of town.

It is really sad to give this place a one star.  I was really excited to have an einstein near my house and I have been to two other locations of einstein bagels and this is the ONLY location that is completely horrible.  The people here a are completely rude and unprofessional. When I ordered the person that was taking my order just asked, "What do you want?....That's it?...Go over there."  He seemed so unhappy and hated life.  Now, I go on to the second register to pay.  I believe he was the manager of this einstein location and surprisingly he looked unhappy, too.  Sighs, I went to pay and I am sure he heard me say. "Wow, the people that work here are so rude."  I took a bite of my chocolate chip bagel with regular smear & it was overfilled with  cream cheese and my bagel is burnt. Sighs, shaking my head. I hope one day, I can update my review and give it a better rating.  As for now, one star is what they will get.

I really dig a good ole Mom and Pop greasy spoon diner.Unfortunately, with the corporate skullduggery muscling out the competition and brainwashing America to embrace the familiar mediocrity of preformed, seasoned sawdust, they're few and far between. I mean, if I want a microwaved meal the same 50 states over, I'd go to Applechilidennybee's. If I want some down home, from scratch, mama couldn't have made it better cookin', I'll go to Cindy's. Being a small business, the decor is a little hokey. They're not spending money on some razzledazzle, flash and awe marketing flare. (They have ads embedded into the varnish of their table tops, people! They're selling dining space for revenue! Just so they can keep their entrees cheap as sin!) We sat in a room that was a shrine to John Wayne, big enough to accomodate our 8 person group. There were no less than ten pictures of The Duke. (That includes four duplicates of that wacky picture where the scale of his hat is off and it cuts into his head about an inch.) And to top it all off, there was a mirror running the length of the other side of the room, ensuring that double The Duke stared down at us as we ate. Weird.But what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the tuna melt to be a sandwich of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp bread, smothered in cheddar cheese and pan fried to perfection. And the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.Everyone at the table ordered something different (from the hot roast beef dinner to the fried fish, Caesar salad to the pork fritter sandwich) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!So go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!

For a ghost town of a shopping center, this Red Lobster is busy.  It's always busy, especially during lunch.  Once you get past the mini-wait, everything starts to fall in place.  Service at this Red Lobster has always been great.  There have been times I've come here on a limited lunch break and told our server. To my surprise, they did what they can to get me and my group in & out.  On my most recent visit, I was craving a steak and also lobster. Then I found what I thought was perfect.  It was their Lobster Steak meal.  But if you've been here before, you know what this is. It's steak with lobster bits on top. I expected a lobster and a steak.  My bad, I should have read the menu better.  Also, the price was fair.  As for their other food choices (from previous review):-Bottomless Shrimp:  I don't know if this is daily or all the time.  But I have had it in the past.  Their fried shrimp has more batter than shrimp, but still pretty good. -Seaside Shrimp Trio:  Is a favorite when in the mood for shrimp.  It's shrimp pasta, fried shrimp, and garlic shrimp-Tilapia and Cod  I put these all together, but their cod is really good.  Big thick pieces of flaky fish.  Tilapia is prepared pretty good to.  Both are not fishy.  -Steaks:  Mixed reviews here.  I've had steaks here prepared either too dry or too greasy. The steaks are not as good as a Ruth Chris' but definitely better than a Chili's or Denny's. -Lobster:  My opinion, one of my favorites.  Portions small though.-Stuffed Sole:  Tried once and only recently.  Did not fill me up, but still good.  Order an appetizer!!-Glazed Chicken:  I know it's a seafood restaurant, but have stopped by for lunch just for their chicken breast.  About 7 total oz and usually have the sauce put on the side.-Calamari and Fried Vegetables:  An oxymoron, but you'll find it all gone before your soup arrives.  Usually gone from me and yes, the only way I will eat vegetables. -Red Lobster Biscuits:  Don't remember the actual name, but this is a must on every visit.  So good and perfect to dip into you chowder. Overall, I recommend Red Lobster. I've never had a bad experience and you get what you pay for her. Price for seafood here is just about right for the quality you get.  Just be prepared for a little wait at this location.Red Lobster is tradition in our family for many celebrations throughout the year such as Mother's day, Birthdays and Anniversaries! My most recent visit was for my Anniversary celebration with my sweetheart and it was a real feast!You know what to expect from Red Lobster however we were pleasantly surprised to see that they remodeled inside making the space more open and welcoming!We really like the more modern and contemporary setting they designed the previous space into.The food is always great, starting off with fresh cheddar bay biscuits, fresh salads, yummy drinks and appetizers.We always get great service and great food on our visits here so the consistency is there for sure!I attached photos of our yummy dishes and drinks that really satisfied our taste buds and bellies!The Lobsterita drink has always been a favorite of mine and I really enjoyed the pre meal buzz and warmth it gave me this time!The sweet chili shrimp appetizer I am still dreaming about! (lol)Awwwww, Cheddar Bay Biscuits! Really, what more can I add to Cheddar Bay Biscuits?  Those things must be made with crack because you will be addicted after the first bite.  Yummy!Ok, ok, now to the review!  Red Lobster is an A-OK restaurant in my book.  I don't visit it often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal.  It isn't fancy, but it sure is tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable for what you get.  They often have great specials, like the 4 course meal for $14.99.  And the best part, unlimited Cheddar Bay BiscuitsI   RL also has some great lunch specials for when you want something smaller and cheaper.  Most of the lunch specials are $7.99, which is pretty good for some seafood.   I always feel like I got a great deal when the bill arrives for lunch or dinner.  The menu is pretty big and quite diverse as well.  If you like shrimp, you are in luck because there always seems to be at least a dozen different types of shrimp.  They also have lots of other seafood options to suit everyone in your group.  Don't like seafood?  That's ok too, because they have steak, chicken, and beef options as well.  Everyone should be happy in your party.  If anything, everyone can just eat the unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  Have I mentioned how amazing those suckers are yet? Yum!The food over all is ok.  The dishes are ok.  Nothing is really special or outstanding, but it gets the job done.  The super highlight of the menu is the chicken tortilla soup.  It is super duper yummy and I think my favorite thing at RL.  It is a chain restaurant, so at least you always know what to expect, no matter which location you are at.The service here is usually pretty good.  They have a dud or 2 in the service department, but that is everywhere it seems.  I don't require much though, just keep the Cheddar Bay Biscuits coming and my soda filled and I am head over heels happy.  The interior is ok as well.  I know they want to be fancy, but it is still just an ok interior.  This location was recently remodeled though and is looking a lot fresher.So, the moral of the story is that Red Lobster is ok.  And guess what??? I will be back for some more Cheddar Bay Biscuits!

We have breakfast here on Sundays after church.  One of my favorite dishes is the low calorie Power House Burrito (6 Egg Whites, Chicken Breast, Bell Peppers, Chile Peppers, Pico de Gallo, 300 calories), $10.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-scottsdale-7?select=pydMTD8XrHB7urd0dZWh0Q#pydMTD8XrHB7urd0dZWh0QI can't believe this thing is only 300 calories!  However, I think it's legit because despite it's size, I don't leave the restaurant feeling stuffed....just satisfied.The servers here are really friendly and always on top of their game.  That's why we come here frequently.Return Factor - 90%

Just went there this past Saturday and was impressed with the food and atmosphere. The only sad thing was how empty it was - both for the owners (who are very nice) and the people that are missing out on it. By comparison, Pita Jungle next door was packed and I seriously doubt the food is any cheaper or better, not to mention the atmosphere. We had a bunch of appetizers and ordered the koobideh as a side item - it was a lot of food. The persian salad and the hummus were both huge, enough for 3 people at least. It was fresh and delicious - try it, you'll be glad you did!If your business says you are open until 9:30pm, then you should be taking customers.  If not, lock your doors.  We arrived at 9:15pm and asked if food was being served as we could sense a hesitation in the greeting.  She went to "check".  Afterwards, another woman came out (the head honcho) and told us, "We can serve you, but you'd have to be out by 10:30 (with a straight face and looked us in the eye).  My friend looked at me to see what I was thinking.  I was already on my way out the door.  That was highly disrespectful.  There is a way to talk to people.  Just say your kitchen is closed.  I don't tolerate ANY level of disrespect from ANY establishment.  So maybe your business is doing THAT well that you feel you don't need new customers.  (I don't think any business is is in that position, especially nowadays).  I don't care what you're serving up in there, no thanks.  There are way too many places to eat...pause.Anyone who is looking for authentic, Persian cuisine - stop looking! Tasty Kabob is by far the best establishment I've been to across the country. My fiancé ordered a dinner entree of lamb kabob skewers, basmati rice and salad. I ordered a chicken kabob and kufta kabob (koobideh in Farsi, minced ground beef in English) with basmati rice and salad. There is a nice lady who greets you and takes care of your order when you first arrive; I found out later she is the owner. So when I asked for the regular kufta kabob plate (2 skewers) - she recommended I try a mixed plate instead. She was right! The mix of chicken and kufta gave it such a better taste than kufta by itself. There is a short wait time (thank God) because we had just left the gym and we were famished. Happy as hell that we didn't have to wait a long time, we devoured our plates. It was absolutely delicious, and I cannot forget to mention how huge the portion is. I just wish I took my usual pictures for my fellow Elites and Yelpers so you all can run over here tomorrow. And whomever ends up coming here, send me notes and post the pictures! You won't regret it.

This is one of those establishments that make me wish that we were allowed to give ratings in 1/2 star increments. The location (Papago Plaza, on McDowell and Scottsdale Rd.) is excellent; the restaurant is easy to find and parking is more than ample. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The buffet offerings are one gustatory delight after another. I wanted to go for seconds for almost every dish, and knew I shouldn't because there were so many to try. You get more seafood offerings here than in most buffets, and I like that they offered fried, baked, and poached fish dishes. The dishes I found outstanding: the fried chicken, the ceviche (with tostadas!), and pretty much all the shrimp dishes. Rand H., Mike C. and I kept commenting to each other how good each of the things we got was. However, two of my favorite dishes in buffets were a disappointment here: the sushi was very bland, and the squid was rubbery-chewy. Also, although the buffet serving area was very brightly lit, I found the main dining area to be too dim; the dimness level was such that some candlelight on the tables would have been a nice and practical touch. These are the few things that prevent me from giving this buffet restaurant the full five stars. Still, the meal was very enjoyable and  in my buffet list I consider this establishment to be one for repeat visits. Four and a half stars.

Review Text :
O.K.  I made a visit albeit still skeptical.  I absolutely must point out first and foremost that anyone who views this as a good destination for anything related to New England OR Seafood is one of three things.1. Owners of the restaurant2. never had good seafood before3. never had good seafood beforeThe clam chowder is a pasty concoction that does not begin with bacon/salt pork, has bits of chewy rubbery clams, is tasteless, and overall would recieve a boost with the addition of a couple of cans of Snow's.The fried clams were horrible.  The only plus was that they were not strips.  They were actually "Bellied" clams but I use that term VERY loosely.  Price will always determine the quality when it comes to clams.  they cost a certain amount of money and there is no way to get around that.(unless of course youre not using Ipswich Clams)  There is no way that these are from Ipswich Shellfish Co.  The batter is terrible as well.  Why would anyone choose to fry a clam in anything but an evaporated milk/corn flour dredge??Any new englander who has had a good chowder from legal, Sole, etc. or a clam from the clam box, essex, or Ronnies knows that this place is not your fried clam destination.Wait!  i almost forgot.  the tarter sauce was horrible as well.  Can i give zero stars??

This place is 3 stores in one, a restaurant, a bakery and a meat market.  I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars and meat market 5+stars.I've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation a couple friends and I went for a prime rib dinner.  My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there.  No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving.  We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato and a dessert.  The soup was some sort of cream soup that was so gelatinous the spoon stood straight up in the sticky glop, yuck!  Thank God the prime rib was brought out quickly, it was FANTASTIC!  Medium rare, tender, tasty in it's own juice.  Delicious!  It's a good thing we weren't hungry for dessert, it was some sort of pudding that had the same gelatinous appearance as the soup earlier.  Gross.I've only stopped through the bakery once for some cookies.  Everything is made fresh daily and they'll take special requests for anything including sugar free and low fat items.  Go here for the meat.  I won't even buy grocery store beef since shopping here.  They'll cut anything and everything to your preferences and needs.  They are so helpful and friendly and the best part is the quality of the beef.  Everything is well marbled, fresh and fresh cut and it tastes 100 times better than anything I've bought in a grocery store.  Prices are beyond reasonable especially considering the level of service they provide.  Between this place and the Superstition Ranch Market down the street, I rarely have to shop at a grocery store.

What a find for a good old American Breakfast!  Right at Bell and 99th Ave.We went for breakfast, but their lunch/dinner menu looks pretty good too - the place ought to be featured in Diners, Driveins and Dives - tho this is certainly not a dive.I had country fried steak (made with certified Angus Beef) with sausage gravy, two eggs, fresh fruit (or hash browns) and toast for $7.99.  Jo-Ann was more conservative - two eggs. toast and hashed browns for $3.99 ($1 more on the weekend, I think).  The food was excellent.  Nothing fancy, just good food with decent serving size at a great price.Some lunch/dinner choices - 1/3 lb Angus Beef cheeseburger for $5.49, Chicken Cordon Bleu with sides for $8.99, Fish & Chips for $7.49.  I'm ready to go back!And don't let the "Sun City" stop you - this morning the ages were all over the place from teens to seniors.

A good friend of mine recommended this place.  He said it was one of the best restaurants he's been to....since he's never steered me wrong, we decided to make the drive up to Pinnacle Peak to give it a try.  I'm glad we did...It was mid-week and when we arrived, it was very slow.  We were seated in the dining room and there were only 2 other tables there.  We were beginning to wonder if we had the right place.After browsing the menu, we decided to order:Caprese (Fresh Tomato & Mozzarella Appetizer) $10.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=hD15mxhKV-yWyU9iyYSFjgCarpaccio di Manzo (Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vingarette) $11.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=BOaF8AVIQFJzYGdNXfqaVwGnocchi Ponte Vecchio (Potato Dumplings, Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce) $15.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=A0_HsEQNDFSbZinp4yoqkQRavioli di Zucca (Butternut Squash Ravioli, Walnut Gorgonzola Cream Sauce) $17.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=3OI-0dzP0xwu1KNDKg7uEgAnd for dessert....Tiramisuhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=AaXI7XufOAU0KVaXVoR7_gThe Gnocchi was amazing and the Carpaccio was awesome.  The Butternut Squash Ravioli was perfectly flavored and the sweet taste of the Squash went well with the sharp taste of the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce.Overall, it was a great meal.  What a hidden gem!  I hope they get more business so they don't close down.Return Factor - 100%

I called and ordered the country scram for breakfast & this time they got it right-2 scrambled eggs over 2 biscuits covered in sausage gravy with hashbrowns & 4 strips of bacon. $6 and they delivered!! It was good with the hashbrowns this time.Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I went to the Polaris Street Cafe for breakfast this morning.  Never judge a book by its cover!  From the outside you think, "This is the place Ben recommended?"  Once inside, it's a totally different world.  Red and white checked tablecloths on the tables, movie posters, and photos of old actors and actresses on the walls, and a very friendly staff.I took a seat and a server brought me a menu and asked about something to drink.  I ordered coffee and he brought me both coffee and a glass of ice water.  The coffee was promptly refilled while I was there.I had seen the menu online and I knew they had a good breakfast selection.  I ordered the Ranchero omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with pieces of sausage, green chilies, avocado,  cheddar cheese, and topped with a ranchero sauce.  It comes with fried potatoes and toast or biscuit.  In my case, I ordered rye toast and they asked if I wanted it buttered or not.While waiting, I was surprised by the number of calls they got for delivery.  It seemed like someone was always on the phone taking an order.  In a short time, a server brought my breakfast and asked if I wanted any hot sauce.  Cholula, of course.  I was all set.The breakfast was excellent.  Hearty and really more than I should have eaten even letting the plates go with some of the toast and potatoes unfinished.  The restaurant has three rooms.  Two larger rooms and one small room off to the north of the building.  This is a warehouse, business section of town so there are bars over the windows and on the door.  Don't be fooled by the cover.  The book is great!  Thanks Ben!  I owe you.  Maybe breakfast at the Polaris?

These hot dogs were gooood and I don't particularly care for hot dogs.  I had a chubby: mustard, grilled onions, peppers and fries. Damn it was good. I couldn't finish it though.  We split some onion rings and they were too greasy.  The dipping sauce for the onion rings was rare like all-the-condiments-in-the-fridge-mixed-together kind of rare. Don't get a chubby in the car.  Don't take your chubby home. Get a chubby there and eat it there.

Review Text :
Aside from the wait to order and the other wait to get your food, Defalco's rocks!  I was there for a late lunch on Friday and I opted to forgo my usual salad choice and go for the eggplant parm sandwich - yum!  Each bite of perfectly crusted eggplant had the most amazing tangy tomato sauce and melted cheese and it was oh so dlvine!  I had it on wheat bread and finished my entire sandwich (and yes, I ordered a full size!)  What a treat!  Don't try to special order at Defalco's - Jared attempted to create his own sandwich and what he ended up with was nothing close to what he ordered.  I can't wait to go back to 'make my own pizza' - i know about that thanks to Max A!  I have a feeling that I'll be visiting Defalco's quite a bit since I'm now living in the area after a recent move.  It's a good thing - well, it's a tasty thing, maybe not so good for the waistline!Sorry, Defalco's - I have to take a star off for you always being so slow!  Really, every time I've been, there is a long wait - and your food is worth it, but isn't there a way for you to speed things up?The register is old school and it always take forever to ring in an order... and then I have no clue what kind of system you use to prepare food and bring it out, but for the number of employees you have working, there's got to be a faster way?!Bottom line - if you are not in a hurry, and you want some good food - go to Dafalco's!I had the eggplant parmisian sub thing. Holy god. I've only been there once and it was a long time ago but I remember thinking "Why am I such a super-human moron? Why don't I eat here regularly?" Strangely, God responded. Some joke about me falling down the tree and hitting every branch. You know how it goes... I did not experience the extreme wait times that other people mention but that would really annoy me depending on my mood. Yet another reminder I'm not self-actualized.The place for lunch.I'm happy whenever I work in Scottsdale as that usually means lunch at DeFalco's.  This place is an institution in this part of town and the consistent crowds attest to its reputation.The philly cheese steak sandwich is so good that I rarely get up the courage to try something else.I guess I have to review Defalco's Italian Grocery now that Brian S has posted a pic of me loving up on a package of polenta...Brian and I rolled across the street from D'Lish and grabbed a few things at Defalco's.  I had a half steak sandwich (a grinder if you've lived north of New Haven, CT) and I'm fairly certain it was the best steak sandwich I've had since moving to Phoenix.Defalco's is the kind of place I really miss from the Boston area.  Down to earth guys, a variety of good Italian deli meats, salads, cheeses, a nice selection of Italian grocery items, and great sandwiches.If only it were closer to my house I would probably be here at least once a week.Last night my friend came over to watch the Dexter season finale and we decided to pick up food from Defalco's. We decided to each pick something and share.  I got the cheesesteak- brilliant.He got an egg salad sandwich- idiot.I was pissed I had to share with him.Seriously, never agree to share your cheesesteak.  It is just too good.   On a side note, their egg salad is just fine. It's just not that good when you have all these flavors from a cheesesteak dancing around in your mouth. Also, their sandwiches are larger than my head. I have a big head, so that is saying a lot.1/07/10My first visit here was maybe 3 or 4 years ago w/ a friend, and we'd intended to try dinner and perhaps split a pastry.  However, after looking over the dessert display case, we decided to have a pastry tasting party, instead!  My fave pastries that day (and we had sampled 6 or more, maybe 8, different varieties!) were the chocolate-chip studded cannoli and napoleon.  His was, of course, his fave Italian pastry, the sfogliatelle.  I remember it having a lemon cream filling and not enough of it.  But he was happy with it, and that's all that mattered.  Fast-forward to last month, I decided to try their stuffed shells, $9, which came w/ 5 shells, a side salad, and garlic bread.  Salad was your basic salad w/ olives and a pepperoncini, but I liked the generous portion and how fresh and crisp it felt and tasted.  The foil-wrapped garlic bread was nothing to rave about (I didn't even bother to take a picture of it after I had a bite!).  The jumbo shells were very good- loved the ricotta filling and the melty cheese on top!  However, had I known that the dish came w/ marinara sauce, I'd have requested it be omitted.  Not that it didn't taste great- it did, if not a bit too salty, but I do better w/ cream-based rather than tomato-based sauces.Can't wait to try more from the menu!(Had great pics to add here, but for some reason the "add photo" link was missing!)When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!Un@$%!ing believable cheesesteak! I just want to admit something, and I'm not ashamed about it. I went to DeFalco's two days in a row for that sammich. Seriously, it's that good. From the bread to the perfect amount of cheese, it's definitely the best cheesesteak sandwich I've had in the 5+ years that I've been here in the valley. The only thing that upsets me about it is that now I'll have a hard time trying some of the other items on the menu.From the reviews I have read, a lot of people have long waits when eating here, but I did not. I think if you can work around peak restaurant hours, you shouldn't have much of a problem. Also, the staff was pretty nice to my group and me. I'm addicted. There I said it. DeFalco's brings the East to the Southwest, and it does pretty perfectly. It's a must if you've moved from back East and want a little taste of home, or if you've never been out that way and you want a little taste of what you're missing.Bravo!10/27/10Had I not have to wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches, I'd easily give this meal 4 stars.  Looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted, I'd like to visit again soon, but recalling how long my wait was, and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook (that took my order) and another whom I thought was either an owner or a manager, I am very hesitant on returning.  :(  I did enjoy the sandwiches, especially the cheesesteak, even though half-way through my half-sandwich, I decided it was a little too salty.  I thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich, creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant!  Loved munching on the hefty wheat roll, but I didn't care much for the soft white roll that the parm rested on.Up until yesterday, I was planning on completing my draft of an effusive, glowing, 5-star review for Defalco's.  Yes, it was going to be a wonderful description of how much I love the food, blah, blah, blah...That was until I waited 35 minutes for a cheesesteak.  35 minutes.  For a sandwich.  No, it wasn't during the lunch rush.  In fact, there were only 4 other people in the store.  I walked right up to the counter to order, as there was not a line (a first!).  And then proceeded to wait.  And wait.  And wait some more.  35 minutes, to be exact, thanks to the time-stamp on my receipt.I have been to Defalco's on more occasions than I can count, and know to expect a longer than average wait.  Hey, quality takes time.  I get it.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every item I have tried there - pizza, calzone, cold sandwiches, deli items and of course my personal favorite, the cheesesteak.  My partner in culinary crime counts their food, especially their four-meat combo sandwich, among his favorite things.  Unfortunately, 35 minutes for one sandwich in a practically empty place is ridiculous enough to make me re-think my formerly 5-star opinion.This was my second time this week to experience DeFalco's. To say I was underwhelmed both times would be an understatement.The first time was when we ordered pizza for friends that were coming over for the evening. Our friends were excited because DeFalco's was a place they had heard really great things about and couldn't wait to try their food. the pizza though was just so-so. The sausage and pepperoni one was better than the vegetarian one because the meat added some flavor to the whole thing but the veggie one was bland. No one was impressed...My dad has been going here for years though and he said their sandwiches are what they are famous for so I forgave the sub-par pizza and tonight we decided to see what all the hoopla was about. I'm sorry that we did...1. I don't have a problem with surly restaurant employees... I was a surly barista for years but I have a problem with rude asshole workers. My husband and I walked up to the counter and this guy turns and complains to his co-worker about all the people coming in. Really dude??? People buying food here is what keeps you employed! He then bitches again about the same thing as I am attempting to order. AND he won't even acknowledge that I am the one ordering and will only make eye contact with my husband. Like I wasn't there. 2. My husband ordered the Greek Veggie Sandwich. We got home with the sandwich and as he was checking it out he notices that it has only one piece of feta on the whole 12 inch sandwich. And one cherry tomato on each sandwich half. The rest of it is just cucumber and onions. That's it. So he was essentially given a cucumber sandwich. Lame.3. My dad and I split a whole Combo sandwich. It was okay. Not great. I've had better sub sandwiches.  My dad says that the sandwiches were not like he remembered in the past and that this time they really seemed to skimp on the meat. In the past he and his girlfriend had split the same sandwich and it was almost too much for them both. That was not the case tonight. The only positive thing I have to say is that one of the people with us got a tuna sandwich and they said it was really great. She also thinks Top Ramon is good though so take her review as you wish.Sorry to say that I don't think I will visiting this establishment again. And my friends that wanted to try the sandwiches... I'll be encouraging them not to bother.Defalco's is half sandwich place, half italian grocery, full on tasty tasty italian flavor.I took an Arizona native here because he had never heard of it before (gasp!) even thought I believe it has several locations over Tempe-Scottsdale area. The guy at the counter suggested I try any of the hot sandwiches as they, in his opinion, have more flavor than the cold ones.I ordered a full (also available in half, but really who would ever do that) sub with sausage and peppers. The sausage is made in-house and tasted super fresh. The peppers and onions are soft and well-cooked and the toppings are swimming in a sea of marinara sauce (which is also made in house). Now the real challenge is eating it. Or, eating it without looking like a murder victim in a crime scene. I had marinara sauce in my elbows, ears, nose and any available crevice you can think of get your mind out of the gutter already). Everything came piping hot and it was incredibly filling at around $7. Score.Now on my way out I made the horrible (cough wonderful) mistake of passing by their dessert display and purchased a giant piece of caramel topped NY cheesecake (to go). I was like "Oh ill put it in the fridge and we can all share it tomorrow or something". Lies. When they all left to watch a movie (~3hrs later) I took a fork and starting nomming the creamy, thick, delicious cheesecake from Defalcos. "I'll never finish it" I thought. 30 minutes later I was starring at an empty piece of Styrofoam, with the guilt of the world on my shoulders. Damn was that cheesecake good, but I had a lot of explaining to do when the boys came home.Whatever. It was worth it.This Scottsdale institution is epic in every way. Great food, great deli, and great service. If you are in a hurry, the food can take a little while during the lunch rush, so take advantage of calling ahead of ordering so it will be ready when you get there.In addition to the great food, they have deli items for sale, specialty pasta, bread, wine, etc. Everything you need to be a hero in the kitchen. The one thing that's a bit odd are the signs on the soda fountain admonishing people not to steal soda, if they have a free water cup. That seems more like a sign you'd see in a Circle K in a shitty area- not a great deli. Maybe they can lose the sign, it kinda isn't in keeping with the classy feel of the food, ambiance and people.Everything is pleasant here from the people to the ordering to the taste of the food. I've had a Philly Cheese steak in the heart of Philadelphia and it didn't even come close to the heavenly sandwich found here at Delfalcos.Also, its HUGE! I couldn't finish mine but it was even good heated up the next day. I cant wait to come back to try their pizza and some more of their salads. They also have a large selection of wines, pastas and various other snacks so Its a great place to do some shopping for home while you wait for your food to be prepared. The owners are great, really cant wait to come back for more!I'll be honest with you. I found out about this place from my Twitter feeds. They are big Sun Devil fans and a lot of my fellow Devils stop by this place. So of course I had to bookmark and try this place. Walking in there's shelves of Italian groceries but in between are tables to sit at. Inside are usually tables for two but outside they have bigger tables. So you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. So I ordered a half meatball and half beef cheesesteak with grilled onions, peppers, and mushrooms with a Latte. I'm always looking for the best meatball sandwich in town and would have to put this at the top of my list. Freshly baked and toasted bread with two huge meatball and fresh mozzarella. Man this all came together. So good. So fresh. Loved it. The beef cheesesteak with thinly sliced ribeye was so good. The beef was so tender and juicy with that creaminess of the cheese and fresh mozzarella with peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Oh my goodness. Freaking good. Hit the spot. To top it off the latte just made this lunch to freaking over the top. Loved it. My daughter and wife split a full meatball sandwich which they couldn't finish. Plus they ordered a cannoli. Oh my goodness. We all took a bite of that cannoli it was so good. Out of this world. So creamy. So good. You just have to try this. My son ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and he really liked it. Finished it all up. I really liked this places. The tables are small but the atmosphere was great. Great food. Good and friendly service plus they are Sun Devils. So Forks Up and enjoy

Let's seee. Do I really want to watch the Charger game on a little ass plasma TV while other NFL games are shown in a room full of Dolphin (yuck), Broncos (ew), Cowboys (double ewl), and 49er fans (yikes) at a sports book back at the hotel? Orrrrrr go off the strip and chill with fellow members of the charger nation with the game projected on a big screen? Let's hop in a cab and head down to Michael's Pub. We had to bust out the GPS from the iphone to help the cab driver find this place. After declining to go to the strip club suggested by the cab driver 100 times, we finally found MP in a small strip mall. Moments after we walked up in the joint, I instantly knew we made the right choice of coming here. Charger fans everywhere, wall to wall of the small bar. During the 1st quarter, 6 Raven fans decided to come into charger territory. SD fans were really cool and respectful to them, but we had to let them know it was our house they entered. Boo birds sure gave them a warm welcome, and the chants sure made them feel uncomfortable throughout the game. "BALTIMORE: SUCKSSSS!!""RAVENS: SUCKKK!""YOU: SUCK!"I think the "GET THE FUCK OUT" Chant scared them off by halftime. Despite our 1st loss of the season, I'm sure we will meet Baltimore ravens deep in the post season! Chargers will always have the last laugh, because "THATS JUST HOW WE SPROLES!!!"CHARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!Booths everywhere. Guys and gals everywhere. Great drink specials! You can feel how everyone is "Chaaarrged" up. You can feel the electricity through the place! Excitement is everywhere....ok I'll stop talking about the stripclub, I'm supposed to be reviewing Michaels Pub.This place rocked! Felt right at home with all the Charger fans. Jerseys everywhere!GOOD:- Food and drink specials. Chicken wings, burgers, sandwiches, fries- Free food at half time!- Charger love everywhere u look- Hardcore fans, bandwagon fans, ceiling fans..they got it all!- Tvs everywhereBAD:- Small bathroom. All that beer makes you pee! Only 2 stalls- Bar located 5.5 miles off the strip (if you don't have a car, cab fare adds up)- Got pretty hot in there. All the body heat made the temperature riseUGLY:- Last two plays of the game! Can we get some better play calling please?- Can someone please block Ray Lewis!?..why he gotta smash my boy Sproles like that!- Raven fans who rolled up in there, we showed them (even though they got the last laugh)Overall, we had a blast. Being in vegas, cheering on your home team with a bunch of Charger fans is the real deal!If you ever in Vegas and want to watch a Charger game, go to Michaels Pub! exSPROLESive!!!

Restaurant name  La Palapa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
La Palapa is a Mexican seafood restaurant on the north side of town offering incredibly fresh underwater fare at incredibly affordable prices. I insist that you start with a Modelo Especial served michelada style, or 'preparado' ($4). This is a light Mexican beer laced with hot sauce and fresh lime juice, served ice cold in a massive salt rimmed goblet. Sounds strange, I know, but once you try it you'll be hooked. I actually had a similar drink served to us in a plastic cup at the HUGE Broadacres swap meet on the north end LVB, which I also recommend for delicious cheap eats, but this is the first time (and certainly not the last) I've had it in a restaurant.Then, you should order the fish taco ($3). This was primarily desirable to me because of the price, but once it came to the table I knew I wouldn't be let down. It needed a shot of acidity (may I recommend their house salsa, a dash of Tapatio, and a squeeze of lemon?) but the beer battered fish was hot, crispy, and oh so good.The entree of shrimp served "a la palapa" (I love saying their name, try it!) came to the table looking one note and blonde, and not in the appealing sort of way men like. I was amazed, however, after taking the first bite of snappy, sweet shrimp. It was flavored with bay leaves and some sort of dried pepper, and tasted fantastic, especially when bundled up in a warm tortilla with their great refried beans and rice.I also very much enjoyed the combination tostada of octopus (pulpo) and shrimp (camaron) ($3.75). There aren't many places outside of the Mediterranean you can get great octopus, but this was fantastic considering our desert surroundings. It was tender, yet firm, and very fresh. In fact, none of the seafood I've had here has been anything but fresh, so if you like offerings of the sea but don't want to drown in debt, La Palapa should be on your 'must visit' restaurant list.PS. Do you like flan? Then don't pass on dessert. La Palapa's version is as creamy as cheesecake. I'm generally a poster child for self-restraint when it comes to over-indulging in foods that are very bad for you (I'm part foodie, part health nut), but I can only attribute that to my strict evaluation of whether or not something is worth the calories. The flan here most certainly is, so I left only a token bite.

Villa was our third choice for lunch today. The other two were closed. I am glad they were. Ryan C and I arrived -slightly after- 12:00 because he is always -slightly after- whenever he is supposed to be there, and there was a healthy crowd but plenty of room to sit. There are about 10 tables with about 4 seats a piece. They have a great selection of Boars head meats but the kicker is the bread. Made fresh daily. it really can make a huge impact on the food. I opted for the spaghetti and meatballs dinner with salad and bread. They were out of something for the salad, so I ended up with Ala carte. It was a nice portion of spaghetti and two meat balls. The MB were not huge but not too small either, about 1.5 to 2 inches round. They were homemade and tasted great. No mushy texture just great seasonings. The sauce was excellent. Nice flavor and they didn't skimp om the sauce. I had to have something for the bread to soak up. The bread was a slightly smaller then a softball sized roll. Great crust and soft interior. The bread could have been warmed up to allow the cold butter to spread but I will ask them next time. One cool thing is they have kits for pizza and for pasta. Sort of a do it yourself thing. The pizza could be a fun time for kids or creative adults just the same. I grabbed a frequent diner card because I will be back.Dig it.  3.5 stars.  The chicken parm was decent portion for decent price, but I'm not getting my friend's Italian gramma on the phone or anything.The sauce was the best part, sweet and basily.The daily fresh baked bread (they call a Smiley) was great, but should have been served warm, not fridge cold, in order to appreciate its flavor and texture.  I will go back, but I will have to try out some other items, such as the array of hot or cold sammiches, before I can say I'm a fan.Reading the history of the place on the back of the menu was a little dry, until getting to the part about some poor schlepp who got shot in the restaurant in a previous location and then a few years later plummeted his car over a cliff edge.  Weird.

I come here at least once a week for my lunch break. They have lunch specials from 11am-3pm ranging from $6-$8, but I come here for the Combination Pho. I think it's the best dish they offer. This is probably the only place that serves Pho on this side of town.Call ahead to order your food, because they take a long time.this place is a joke... I came in and ordered 2 smoothies and they made me wait 25 minutes for 2 drinks... they gave us a straw that had sticky substance on it... WTF. it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies weren't even tasty. NEVER COMING BACK.This restaurant rates. #1 on the worst Chinese fast food list in the country. I have lived in many places and in many states and this "restaurant" is the worst. We ordered Crab Rangoon & General Tso chicken. The crab rangoon was very small, overcooked and had a smear of who knows what in it. The General Tso chicken had something that resembled paint thinner and smelled like it too. The chicken was the cheapest quality a restaurant could buy. For fear of spending the weekend in the hospital I stuck to the overcooked crab rangoon and some rice. I was desperate!If you have the iron stomach and complete lack of taste buds to try the food here you might want to avoid the duck sauce. That was nastier than the paint thinner, er the chicken.You know a place is not doing so well when they offer deals that are too good to be true. Free eggroll with yelp check-in and buy one get one free drink? We paid less than $10 and ended up with 2 drinks and a box of eggroll. SERVICEI was disgusted by the rude servers here. They seemed nice at first but as soon as they saw me check-in on yelp, they kept demanding me to write a review for them. No.I sat down at one of their sticky and nasty table then they yelled out "you write review? I need to see it" When I went to the counter to pick up my order, they snatched my phone from my hands and started scrolling through my yelp profile. "where is the review? you didn't write it? omg no why" First of all, you have no right to touch my belonging and second of all, it's invasion of my privacy for you to be looking through my phone. I am done with their trashy and unprofessional employees. FOOD/DRINKSI don't know what their vegetable eggroll was made out of but it was inedible. Straight to trash. Boba milk tea? or did they mistake this for sugar milk tea? perhaps they added a whole bag of sugar in my 24oz milk tea because I didn't write a review? Either way, I could not drink this. I went home, dumped half of the milk tea, added water and I was finally able to drink this. Took a sip then went straight to trash.Boba was a disgusting mush and had absolutely no flavor or chew.CONCLUSION Never again. Avoid at all cost.

Restaurant name  Doña Maria Tamales Restaurant

Review Text :
When trying to decide where to catch the  World Cup game and enjoy lunch central to both our locations, my husband and I settled on Dona Maria. We sat at the bar and ordered a diet coke and my pregnancy drink of choice, raspberry ice tea. The staff was courteous enough, although we waited about 10-15 for the menus to be brought over. The complimentary chips and salsa tasted very complimentary -stale chips and salsa that tasted like marinara sauce. We opted for 6 tamales (pork, beef, cheese, chicken x2 and "sweet").  I had beef and chicken, and thought they were ok but slightly dry. I had to drench them in cholula sauce for added moisture.  Also the tamales were relatively small. The tab was close to $25 which is pretty standard for a mid range quality restaurant. I'd say this was purely a convenience thing and based on the food I would have no desire to go back.

The man and I stopped in here last night.  We were starving and beer and pub food sounded just right.I didn't know what I wanted to drink, but I wanted to try something different.  Jeff, our server, helped me out by asking what I like (I typically drink amber ales and some lighter beers that aren't too hoppy) and he brought out a sample of Boont Amber.  It was really delicious, but I was in the mood for something a little lighter.  This time he came back with Wittekerke, a light Belgian Witbier.  It was very tasty and I went with that and my guy got the Orange Blossom Hefe which was excellent also.The food seems to be centered around the pizzas.  Since we were starving and pizzas require 25 minutes (as stated on the menu) we opted for some sliders and a chicken quesadilla.  The sliders were just so-so for me.  They were hard to bite with the meat being so thick and it also wasn't easy to get a bite without having to eat the whole beef piece.  The quesadilla could have been the best I've had - especially with their homemade salsa on the side.  They had other apps and some sandwich selections, but it would have been nice to see a few burgers on there.  Maybe they don't have the equipment.  Who knows...The only slight bummer was the service.  Service for beer was fantastic, but the service for food was only so-so.  It was a pretty low key Wednesday night with not many patrons and it took a while to get a food order in.I love how you can shop from the fridge and even get half gallons of their own brews to go.  They carry the Ephemere Apple which I tried a while ago and enjoy also.  The 30 beers on draft can change daily, so there is always something new to try.  There are an enormous amount of brew options and I can't wait to go back and check 'em out.Who knew that Papago Brewing was hiding in the Papago Plaza just a couple of miles from where i live?  Not me!  I met my new friend Brian M at Papago Brewing Company for a beer yesterday (Friday) around 5pm.  He was sitting at the bar waiting for me when I walked in... and just as I sat down next to him, Jess (the friendly bartender) came over to see what I was drinking.  I told her what I liked, and she brought me a cool tall glass of Orange Blossom, a light American Wheat Ale flavored with Mandarin Orange and Vanilla.  They compare it to a liquid old fashioned creamsicle.  It hit the spot and believe it or not, it gave me a nice buzz too!  Yes, I am a light weight!Jess also brought over a sample of a black cherry beer that I cannot for the life of me remember the name of.  It was sweet and delicious.I'm not a huge beer drinker, but after seeing Beer Wars and now seeing the variety of craft beers that Papago has to offer, I may become one soon.  Well - maybe I should wait until after the wedding - a beer bellied bride probably wouldn't be so cute?!The beer selection for take out is awesome too - next time I need to bring beer somewhere, I'll head to Papago for sure!  If you're looking for a comfortable place to go have a beer, head to Papago... tell Jess I say hello!Mmmmm, the orange blossom beer is worth the trip every time. I dream of this beer. It's like if Blue Moon beer and an orange creamscicle had a baby. The food is also yummy too. Not your typical bar food which I like. My only complaint is that I wish they would serve a cheese dip with the big, soft pretzel instead of mustard. This place gets pretty packed and is loud, so don't expect to carry much of a conversation with anyone. I think this place is a good hang out spot that has a wonderful and large beer selection and great food. I just wish I would have frequented this place more often when I lived in the neighborhood.I really like Papago for the variety - 30 beers on tap and God knows how many in the refrigerator cases. All can be consumed on-site or brought home to stock your personal inventory. What I especially dig is how knowledgeable the staff are about the beer -- even the ones who barely look old enough to drink! I've learned a lot already, from the different types of beer glasses to how some beers are aged and discovering what I like! You can play darts or any of the many board games they've got out. We played Yahtzee on one recent visit. There's a jukebox and a TV for further distraction. The food is OK. Nothing spectacular. Ball park pretzels, thin pizza crust with sauces for dipping, quesadillas, pizzas, etc. There are severely limited options for non-beer drinkers (like 4-5 mediocre wines to chose from and canned/bottled sodas). That said, if you're willing to explore the world of beer - this HAS to be your first stop!**Ladies** try the Lambic Black Cherry Ale. It's so good- and so is the Rasberry Framboise.  This is a cool spot when you want to be casual, and get friendly service. It satisfies my monthly dive bar craving.Wow. This place is superb. It is hard to notice it if you are driving by, and unless you take the leap in and just go for it, you would think its a dive... Oh, but Papago is hardly that!~Fud/DrinkOn my second visit, I had the Orange Blossom beer. I didn't have it the first time, because I was an idiot. Being a non-idiot, I quickly ordered a pint, which subsequently went into my belly super quick. This is my personal favorite beer, no question about it. It is refreshing, yet smooth, has no bite or acidic after taste, and is great by itself or with a dish. Speaking of dishes, they make some mighty tasty bar food. I had a pizza on the first visit, which filled me up and was exceptional. On the most recent visit, I had the red pepper hummus, which surprised me in its above-par flavor. There is a variety of dishes available, all which will fill you up and give your beer a good stomach-fellow. They have so many beers on tap, you would be a fool not to find at least one that suits your fancy. This is a must-go for any beer fan, you will be very satisfied with the options in front of you.~Atmosphere/Service~Like I said, it seemed at first like a dive, being in a strip center without much signage, minus the outside glass job they did to the store-front. Inside is a lot of wood, which gives you the feel for an old-school bar and a Midwestern  feel. It feels inviting, and there more than enough space for you and some friends to chill at. There is also a side room I did not notice until now, that is available if there is a large crowd, so space issues aren't a concern. As for service, it seems to be about average. After waiting about 4 minutes for a server to come to me I simply walked up and ordered instead of waiting and getting upset. Eventually a seat opened up at the bar and the server helped me when I asked for another type of beer. They seem a bit busy, so you do have to ask for their attention. The waitstaff aren't rude, they just seem semi-attentive. I will service gauge this a bit more as I continue to come back. Overall, I am satisfied :)~Extras/Rating~I must suggest finding a seat at the bar if you are coming with another friend. It seems to mean much quicker service and also gives you an idea about selection of beers of course. Please also note the HUGE selection of carry-out beers they have in front of the bar itself. A huge huge selection, which is great if you are not near a Total Wine but want to select your own craft beer six pack. The bonus over Total Wine is that they are all cold! One sad downside is that they only serve the Orange Blossom in a Growler, no six pack avail for any of their beers. Oh well! Five Stars goes out to this place for the quality beers, inviting atmosphere, the tasty bar food that tastes fresh,  the large selection of take out beers, and for the best beer of them all: The Orange Blossom! This is the best brewery I have been to in AZ, its to be determined if another one can carry the weight that Papago has. Come and enjoy!

Review Text :
KUNG FU KICKED TO 2 STARS   Kung Fu Restaurant broke an important rule. That rule is to NEVER EVER force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check. Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating.   Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.  The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus.   Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table.   The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill.   I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, "The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business." Or the fortune cookie might of said, "You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city." Or the fortune cookie could of said, "There is nothing like competition." To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time.Must have passed this place a million and one times over the last ten years since I came to town and never stopped in. Heard good things about it and fellow colleagues always go, so today me and Ellen F. decide to check it out. Located on the southwest corner in the strip mall on Valley View and Spring Mountain, can't miss it with a name like Kung Fu on the outside. We were seated right away, place wasn't too busy so a waiter took our drink orders promptly. The place looks old school but don't care about that, has a lot of Thai decor with elephants and pictures of the motherland. I get the feeling this place is geared more toward Thai than Chinese but who knows. If you want pad Thai don't fall for the trap and order it from the menu as they offer it as a lunch special for $6.95 Mon-Fri 11am-3pm. I fell for this and ordered the combo pad Thai with an order of rice, it was huge!! Enough for two people. I doubt the lunch portion is as big but still much cheaper and comes with soup or an egg roll. The pad Thai was very good, along with the rice, the quantity was more than enough and the bill was reasonable. We will be returning during lunch hours to take full advantage of the specials. If your looking for a cheap meal in Chinatown with no frills it's worth a stop.

Review Text :
Ha ha. The reviews here are hilarious. So my ex bf and I always go to La Perla. We have drinks and dance the night away here. We are usually the only non Mexicans in the group. When we first started dating, I thought what the hell am I doing here. It grew on me and I love it. The bartenders don't even speak English! We have a fun, unpretentious night here. People are nice and you see another side of life, instead of the typical Scottsdale places I usually frequent. It makes me remember who I am and that I can have a blast anywhere.La Perla Café is family owned/operated and has been around for YEARS. I went there with my wife Carol for dinner. Carol got the #23 combo (Tostada, enchilada & a taco) she totally devoured her meal so I know she liked it. When she was done there was nothing left on her plate. I got the Cimichanga dinner w/ rice and refried beans. My entrée was mouthwatering scrumptious. It was well-prepared, flavorful and came out sizzling hot. OMG, the food is SO GOOD here, all the way down to their terrific salsa!  Every bite of it was just stellar!Outstanding Mexican comfort food. Excellent service from Sandra, our waitress. This place is has excellent food and the prices are reasonable in addition the quality is top notch.One of the other greatest parts of the meal was the 3 different salsas they serve with their home made chips. They come in small carafes with the food.  All three salsa were extremely flavorful in a way totally unique to La Perla Café. Their salsa unlike most places is less spicy and more flavorful. Its also not so thick. If you love Mexican food you really owe it to yourself to check out La Perla. FOOD: Top quality Mexican food - MUY DELICIOSO!!! SERVICE: The people are very nice, helpful and caring. They truly want you to enjoy the food they make for you. PRICE: Comparable to other Mexican restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. CONCLUSION: AMAZING FAMILY OWED MEXICAN RESTAURANT! A truly wonderful establishment. I cant believe how long its been around and how nice and hospitable everyone there was. I love supporting independent, family run business.

We order from Apple Spice here at the office at least once per week. It started out just one or two of us, and has grown into five or six, surely more to jump on board! They do these things called "box lunches" where you get a side (pasta/potato/frog eye salad or chips), a pickle, a treat (normally a cookie) and condiments including mustard, mayo, lettuce and tomato. The wide variety of sandwiches are either 6.95 or 7.95 and include all of the above. If you are an Amazon, or just eat like one (Me, that's right, guilty as charged) you can get the "executive box" for $2 more... and it includes all of the above PLUS a side of veggies (carrots, broccoli, celery, black olives, etc) with a side of ranch, a bag of chips and cheesecake.!!!! So, for $8.95 I am stuffed out of my mind and so happy because the egg salad that I get every time is always moist and flavorful, and I really love the sourdough bread it comes on! Some of the other girls from the office religiously order the Roast Beef Deluxe and Breast of Turkey, as well. f you order a minimum of three lunches before 10:30am, they will deliver for you :) We normally don't start thinking about lunch until then, so we always forget, but we call and place the order and its ready for pickup about fifteen minutes later. Easy! I would definitely use them for catering should the need arise! Way to go Apple Spice!!

I've driven past this place several times and finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  After browsing their menu, I decided to order:Carne Asada Burrito, $4.75http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw#eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJwBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $4.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ#WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQWhile I waited for my food, I went to load up on Salsa.  They have a typical Salsa Bar that you find out here in the Phoenix area Taco shops.  I tried the spicy Salsa and the roasted Peppers Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA#qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg#AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQgAfter a short wait my food was ready.  The Burritos are pretty large and come with Chips...that was an unexpected bonus.  Before I jumped into the Burritos, I tried the Chips...they were stale, yuck.I then went for the Carne Asada Burrito....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  There was very little flavor to it.  Ok, another bite....and then another.  Wow, this was the blandest Carne Asada Burrito I've ever had.  Another unique thing was that the Burrito had grilled Onions and Salsa in it....very runny for a Burrito like this.  However, that didn't help with the flavor at all.  As a matter of fact, I only ate 1/2 of it.Next, I tried the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito....again, it was underwhelming and bland.  I poured the spicy Salsa and Roasted Peppers Salsa on it to give it some flavor....that was it's only saving grace.Overall, it was a very disappointing dining experience.  Oh well, it happens sometimes.Return Factor - 2%

If you want an authentic experience, if you really want to feel like you have some manner of ethnic experience, you need to come to Haji Baba.  It's a little middle-eastern market.  It's a corner grocery.  It's a family-run restaurant.  It's freaking good.  The hummus is pretty good, with fresh-made pita.  The feta cheese app is really good.  The chicken shawerma plate is top-notch, and my god is there a ton of food.  Heck, order the gyros plate for around $6 and when it arrives, mounds of succulent meat, tzsaziki sauce, rice and Greek salad, go ahead and take a bite before you decide to pull a Johnny Depp from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and go back to kill the cook because it's just too good.  It's cheap, it's filling, it's quality, and it's ridiculous that it's not packed from open to close.  Good ol' Haji Baba.You know when you absolutely adore a restaurant and it's like they don't even know you exist? Like you're in some endless John Hughes film where you never, ever get to that final birthday cake scene? I hate unrequited love. But at Haji Baba, the feeling's alllll mutual, baby. No, really. They love me. I swear. Stop laughing. The bestest service, the nicest chitchat and the friendliest not-creepy flirting. And, of course, the most delicious hummus (with a pickle on top).OK, so maybe everyone gets the hummus. But does everyone get a big smile and a compliment from the kitchen staff? Maybe it's because I always stop by after work, gussied up in heels and other lady-things. Maybe it's because I tip on takeout orders. Always. Or maybe it's just because I shop the store like I mean it: canned goods, feta, olives, pita, maybe some naan, baklava, wacky Eastern European chocolate, baba ganoush, spices, pistachios, etc. etc. etc. Not to mention the dirt-cheap, super-tasty kebab, shwarma and koubideh. And while Haji Baba may be the Sam Schoeffling to my Molly Ringwald, Long Duk Dong has never made an appearance during my meal.If you have yet to come to Haji Baba's, then you may not know why almost everyone is in consensus that this place is the bee's knees. I have yet to meet someone who has came to Haji Baba, and been disappointed..in fact I hope i never meet that person, cause they probably suck.HB is THE best place to get mediterranea/middle eastern food. It's fast authentic and cheeeeaaaaappp!The gyros and falafel will run you about ohh idk $2-$3Everything on the menu is under or slightly hovering around/above $10you can come here on a beggars budget and feast like a Turkish Sultan!conveniently located along the lightrail, deliciously prepared like your eating at your grandma's house, and so ridiculously affordable.The market side of HB's is full of goodies as well, be sure to browse on your way out/in.hands down "woohoo! as good as it gets!"i recommend making the people you go with order several things so you can have a bite of everything.everything is good. so good. i think the gyro meat was my favorite, their pitas are so fluffy and soft... like little cushions from heaven sent to earth with the sole purpose of harnessing that delicious meat. i can't even remember everything we had but i know i liked every bite and you will too. we had like 3 days of left overs as well, but we went a little over board in our ordering.If you've ever gyros hopped before, you know that not all gyros are created equal, and until today; if asked, I would have told you my favorite gyros is at Cypress Grill. I am happy to report, opinion changed!I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble. I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of "Personal Favorite - thus far" on it. I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother "Gyros" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)Happy Yelping Phoenix - break outside your bubble once in a while and you'll be surprised at what you can find!

Review Text :
One of my fave t-shirts reads "Spooning Leads to Forking." That said, all I can say, is that whatever leads me back to the Roaring Fork is OK with me. A sprawling, rustic space with antler chandeliors (pahleeze, I can't spell that) and a roaring fireplace serving up fantastic New American fare. A perfect spot for a post movie double date. Let's start off in reverse by reviewing the desserts....The banana split, with fried bananas would make even a monkey cry with ecstacy. We were fighting for the last bite. Entrees of roasted duck with sour cherry sauce and sauteed cabbages was delectible. I ate, seriously, every bite. Rickie's fried chicken was juicy and crisp. The seared Ahi tuna with fresh avocado was perfectly prepared. Appetizer fish tacos were fresh, clean and light. All pre dinner salads were crisp and tossed in fantastic dressings. My field green salad, however, was short on beets and the fried goat cheese a bit gummy and luke warm. Service was polite, friendly, although I would enjoy a little more spark and verve from the staff. She seemed like she was sleep walking. Wine list was extensive. Crowd was very family like this evening, with lots of holiday revelery and gift exchange. Great spirited vibe all around. Can't wait to go back. Perhaps I'll wear my t-shirt. Perhaps the server will wake up.Roaring Fork, oh Roaring Fork.  How do I love thee?  Let me counts the ways....1.....  Okay, I guess I don't really love you.  But I do like you, okay? First off, what an interesting location.  I could have been killed getting in the parking lot.  I had a reservation for 8:30.  No, my table wasn't ready at 8:30.  I found that very interesting because there was no one waiting in the lobby.  And wouldn't you know, they seated me by the kitchen.  Okay, folks, I know how long your food was sitting there Friday night and it's not pretty.  Their staff is like a bunch of crazy lunatics, but that's okay.I opted for the Huckleberry Margarita, nice but nothing to write home about.  Doesn't begin to compare with Roy's signature drink, but that's for another review.The bread basket was full of unhealthy little taste treats, I especially liked the bacon & cornmeal bombs and the buttermilk, bacon, artery cloggers.  Yum, yum, even better slathered in chipotle honey butter.  My salad was great, I opted for the wild greens disguised as the iceberg wedge.  I'm a red meat girl, so I had the 8 oz. center cut filet mignon.  Eight is too much for any girl, so I was unable to finish.  But I did order it medium and since it was barely medium rare, I did have to send it back.  Luckily, I was close to the kitchen, so the re-cook didn't take long.  The flavor of the meat wasn't really remarkable, but satisfactory.  The green chile Mac 'n' Cheese is a really great idea and something that I will try to duplicate at home.  If any of you yelpers have the recipe, I would be interested in it.  Now, I'm thinking that since I didn't finish my steak, my server deemed me not worthy of a dessert, it wasn't even offered!  But that's okay, I guess I didn't really need it.All in all, pleasant, but nothing to write home about.Based on the Roaring Fork happy hour last night, I had to update my review, and it was another 5 star experience for sure.  I met my boyfriend there around 6pm, and we waited just about 10 minutes until two seats opened up at the bar... The entire bar area was packed though - it's no secret how fantastic the happy hour prices are at RF!The bar service was perfect - (thanks Ryan) and for a total of $33 before tip, we walked out full from the following:-a glass of Cab Sauv ($5)-a field greens salad with fresh beets, apples, candied walnuts and goat cheese ($5)-fish tacos that came with avocado, tomato, lettuce, salsa ($7)-a half roasted chicken that came with beans, tortillas, avocado, and additional garnish ($12) We were completely satisfied, ambiance was fun (we made friends with our neighbors on either side), and food was phenomenal!  Helpful hint we were told for next time - if you order the salad and ask them to split it in the kitchen, they will put a full goat cheese fritter on both plates!  We're already planning to order that way next time!Thanks for another fantastic meal, Roaring Fork - see you again soon!My experience at the Roaring Fork during Restaurant Week was peculiar.  It's difficult for me not to take on the judgements of my co-diners, but I'm going to try to limit this to my experience only.It took FOREVER to get order our drinks and actually receive them.  All I wanted was an iced tea and I received my drink last, and it was given to my co-diner seated 4 seats away from me.  And, while we were waiting for our drinks to arrive incredibly slowly and one-by-one, I started to get really, really hungry.  I'm waiting for the guy to take our order, but he hasn't even brought all the drinks yet, but he has brought a huge basket of bread.  So I start munching on bread, which was so-so.Finally, he takes our orders for appetizer and entree.  And it takes forever for something of which they probably have a big vat sitting in the kitchen.  But it eventually comes out: 7 green pork chili and a tortilla soup. Except wait a minute, they only brought out 6 green pork chili and a tortilla soup.  So again I wait, and wait, for my waiter to come check on us. 10 minutes or longer after everyone else is served I finally get my appetizer.And it was really good. Tender pieces of pork in a slightly spicy green chili sauce, smothered with a ton of jalapeno jack cheese, served in a little cauldron with three large buttery tortillas.  But it was enough food to be the entree.  If I had known it was going to be this large, I would have ordered the salad.Then it takes awhile for everyone to finish, plates to be cleared and entrees to be brought out.  We were seated at 7:30, it's now close to 9.But then it finally arrives.  My rainbow trout with almond slices and capers with a piece of jalapeno cornbread.  The fish was almost as large as the platter, easily 4 servings if vegetables were included on the platter, but there wasn't.  I'm very curious to find out if this is how they normally serve their food because I'm not used to getting a big plate of meat with nothing else.  Again, it was delicious.  Lightly battered and smokey, it almost tasted meaty it was so rich. This fish was yummerriffic.Then it's time for the dessert, not that any of us have room for dessert, but it's part of the package.  The server informs us that there are only 3 creme brulee left.  Luckily only two of our crowd wanted this dessert, but it was just another way that I was a little disappointed with the service.  I ordered the Chocolate Lava Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was pretty good.  Not phenomenal, but good.I loved my food, and maybe I would check out a happy hour.  It's a shame that the service was so mediocre, because this restaurant could easily have won me over with their food.  And I never would have gone here if it wasn't Restaurant Week.I was so excited to try Roaring Fork for the first time given the positive reviews.  My husband and I met a group of Yelpers for the first time as well.  While we thoroughly enjoyed the company, the restaurant...not so much.Service was marginally acceptable.  While our server took our water order right away, it took a ridiculous amount of time to order any other drinks (except for water) and even a more obscene amount of time to get our dinner order taken.  Where the hell was he?  Taking a class at the Culinary Institute down the street?  There was no logical progression of the dining experience or even the ordering process.  Finally, Houdini arrives with bread.  The  dinner rolls were decent.  There were also some kind of bacon biscuit, but the flavor reminded me more of those "Baco" bacon bits than smokey good-quality bacon.  I ordered off the Restaurant Week menu.  For my starter, I had the green chili pork stew.  Very very good.  Quite a large portion for a starter-would be a fabulous lunch.  Because I wanted to save room for dinner, I refrained from finishing the stew.  Big mistake as my rotisserie chicken was a disappointment.  While it wasn't bad, the chicken was a little dry and  relatively flavorless.  I spent most of my meal focusing on my fond memories of the green chili stew I so foolishly let go.  I did try my husband's trout and it was delicious.  Damn I hate it when he gets a better dish than I do.  The lava brownie for dessert was good, but not as warm as I would have expected either.  I think it was nearing breakfast hour by the time we managed to complete our meal.I'm not certain if the lack-luster experience was due to Restaurant Week or our server lost the coin toss when our group pushed our two tables together.  I will come back and give Roaring Fork another shot, however.  Maybe Houdini will have disappeared for good.  Ahhh, he wasn't that bad, very nice, just not on top of things.I had the opportunity to dine with some Fabulous Fellow Yelpers at The Roaring Fork last night. While the night was fun and full of laughs, The Fork just didn't deliver.Our group of 9 people had a dinner reservation for 7:30pm. Let me first hit on our reservation. Because of seating limitations, Jenn W and I had to make 2 separate reservations, and they were made through Open Table. We each noted our reservation with each other's names and stated that we wanted to be seated next to each other. I also noted that we were Yelp members and that we wanted the AZ Restaurant Week menu.  We received a confirmation etc.The day of our event, I received a phone call confirming our 8PM dinner...umm... no. I explained I set it for 7:30. The girl fumbled around and finally said "Yeah ok." and finally apologized for the oversight. I am SO glad I thought to ask her about the further instructions regarding Jenn W and My table being seated together, because they would have dropped the ball on that too. In my irritation, I finally said "What other important information do you miss because you guys don't actually read your Open Table reservations?" more apologies...yack yack.Fast forward to dinner time!I arrived around 7pm to meet a few Yelpers for drinks at the bar. I didn't feel comfortable actually sitting at the bar because the seats are jam packed right next to each other... heaven forbid there's a fire! It took a while for the bartender to notice that we actually wanted a drink. He served me a fantastic Zin. I don't know what it was, but it was good!Our full party arrived and it was dinner time! I was STARVING at that point. We were seated at 2 separate tables that were next to each other. We decided it was silly to sit a foot away from each other and put some muscle into moving our tables together. Our server, Joshua, took our water order very quickly. Unfortunately, that was about all he did quickly and accurately all night. Our actual drink/cocktail order was painfully slow both in being able to order it and delivery, plus a random diet coke showed up in the midst of our order. At this point we didn't want our drinks we wanted food. A couple of bread baskets were delivered with so-so varieties of bread. My favorite was the cheddar bacon biscuit. It was just interesting to me. After we depleted our carb baskets, we hoped that our food order would fare better and get to us quickly.It was time for the first course. Everyone's first course was delivered except for one. Jenn W was left to sit and wait an unreasonable amount of time for her order. In fact, instead of making sure everyone had what they needed, our waiter delivered another table's appetizer first and walked away. BIG NO NO. Jenn finally received her order and I could finally dig into my food without guilt. I ordered the green chile stew. Fantastic! I loved it. It had the right amount of spicy kick. The meat was tender and not at all fatty, and the tortillas that came with it were hot and buttery. I could have just gone straight to dessert after that. I was very pleased with my appetizer.What goes up must come down right? Well my blissful high was broken up by my boring rotisserie chicken meal. I was hoping that the chicken might be moist and smoky, or maybe rubbed with some interesting spices... no. I know I've had a better seasoned, and more moist rotisserie chicken from a grocery store. Yes, I said it. I did have the chance to steal bites of the trout from Jenn W and Matthew K. How I regret ordering the chicken!! The trout was moist and meaty and full of so much flavor it was silly!! I also had a few bites of Amanda B's short rib dish. The sauce on the short rib was tasty and smoky; the short rib itself was almost too fatty. I know short ribs are supposed to have some fat content, but this was like eating blubber in some bites, not appetizing. I had high hopes for my dessert.Our dinner dishes were finally cleared away and we were left to chat for a bit before our dessert order was taken. I had the molten chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Meh... the brownie wasn't exactly as molten as I expected and considering my ice cream was largely melted I was hoping the whole brownie was warm, nope. The melted ice cream was possibly our "speedy" waiter's handiwork.Our waiter was kind enough to allow split bills and there was no problem in mixed up tabs or anything which was great. I think I will go back to the Roaring Fork for a happy hour or to try some of their more creative dishes. Maybe a basic chicken dish threw them for a loop; I hope they can wow me next time with something different!Happy hour was hopping today, unlike last week.  Bartender Ryan wasn't there, but no worries, as Stefan was just as able and gracious.  I selected the cab to go with the RF "Big Ass Burger," even though I wanted to try the zin.  Did I choose wrong?  I'll try the zin next time.Since I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).If only there are more happy hour meal selections (only two, excluding the salads) for me to enjoy.  Guess I'll be forced to try the Huckleberry bread pudding with creme anglaise and vanilla bean ice cream next time... woe is me ;)How does a fork roar?There is a certain zen quality to that question, much like the ever popular "if a tree falls, yada-yada" (I know, it's not really yada-yada, but you get the idea).I have been to several restaurants lately named with utensil based nomenclature, or named after the place in which the meal was prepared (Kitchen, Wok, etc.). I fully expect that trend to continue, but I think it shows a certain lack of imagination. Sometimes that can be helpful, like "Jimmy's BBQ Pit"...I know it's likely to be BBQ. Simply "Jimmy's Pit" or "Jimmy's" or "Pit" wouldn't be helpful (well, "Pit" might tell you avoid the place). But generally, I like a little romance in the naming...a little something to pique my interest (having said that I still think the food at Hooters is just not up to the name, but that's a discussion for another time).The Beautiful Carin and I headed over to the Roaring Fork for Happy Hour a couple of nights ago and spent a lovely evening at the bar with Clark, the bartender/server/happy hour ambassador. The bar is the place to have a happy hour dinner and couple of cocktails. Tables are fine, but the bar is just a better atmosphere! We hadn't been back for happy hour since Bob McGrath sold the place, but it really hasn't changed (which is a good thing!!). All of our favorites are still solidly on the menu, and the Big Ass Burger is still riding tall at the Roaring Fork Happy Hour! We started with the green chile pork stew and scotch (why yes, they do have one of my favorites...Bunnahabhain...that always puts me in a good mood!).I had the Big Ass Burger... it truly is a big ass burger and really tasty...it's not Kobe beef, it's just beef, but good beef, cooked correctly! Carin had the Roasted Chicken which was also really well prepared...crispy skin, moist and flavorful! We couldn't begin to eat it all, so DeeDee was delighted with us when we got home:)For the capper, they have started making their own pies, in their wood fired oven. You know what's better than chocolate pecan pie in homemade crust (yeah baby, none of the store bought crap for these Roaring Forkers)...almost nothing! Sex, that's about it.Jeez, I waddled out of there, $50 lighter, but that's a hell of a meal for $50, (including a couple of single malts, a marti and dessert)!So, how does a fork roar? It roars for thee my friend, it roars for thee.I came here for happy hour and left a happy camper. Everything on the menu sounded great and we finally decided on the queso con carnitas and the big ass burger. The appetizer was very flavorful the only thing I didn't like is that there was more meat than queso so it was kind of hard to eat. The big ass burger was the best burger I have ever had. It came with chipotle mayo that wasn't very flavorful but the burger didn't need anything added on to it. The meat was amazing and melted in your mouth. I ate half of the burger and was full for the rest of the night.I like green chile. I like mac and cheese. So, clearly I'm ordering green chile mac and cheese. And luckily I'm enjoying it immensely thanks to Roaring Fork. Other foods I tried included the white bean soup (made with a pork base which made it pretty much delicious) and shrimp and grits. Were these any old grits you ask? Funny you ask because no is the answer. They were corn grits, which sounds odd and is mighty tasty.The atmosphere here is warm and cabin-y. It seems like a great place to scoot in close to your date and get involved in a romantic dinner. Equally, I saw a few ladies groups there toasting each other with glasses of wine and sharing appetizers. It's one of those places that most groups don't feel out of place in.Overall, I'd say this is a bit of an upscale place, but not so fancy that you have to save it for special occasions. Unless, you're like me and treat everyday like a special occasion. ;-)When I got here what was roaring was my stomach! It had been a long day and after unwinding a tad at the Fairmont we headed here for a special birfday dinner. We hung out in the bar area while waiting for our table. Immediate service... woot. woot. What? Table ready early? woot. woot. woot. Drinks were brought to our table and we examined the menu. I was having a difficult time deciding on what to get until I saw the RF Mixed Grill... Baby Back Ribs, Bacon wrapped Quail and Prawns. Roasted Corn side with a dollop of mashed potatoes.. look no further I am sold. The prawns were slightly over cooked but that did not bother me as the quail was friggin awesome. I am noticing a bacon theme here in Scottsdale and I endorse it 125%. The boyfriend got the teriyaki cedar plank salmon which was inhaled in seconds. The lamb shank is ridiculously huge... it looks like a turkey leg on steroids. I had a bite and it was also well cooked (not super gamy in taste). The grilled asparagus side is huge and can easily be shared between 2-3 people. Dessert... Creme Brulee how I love you so.... the birfday girl got a Mexican Vanilla Creme Brulee and it was perfect... the custard was sweet but not too sweet and the brulee was a wonderful golden brown thin layer of crispy sugar goodness. Extensive wine list, classic and infusion mixed drinks. I suggest making reservations.. this place is consistently packed.The Fork That Roared.For some reason, maybe due to the name, I thought this restaurant would be just a step above a Chili's or a TGIF--that is to say, a chain restaurant. I should have known better, however, since Lynn W. selected RF for her birthday dinner--and she has excellent taste.The basket of assorted breads was a fantastic way to start the meal. And the seared scallop appetizer was worthy of a good old-fashioned plate licking--but I abstained. When my pork tenderloin arrived my stomach jumped in anticipation. The tenderloin stretched the breadth of my plate, anchored by a dollop of cheesy grits, and topped with grilled corn and a wonderful sweetly tart sauce. The pork was very tender and cooked until it was rosy in the middle, as I had requested. I never order pork in restaurants because I'm always afraid it will be dry. But after eating each delicious bite of this tenderloin, I will certainly start ordering more pork.I skipped dessert because I was so full. Instead I sat and marveled at how good the food is at Roaring Fork and took in my surroundings. The ambiance confused me a little, I'll admit, as I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant or something more casual. Regardless, everything I ate was delicious, and everyone in our party agreed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will happily eat here again.Plus there's the bonus of being able to play with the branding iron in front of the rotisserie in the entryway when it's late and nobody's watching. ;)Rawr.If you're a meat and potatoes sort of person like I am, The Roaring Fork will do you just fine. While I'm sure this is the trendiest of eateries in town (I was the youngest person at happy hour by about 10 years!), the Old West spirit of simple, wood-fired grub is both timeless and ageless. Named after a river in Colorado, thing big and gutsy, and that translates to fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs (smothered in a Dr. Pepper bbq sauce, no less), green chile mac 'n cheese, and smashed potatoes. The food here is meant to satiate and stuff, in all the right ways. My only regret was not trying their infamous "Big Ass Burger" but that just leaves room for another visit one day.P.S. If you can handle it, figure out a way to try their Pineapple Cornmeal Upside Down Cake; I'm not sure if it really embodies the Southwest or anything, but it sure tastes good!I love the cozy feel of Roaring Fork, but what's even better than the atmosphere is their incredible happy hour menu. I think they have one of the best happy hours in town, especially when they start their all-night happy hour during the summer months! That's right, I said all night happy hour! Their happy hour menu includes their signatures items including the pork stew, fish tacos and the Big Ass burger...and yes friends, it's truly a Big Ass Burger! Keep an eye on their updates because a little birdie told me that the all night happy hour is coming to town very soon!I just need to start out by saying... BEST HAPPY HOUR ever! Especially in the winter, it is just so cozy! The Big A$$ burger is $10 and absolutely incredible. I DO encourage you to share it because it is MASSIVE (hence the name). I am also a huge fan of their guacamole ($7) and wedge salad ($6). Cocktails and wine are $5 and I highly recommend getting the huckleberry frozen margarita. Two of them will send you off smiling from ear to ear. :) Roaring Fork is one of the best places in town when you're comparing quality, quantity & price! Enjoy!

Review Text :
Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love Vegas.Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love staying at the Cal Hotel when they go to Vegas.Hawaiians, for whatever reason, will spend their last waking moments in Vegas... literally an hour before they take the early evening flight on Hawaiian Airlines back to the islands... eating local Hawaiian food at Aloha Specialties at the Cal Hotel!At least this was what was going on when I was here the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We waited in that long-ass line close to HALF AN HOUR. I struck up a conversation with the woman behind me about how the tap water in Vegas tastes terrible. (For those of you who aren't aware, the tap water in Hawaii is magically delicious.)Alright, now for the actual review. This place is like a Zippy's with a much longer wait but a much smaller menu. However, for a mainland Hawaiian restaurant, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. My dad and I both ordered the fried saimin (which to my dismay was mediocre... should have gone for the $4.95 large regular saimin!). My mom got some special Japanese lunch box (which I forget the name of), and my sister ordered the Korean-style beef and chicken plate lunch combo, which was really good. The mac salad hit the spot too.There are a number of Hawaiian places around Vegas, but my guess is that this is the place to go if you wanna feel that real spirit of Aloha. Maybe that's just because it's full of Hawaiians in an extra good mood because they're grindin on yummy authentic local food. Just be prepared to WAIT.Took a spam musubi ($1.50) to go, and ate it while I waited for my flight back to SF. I bet I got a bunch of weird looks by those unaware of the power of something resembling a oversized, angular sushi roll... but I don't care!My coworkers always tell me the best place to get Hawaiian Food in Vegas is at the California Hotel (http://www.thecal.com/) at a restaurant called Aloha Specialties. (http://www.thecal.com/display.cfm?id=1075) About 80% of the Hawaiians that come to Vegas make a pilgrimage to this hotel. Interesting... Anyways, Aloha Specialties is decent size that can seat about 100 people or so. Surprisingly they need it cuz the line is always out the door. We waited about 15 minutes to put our order in and then another 10 minutes for them to bring it out to our table. The food is amazing and the dishes are about $7 each. They have a huge selection and since we couldnt order the whole menu, we decided on: The Beef Stew, Korean Beef and Korean Chicken, and the Special Mix Plate. I would definitely come eat here again.I like the fact that if I'm buzzed playin' blackjack, or buzzed getting mugged by the one armed bandit Wheel of Fortune slot machine (which I now call the Wheel of Doom), and a Spam Musubi craving hits, I can pop upstairs, get it handled, and then get back to the debauchery.  Also, a nice hot steamy bowl of Saimin goes a long way after those nights out drinking until 6am...Woohoo! As good as it gets! (but only in vegas)If this restaurant were in a town called Honolulu, It would warrant  3.5 stars but while living in Las Vegas for 5 years, Aloha Specialties is 5 stars, Woohoo! As good as it gets! A taste of home away from home.You may not win at the slots downstairs at the Cal but an escalator ride up to the second floor,  you'll be a Winner with Dinner! (lunch and breakfast too)Do as I do, order the Hamburger steak with mac salad, rice.  A side order of Mahi w/ extra tartar sauce. A small saimin, spam musubi to go and a passion orange juice.On a typical day, I'm a polite girl, BUT, Big BUT, when it comes to local food, and I'm in a starvation mode, Or if I'm losing big on the tables, I'll push, shove, gauge your eyes out, to get my hands on my favorite local grub. I'll even snake your table, call in my food order on the phone instead of waiting in that long line.  I'll get my food quicker than you, one way or another.   SUCKA!Where's the Aloha, Love? Sorry, left it at home.I'm a particularly strange gal.For me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a meal stop at the California Hotel.  Specifically, no trip to Vegas is complete without my Hawaiian food fix.This trip was no different.  Sure, I could have had the Loco Moco downstairs at Market Street, but... I was in the mood for full-on Hawaiian.Large saimin with veggies and wontons?  Check.Loco Moco plate?  Check.Spam musubis?  Check.Ahhh.  Talk about an awesome lunch.I don't understand why people would shell out tons of dough on whatevers food at the Strip when Aloha Specialties is just a five minute drive away.Save yourself a bundle and check out this joint.  It's ghetto, but definitely hits the spot.Then you can go to Lappert's for ice cream afterwards!Yippee!!My family from Hawaii always stay at the California Hotel when they come out to Vegas 2 or 3 times a year.  Although they are here frequently, it has been a couple of years since we've eaten at this restaurant.  I was in the mood for some Saimin so we headed down to meet them here for lunch.I ordered a small bowl of Saimin ($5.99) and a Teri-Burger ($6.99).  Their definition of "small" is Hawaiian Small.....which means H-U-G-E!  The bowl of Saimin was about a 1/2 gallon.  It was tasty as usual.  The Teri-Burger was very good too.....it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad....but I didn't try it, I was too stuffed.A couple of tips if you are going to visit this place:- It gets very crowded during Lunch and Dinner hours, so it's best to go between those meal periods.- It's a self service restaurant where you order at the counter and they either call your number or take it to your table.- You can order take out.- There is fresh iced water in jugs on the right side of the restaurant.....I didn't see this and ordered bottled Water.Overall, it was another good meal at Aloha Specialties....I got my Saimin fix for a while.Will I return?  You bet I will.it's alright. decent price, no wait. and service is fast. i only had a spam musubi for $2. it helped ease my growling stomach. I had a few bites of the kalua pork -- it was okay.. i wish the cabbage and the pork were more shredded. And it was too watery. I like it a bit more dry. The rice that came with was not hot and was not soft either. It tasted like day old rice. -- no bueno.on another note this place definitely satisfies your hungry stomach.After a 10 hour drive from SF to Vegas, we were anxious to fill our growling tummies. After hearing about the best Hawaiian food at the California Hotel and seeing the pictures of delicious poke on Yelp, we were sold. We didn't have to return our rental car for a few hours, so we quickly drove 20 minutes off the strip to Aloha Specialties Restaurant. What a disappointment! First of all, we were told that they haven't served poke in about a year. Talk about false advertisement! If you're looking to order poke, look elsewhere. They don't have it here. Fine, everything else on the menu looked appetizing enough that we could probably still be satisfied sans poke right? Wrong! When we got our meals, no one left satisfied. I wouldn't suggest wasting gas, cab money or calories here at all.3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars!  Aloha Specialties Restaurant is the popular one-stop shop for local Hawaiian food when you visit Las Vegas.  The restaurant is located in the California Hotel and Casino.  You need to time your visit here (i.e., go early) because this place gets crowded!  I always wondered why Hawaii people would rush to a Hawaii restaurant in Las Vegas.  Don't we get enough local food at home?  It's all about comfort food.Prices are reasonable, but the food preparation can take a while.  Be sure you have some good topics to talk with your table mates about.  Employees here work super hard to ensure you have a good experience.Large Saimin Noodles:  This dish was just like eating local noodles at home in Hawaii.  The portions are quite large.  The saimin tasted like S&S saimin.  Although the noodles were a bit too soft and smooshy for me, it reminded me of my childhood.  Nice.  Grade:  Bhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#q_r79ge6x7EL_xu82rWY5QChicken Curry & Rice:  This dish wasn't my favorite.  Period.  The flavor was right on, but the texture was a bit starchy and thick.  Not my style of local chicken curry.  Grade:  C+Pork Tofu:  This dish was like home cooking!  Slices of pork cooked with onions, tofu, and served in a mirin, shoyu, and hondashi sauce!  WINNER!  Grade:  A!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#_vF_tioidPEEiY4eFWmoCASpicy Korean BBQ Chicken:  The highlight of my dish was the grilled Korean BBQ chicken.  Three thighs were served with a whole lot of rice and a side of macaroni salad.  Well prepared, well cooked, delicious flavor.  Grade:  A-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?select=0L7OXNm25KcXc31ftjIpUw#0L7OXNm25KcXc31ftjIpUwFood Grade:  BService Grade:  BWorth The Money Grade:  BOverall Impression Grade:  BLocated on the 2nd floor of the California Hotel. If it weren't for the long wait times to get your food and CASH ONLY, this place would be 5 stars in my book. The food portions are huge and decently priced. You know this place is authentic when you see an abundance of Hawaiian customers. I love the food here, but I still haven't forgiven them for making me miss my flight. The day after some qt and barhopping with the bff, he was craving Hawaiian and thought we had time to grab some lunch here before taking me to McCarran. It would've been true if we went somewhere else!!We ordered our food to-go and waited about 50 mins until we got it. The wait is ridiculous! Of course I missed my opportunity to check in on time and I had to scramble to find another flight. I had the most expensive spam musubis ever that day hahah ($180 for last minute flight to LAX).Need some Island style home cooking? Well Aloha Specialties is the place to visit for that itch. Located on the second floor of the California Hotel & Casino. I felt I was transported back to Waikiki. I arrived on a Sunday and made it a point to drive directly here after landing from  So Cal. I had a Hawaiian grub itch that needed fixing quick. After valet parking (self park $3.00) I jumped in the long line to place my order and  opted for the small saimin and Loco Moco since I couldn't decide  on what to choose. Not long after being seated the friendly waitress brought me the two entrees.  I cracked up BC she was looking for another person to give a dish to. Even the customer next to me was shocked what I was going to attempt to do. We laughed about taking leftovers for dinner. Hey at these bargain prices - how could I possibly go wrong? It's cash only so leave your plastic in your purse or wallets people.The saimin broth was yummy, chau Sui seasoned to perfect flavor - not overcooked or to sweet and just the right amount of fat. the small order was generously sized and hit the spot. The loco moco was also gigantic with a steamed rice base topped with a hamburger patty and drenched with gravy and a medium cooked egg once top . Talk about comfort food - this definitely is the place to find it. There's seating out front if you''re nto people watching while dinning and many entrees sell out as did that day. I'm looking forward to returning and sampling  additional island style favorites.This review is long overdue as I've been here more times than I can count, over the years. The California Hotel & Casino is like the capital of the 9th Hawaiian island, known as Las Vegas. If you're from Hawaii, you know this to be the truth! Take a stroll thru the casino - the odds of hitting the lottery are better than never seeing someone from Hawaii. Anyway - some locals like to go the California to eat at Aloha Specialties. Somewhat reasonable prices for decent portions. This last visit, I had a bowl of Saimin with won ton and a side of macaroni salad. The Saimin broth is ok but the noodles are a little thick and a little chewy. Won tons - too much dough. I prefer to have more meat filling. A little on the chewy side too. To clarify - not a crunchy chew but bordering under cooked pasta. Al dente.Macaroni salad - made with too much mayo. I love mayo but if you take a look at my pics, it was like instead of using one entire container of Costco size mayo, two were used. Walking in - get in line to place your order then find seating. No table service. Your order is brought out and if you want water or refills, there's a water station. I can't speak as to refills as I opted for water. I know I have posted other reviews that are critical of "Hawaiian" restaurants. This one is no exception. Having been born and raised in Hawaii - I'm not a fan of this place and I only went because family was craving one of the dishes served there.

Review Text :
Move over Branson, Missouri! The Barleen family has built quite the variety show mecca in Apache Junction. The Arizona Opry is a hoot! It's like a 1980s Disney variety show (no characters) crossed with Hee Haw! One of the performers looks like John Denver and sings a few covers. (There's a John Denver Tribute Show planned for February) Another dresses up like Willie Nelson. The husband is an original member of the Tokens (The Lion Sleeps Tonight) and, of course, reprises the song as a part of the show. They play about 70 different instruments throughout the night. The show takes place in a big hall off Old West Highway, filled with snowbirds and Red Hat Ladies. There's a gift shop with novelties like blinking rings and yodeling pickles and a "record store" with CDs from all of the performers. They've created quite the library over the years!! For the low, low price of $29 including tax and tip ($22 for kids age 3-12), you get all of this PLUS a cafeteria-inspired meal of roast beef or chicken (depending on the night) and chocolate cake. Lemonade and coffee are included and beer is available for $4.50/bottle. It's family fun, although, somewhat cheesy -- you've gotta give it to them - they've got talent. So, grab the kids or the old folks, and head out to the Opry. It's a kick!If you see a family of traveling mountain style performers as a child, and then at the ripe old age of 29 are instantly reminded of them when you walk into a meateriffic heart attack inducing "Feedbag" style restaurant...doesn't that say something about them as performers?  I think it does.  If you're nearby, brink yer youngins.  They're gonna love it.I had a tape that I bought of the Barleen Family for years.  I have no idea what happened to it.  SO tempted to call them up and order a CD.  Seriously.

I picked up Picnic Company today to-go.  I have been a handful of times to this location, and I'm always pleased.  The staff is friendly and the food is quality! Prices are reasonable also... you can order a full lunch for under $10!Order the almond chicken salad or make your own sandwich up (like Jared does)... you can't go wrong!  The honey mustard dressing is really good and so are the homemade croutons that come in most of the salads.  Their side items are always fresh and yummy - I like that they offer fresh fruit.  Their raspberry iced tea is refreshing too.  Big serving sizes are another picnic company plus.  I have never ordered their food to go and taken it on a picnic (as the name suggests) but now that we live so close to this location, I'm hoping we'll do that sometime soon!  Until then, I have no problem dining in or taking out from this casual eatery in my new hood!I'm not sure what's going on with you, Picnic Company, but I popped in to visit you today for lunch with Colleen and Amanda... I wanted to show you off to my out-of-town friends.  But unfortunately, you let me down!You had no fruit salad and you were out of ham.  Not only that, but I noticed your menu said no yogurt either... and the topper?  No bottled water - ok, I can deal with that.  But if you're out of bottled water and I request a large cup for water, do not charge me 50 cents for the cup.  Really?I hope I just hit you up on a bad day... I miss the Picnic Company I know and love!

I was sold at "fat free tuna fish." There aren't many sandwich shops that make tuna fish sandwiches with fat free mayo and yet it's so simple to do so! Luckily, Arizona Bread Company has this mastered and knows how to make a tasty tuna fish sandwich on their soft and delicious bread. Arizona Bread Company is simple in looks but their bread speaks wonders. It's freshly made, very soft and flavorful. I especially like that they have a variety of different breads to choose from. I even noticed a chili bread! The sandwiches here are good and it probably has something to do with the bread, which makes all the different in the world. The staff is friendly and fast and they have plenty of seating options inside the deli. This is a great lunch spot and one where you'll get in and out in no time...and with a good sandwich in your belly!

Tragically hip. Tragically mediocore service (they serve good coffee, the staff should really drink more...let's pick up the pace here people!). Tragically, not in my comfort  zone anymore. What's not so tragic is the freakin' white flannel hash. The bomb. Perfect everytime. I purposely leave some in the corners of my mouth so I can continue to snack on it as I walk to my car.I went there for breakfast and despite sitting on a park bench 100 feet away waiting for my friends I couldn't find the damn place. My fault, not the establishment's. I was greeted by someone at the door who immediately made the accusation, "Can I HELP you?" So I walked out and waited for my friends outside. The air conditioning wasn't working inside so it was a wash. They arrived and we were immediately seated. I was told to order the coffee soda, which I obeyed due to my brilliance. Brilliance because that shit is gooooooood. I didn't like it as much when I put the cream in it though. I appreciated that the server admitted to being hung over immediately upon her first visit to our table sort of warning us not to expect too much but she ended up being fine. But the same guy that accused me of needing help when I walked in also asked for our drink order in a very accusatory style. Something like you'd get at Fate. After I had been eyeing it, my veteran Orange Table companion recommended I try the jalapeno pecan pancakes and I cemented my status as the world's premier recommendation-taker because after eating about half the plate and being too full to finish, I thought about that strange, beautiful combination of flavors the rest of the day. It's a little spicy so if you hate spice don't order it. Otherwise, it's fantastic. My friend told me not to yelp this place after only one visit. She said it's such a cornucopia of experiences that this place bound to serve up in the future that I should yelp on the average rather than this one experience. But it was a good one, and I'll be back. Having owned an unsuccessful small business and having a roommate who owns a medium sized business, I can appreciate everything that it takes to make something work. Normally I'd complain about the air not working or the fucking weird dude working there who speaks in accusations but I could tell in the taste of food that this is someone's baby, which needs to be nurtured by the community and not nitpicked.I decided to try The Orange Table after finding out about the Scottsdale cafe in The Phoenix New Times "Best Of" issue. It was featured as the best neighborhood coffee shop in Scottsdale, and I decided to investigate that claim. My boyfriend and I went there for a late breakfast one Saturday morning. After a grueling search for the restaurant in Old Scottsdale, we finally found it deep into the bowels of Scottsdale Mall. Was our victorious search rewarded with a pleasant and friendly greeting from the restaurant's host? No. Were we at least greeted promptly and with an ounce of civility? Nope and nope. We stood at the entrance being ignored until we dared to ask one of the servers standing behind the register if we were to seat ourselves to which he replied something along the lines of "No, I'll seat you when I'm done awkwardly ignoring you." To all hip Phoenix-area restaurants: please stop this stupid no-host bullshit. Have someone ready to receive customers so they don't have to flag down someone to learn the rules. Eventually, Put Upon sat us and, thankfully, was not our server.  That honor went to one of the other pissed-off, unfriendly hipsters manning the joint. Thankfully, the food, for the most part, was much better than the service. I settled on some jungle pancakes, while my boyfriend went for some sort of Greek omelet. The Orange Table features an ambitious menu of inventive breakfast items and generously sized sandwiches that made for some tough choices. Although the prices are somewhat high, the entrees came in sumptuous portions. The only complaint I had about the meal itself was that, in this coffee shop, the brewed coffee we were served was lukewarm. Overall, The Orange Table has many things going for it, including an extensive, carefully crafted menu. However, from my experience there and the collective experiences of fellow Yelpers who dared to get there at the "wrong time," the service leaves much to be desired. I don't entirely blame the hipster help, as it appears that they aren't given the support they need. Someone needs to put the same care into the serving process as they did into the restaurant's ambiance and repertoire. Until then, I'll stick with restaurants that want and can handle my business.i didn't have the same lame service as everyone else. my drinks were refilled frequently, we got an awesome spot on the patio and the weather couldn't have been better. and the food, oh man!! the strawberry pancakes were amazing! we also ordered the monkey pancakes (banana, coconut, and almonds) and they were only so-so, I wouldn't order them again.Their bacon was perfectly crispy. the only bummer is they were out of coffee soda which I have been wanting to try. Oh well, next time.This place was super hard to find, it's in the actual scottsdale mall where they have all of the culture fests. we parked in the parking structure by los olivos.Today I wanted to take a dear friend to some place out of the ordinary , of the beaten path,  non-chainish  for Brunch . I had wanted to try this place for awhile but it never seemed to work out for us .  So today with no time  or kid constraints we set out .. we began our  search for thew perfect breakfast, and then we searched some more and then we backtracked and searched some more..Dang Y'all this place is hard to find. With a point in the direction from a nice landscaping type we searched some more .. aha the address.. ohh darn  it s the address for the whole building! Being the great  Easter egg hunter I am , I didn't give up, we looked high we looked low .. we found a sign , it's here ! It's where? Finally  there it was the ever elusive .. Orange Table .. not as  charming on the outside as I hoped , we still went in and decided to give it a try.  The servers were uber helpful and gracious .. they are really working on service , we had quick drinks, great explanations on food ,  we also heard from our waitress that they create all food fresh and nothing is sitting thus the longer time to wait.. hmm okay ..  she also  had apologies for waiting for a drink .. didn't notice..The apricot tea was fabulous and really hit the spot after our trek to find this little nirvana. The food on the menu all sounded great and looked amazing at the other tables .We ordered two omelets to share with sourdough toast. My gruyere and mushroom omelet had a tasty sauce that made me want to lick the plate.  My friend's Monaco omelet was tres Mediterranean  and tasted yummers too!  We both were happy with our meals and want to come back. Loved the place it would get five  stars if I could of found it easier, portions were bigger, and the breads were more interesting .. But I will be back .Another poem (although not by popular demand...it's just the voices in my head demanding attention:)I stopped for some lunch at the old Orange Table,They always have savory food,It was crowded as hell (even in summer),So the service was not very good;The wait staff is hip and they sort of act cool,By their looks, I could tell I was not,I was wearing a golf shirt and old cargo shorts,They just didn't think I was hot;They chatted with friends, and hung out in the kitchen,But they did bring my soup, hot and tasty,And a good turkey sandwich with lettuce and mayo,The bread was just right, thick and crustySo would I return to the tables of Orange?Oh sure, they are right in my 'hood,The food is just fine, all fresh and well made,But I'd have to be in a great mood:)I just had some of the best pancakes ever at Orange Table!  The jalapeno pecan pancakes are perfection!  Unfortunately, the service is far from perfection.In skimming the reviews, there seems to be a common theme with service issues; however, it seems like there are an awful lot of excuses made for the poor service.  Call me crazy, but perhaps if the staff is too hungover to work or too hip to manage a smile, the service industry is not their calling...unless they work here I guess.When we walked in, there were a couple empty tables, but no one was interested in even acknowledging us.  I finally interrupted the server at the counter to ask if we were to seat ourselves.  Without looking up all we got was "no, there's a wait."  At least another 5 minutes went by before she could be bothered to get our name.  Those who came in after us were met by other servers with the same attitude.  The server who took eventually took our name ended up waiting on us as well.  She became slightly more pleasant, but the wait for everything was ridiculous.   At the point our food arrived, we still had no utensils.  My husband had planned to get coffee before we left, but we got the check abruptly.  The only thing without a wait.So for those of you who want to hang out a couple hours for breakfast, the Orange Table may be your dream restaurant.  I would just suggest bringing your own drinks...and maybe a fork, so as to not unduly burden the servers.  I, on the other hand, will be making my own jalapeno pecan pancakes.  Thanks for the idea Orange Table!I'm pissed.  Surprised...and pissed.  What the hell happened to Orange Table!?  My boyfriend and I stopped for breakfast on Sunday and experienced the worst service I think that I have had anywhere!We ordered breakfast.  After waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), I went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  The response was, and I quote, "The kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes."  Note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.After waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  When we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and I quote: "Haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  We are always slow on the weekend."  Are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  This is an appropriate response!?  Again, no apology.  No offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  And is slow service EVER an acceptable policy!?A few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and I stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  We even said to the waiter, "We were just going to leave."  No response.  None!  Couldn't friggin' believe it.I used to tell everyone about this place.  No more.This is one of the many trendy little hot spots in the Old Town Scottsdale area. We came here for a late breakfast one fine Saturday afternoon. Luckily, maybe because it was late there wasn't a wait at all. We were able to get a nice little seat outside on the patio so we could enjoy the weather and do some good people watching. I will admit that some other reviewers are right... the service here isn't amazing. Our server seemed very rushed and distracted, but at no point in time during our meal was she bad enough to really make us take notice. At some point in time... you realize that these waitresses are more trendy than professional, so if you can enjoy your breakfast knowing that you aren't going to get the best service of your life, you'll have fun. The best way I could describe it, would be like you are getting waited on by a less mature younger sibling. They may not be doing the best job... but they mean well. If you're the type of person that demands impeccable service, this could very well be a deal breaker. The food here is fresh and flavorful... the dishes match the independent vibe of the building and staff very well. The standouts for us were the "Monkey Cakes" which were very nicely cooked pancakes with bananas and slivered almonds in the batter, very yummy! By all means, I recommend this place to 9/10 people. If you're comfortable in this yuppie type of environment you'll more than likely enjoy it. We'll probably be back some time to try more, or maybe even give their lunch/dinner menu a go.Strong coffee. Stronger Bloody Marys. A perfect hideaway to catch up with friends and while away a few hours, especially considering the extremely casual approaching to waiting tables that goes on here! Best reason to go though: Proof that hipsters, skinny jeans and Zooey Deschanel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVh8kVZ_XM) look-alikes do exist in Arizona!Well... usually I excuse poor service to a certain degree... but our last trip to the Orange Table was remarkably bad as far as service is concerned. We waited nearly 20 minutes before someone came over to our table... and as many of you know this is not a big place! Then when our waiter did come he just kind of stood there and said "wassup". For a second I thought I was going to have to spell it out for him; "Well, we just came here to eat some food, which is what we're attempting to do right now". Thank God the food is still great... so for now we're only gonna downgrade Orange Table by one star down to a three out of five. Our burger and sandwich were damn good... as was our cream soda; but the highlight of this visit without a doubt the fact that our waiter is a glorified Youtube/Reality TV star (well, not in a good way... and I guess I'm exaggerating quite a bit when I say 'star'). Anyone remember that episode of Cheaters where the goofy dude with the mullet had this uber-attractive girlfriend only to cheat on her (Not very helpful... I guess this describes a lot of episodes of Cheaters)? Anyway, the dude gets interviewed and spouts off this gem:"I do chicks man... that's just what I do". ...he then spouts off all sorts of other nonsense, trying to show that he is the man of all men, which he clearly isn't. The clip was featured on The Soup and a bunch of other shows and was cringe inducing because you wonder how a mullet sporting piece of white trash could nab the type of girl he was with... and not only that... but find more women to cheat on her with, it's only shit you could see on crappy reality TV. Anyway... that dude now waits tables at the Orange Table and was our waiter the other day. So now you know at least one reason why the service isn't exactly grade A.Breakfast or lunch, this is a place I can visit knowing I won't leave hungry. When I make a stop into Orange Table, I prepare myself for a bit of a wait, but the experience is eclectic and fun so I really don't mind. This is a restaurant where I can go and lounge and enjoy a lazy Saturday or Sunday when those types of days come around. Situated in the middle of the Civic Center, there are many times when the weather is nice and a festival is going on outside, so Orange Table makes for a perfect cuisine break before browsing the different tables at the festival. I stumbled upon Orange Table years ago and discovered that the food is pretty darn tasty when I'm hungry and needing some...umm.. thick food to help with dehydration from the night before. It's hard to decide between their breakfast and lunch but it all depends on the mood and everything on the menu is excellent. For lunch, I go for their chicken sandwich and for breakfast I normally go for the eggs, bacon and potatoes but their pancakes are excellent as well. When the weather's nice I love the outdoor patio and the indoor dining area is nice to spend some time in and relax. Be prepared for a wait if you get there too late because it's not a huge restaurant and popularity fills it up fast!After hearing Orange Table had gotten their service issues corrected, I had to judge for myself.It's TRUE!!!!!!!!  Things were a little slow in the beginning, so I was worried.  But once our server did make it to us, things were pretty good.  Food did not take nearly as long as it used to, and wait for this.......................................................................................our server was PLEASANT!  I know, like night and day.Welcome back to my life OT!7/03/13I've dined here by myself and with an aunt prior to today's meal, and I'm surprised I haven't updated my '09 review, yet.  (When I stumble onto those photos, some are dated 2012, I will have to add them with accompanying reviews- hopefully soon'ish.)Brought Mom and visiting sis and her two kids with me for breakfast and seated ourselves in Harper's section.  (We assumed he was new, since it took awhile for him to greet us hello with our menus and glasses of water that kept slipping from his grasp and landing with thuds and splashes of water on the table.  We had to ask him on his return visit to take our orders to wipe up the spills-- maybe, because of his nervousness, he forgot to wipe up the spills automatically?)  I ordered a Mocha http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=TV17TplQu-8JWzwEoCIL-Q#TV17TplQu-8JWzwEoCIL-Q and was asked for the first time (I've been here a few times in the past few months) if I preferred whole, 2%, or non-fat milk.  I assumed I was served whole milk in the past, so I decided to try one with 2%.  Sister ordered the Mexican chocolate coffee, and everyone else had water or soda.  Here is what we all ordered:Red flannel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=9aaOzFYNBxJTH_-x7ZvEtw#9aaOzFYNBxJTH_-x7ZvEtwBananas Foster French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=ILKRAvof4ebudeC9CrTojg#ILKRAvof4ebudeC9CrTojgCorned beef hash http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=HGN4WwDMfDUy-87_NZ8j5A#HGN4WwDMfDUy-87_NZ8j5AWhite flannel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=5XaxXOQptdGzuMGI2_iF1Q#5XaxXOQptdGzuMGI2_iF1QBasic buttermilk cakes (two cakes in an order, with added chocolate chips on one of them) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=qmtVNuiojC5Mo3DgV1cs7A#qmtVNuiojC5Mo3DgV1cs7AAs I ordered the French toast and the Red flannel, Mom mentioned that she and I were going to share the French toast, and my sister placed their orders of corned beef hash (niece), buttermilk cakes (nephew, with one of the cakes with chocolate chips- extra charge, of course), and the white flannel for her.  I asked if I could change my wheat bread selection to olive, and Harper said yes, but the olive toast ended up on sister's plate.  We had to remind him of my side of bacon and sausage.  The French toast didn't have enough bananas, and I wished I remembered to ask for some bananas placed on top of the toast, as well as whatever slices come in the whiskey sauce itself, which came with subbed almonds.  The lack of bananas was a little disappointing, so I suggest to request extra bananas-- the name of the dish is Bananas Fosters, yes?  The Red flannel would've been very good, but it felt undercooked.  Definitely mushy in texture, and not as texturally-satisfying as the order of Green flannel my aunt had back in November '12-- I tried a little portion of it and liked the crisped edges!  Also, all of the flannels we ordered today looked slightly disappointing-- maybe there's a new cook?  No one ate the flannel leftovers we brought home; However, sister liked her White flannel entree...  The flannels did taste better when eaten with sour cream.The chocolate chip pancake was delicious!  Nephew isn't a big eater, so I was able to try some (thank goodness OT serves 100% pure maple syrup!), as well as some of the leftovers at home.  I'd say the highlights of breakfast that morning were the sides of Nueske's bacon and one sausage and the olive toast!  My mocha made with 2% milk wasn't popular with anyone, including me, so I'd suggest ordering it with whole milk (leftover Mocha keeps well in the fridge for at least a week!).  Sister  had to add sugar to her Mexican chocolate coffee to enjoy it.  (She tried it without sugar, the way I drink my coffee, and "it was tolerable," but definitely better with Splenda.)  Everyone enjoyed the atmosphere (and the couches!), and with a few tweaks, this could've been a four-star.  Good luck to Harper!

Restaurant name  Makino LV
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Makino is fine for what it is.  I sometimes stop by here and get a take out box and just stuff the box with stuff.  It usually comes to like $10 or so which is fine.  But I don't like the idea of the sushi just SITTING there the whole time getting dry or whatever.  The sushi buffet places that make it to order are definitely a better way to go.  Don't get me wrong though..I'll still eat these rolls if they're there.  I just think there are better choices out there for sushi buffets like Sushi Hana or even Sushi Factory.BTW...Penn from Rio's "Penn and Teller" dines here for lunch quite often.  I've seen him there at least 4 times and I don't here that often for my takeout box.  You can't miss him.I'm probably biased with Makinos since that is like my favorite AYCE sushi joint there, but man I love this place...Anytime and every time I'm in Vegas, you know you can count on me visiting one of the Makino locations for sure!For those of you who read my other Makino review (located in the heart of the LV Fashion Outlets), know that the variety of sushi at this place is just terrific!  If you were to compare Makinos to the likes of Todai, Onami, etc... I'm telling you Makino will blow it out of the water!  So this Makino branch on Decatur'Flamingo is suppose to be the original Makinos that has set foot in Vegas.  For those who don't know, Mr. Makino was (I believe) the founder of Todai... then later when the quality was not up to par or as he has intended he decided to sell the chain and create Makino in Vegas instead to keep his sushi legacy going.So let's get back on track to the sushi part of the story...  What don't you want? What can't you get?  It's got everything here!  6 different types of California rolls, 10 types of fusion rolls, 10 types of nigiri, and a few other deep fried sushi for those of you who loves anything fried... the best part about Makinos?  The menu is not set and it changes daily... so let the imagination creation run wide my sushi chefs!  (numbers are approximations but it is quite vast for sure!)I can't tell you which rolls are good but I'm a sucker for fusion sushi..  (I'm not all that into the good old traditional styles so you can definitely call me biased on that!)  So majority of them are all very tasty!  (I just skip those that has cream cheese in them because sushi don't taste right with cream cheese in my mind)  So try them all and let me know which is your favorite!  Then for those who are not keen on sushi there's a lot more you can work with!  They've got cold salad selections (about 5 kinds), assorted hot foods for you to choose from ranging from teriyaki chicken, sukiyaki beef, deep fried tofu, steam fish, miso soup, beef ribs, gyoza, fried rice, yakisoba, steam veggies, udon noodle soup, clams, mussels, tempura veggies, and my favorite of them all, the tempura shrimp!  (These shrimps are so amazing! and it would be worth it already if you just sit there and down about 50 of them!!!  LOL!)Lastly, let's not forget about the desserts!  A decent selection of baked goods are available but the one of the tastier selection is the almond jello!  So rich in almond flavor.. yum!  And of course we can't forget about the ice cream parlor!!!  Red Bean ice cream is the way to go here!  Just simply delicious if you have never tried red bean ice cream!  (They also have vanilla, chocolate, green tea, and occasionally, a couple other flavors such as strawberry or cookies n' cream)So for those of you who are sushi specialists and not really caring much about how much it would cost to have 3 tiny plates of sushi presented in front of you, this is definitely not the place for you!  However, if you are down for a good, tasty, and fresh AYCE sushi that won't break your bank, Makino's is highly recommend.  It does take a little drive out of the strip but compared to the usual buffets in Vegas, this is definitely well worth the quick sight-seeing trip!Ok, there are probably much better sushi buffets or AYCE joints around town but for the price you really can't beat Makino. Now that the Premium Outlets location closed, I decided to come to this one. It's been a while since I last visited this location and was probably way back when they first opened it. We walked in at around 12:30 PM and were immeidately seated. We noticed that the restaurant was super cramped and crowded compared to the old outlet location, mainly because the space is smaller and it looked like they crammed as many tables as they could into the small space. Our table was about 2 inches away from the table next to us and located right by the dessert area of the buffet, which meant there were constantly people squeezing by. Space aside, our meal was excellent and we left in a dazzed food coma.The buffet area includes a salad bar, sushi area with various sushi rolls, nigiri and hand rolls, a hot food area serving various appetizers (gyoza, wings, etc) and Japanese food including udon and ramen stations. Lastly there is a dessert area with various sweets, ice cream and a chocolate fountain. We were way too full at the end of our meal to really have dessert, but I can never pass up green tea ice cream and the one here is no exception. I ended up stuffing a scoop down before leaving.Overall for $17.95 + drinks ($16.95 on weekdays for lunch), you can't beat it anywhere in the valley. Just know that if you come earlier, it could be way more crowded and a line can form. By about 1 PM the crowds died down and we didn't feel as cramped moving around the buffet.Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #288 - #365We were staying at Encore and they decided to eat at Makino  AYCE dinner because it was cheaper than eating on the strip, especially at Encore. Located about 10 minutes from the strip in a mediocre area of Vegas. I don't know the price per head because I didn't pay, Woot! This isn't just any kind of buffet but a Japanese Buffet. It was just average and the sashimi didn't taste fresh at all and I'm glad I didn't try to beef because several people in our party got food poisoning! they did have a great selection of sushi rolls and most of them had a lil too much rice and less fish. I would come back to give it another try.

Well...we (5) stopped in around 9:30am and all the tables were taken but had only a short wait. We ordered a little of everything... from biscuits and gravy to waffles and pork chops and omelets. All were ok though portion size was considerably smaller than I remember from our last visit. Nothing really good nor bad and service was ok too hence the 3 stars. Actually I should give give my son Jeff an extra star for picking up the tab. Thanks son! :-)Whenever we're in Phoenix visiting family we stop at the Waffle House at least once. We enjoy the waffles, eggs, and bacon. A delicious way to start a day of shopping and hanging out.Laurel, our waitress, was both friendly and attentive. The waffles were just as expected . . . warm, tasty, flavorful and abundant. The hint of vanilla brings it home for me everytime. In fact, I use no topping so as not to dilute the robust waffle flavor. Scrambled eggs. Perfection. Two eggs scrambled on the grill. Not overdone. Fluffy, and delicate.Glass of orange juice. Heaven.

If there was an option to give NEGATIVE STARS I would. This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had. Here's what happened We show up to the restaurant with a party of 8. To our surprise we were sat immediately... Now we know why. We sat for about 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks. Another 20 minutes rolled by and we still didn't have service. I finally got up and approached a manager and asked if we had a waiter coming. He said "I'm sure you do" and turned around. Strike 1.Our waitress finally arrived. She said "what does everyone want to order" she took our orders and walked away. We didn't see her until she brought put food out 45 minutes later. Completely out of water she never attempted to refill. Strike 2We ordered the 11.99 steak & lobster special, chicken fingers & fries, bacon Mac & cheese, and the rib sampler. My fries were actually as cold as the ranch. The best thing that was ordered was the Mac & Cheese. The steak & lobster were so rubbery it was unbearable to eat. Now we weren't expecting much for this price but I didn't know steak could possibly have this type of consistency. Strike 3We were never asked how the food was, our waters & beers were never refilled &  even after seeing the majority of food still on all the plates our waitress never thought to ask if everything was ok. I'm not sure if they just thought we were tourists but we are actually locals and all in the service industry. And to top it off the gratuity was already added... Insanity. When we were leaving I expressed my disappointment to the manager & all he did was smile & say "have a nice night" And to top it off after expressing these feelings a few of the servers were laughing & highfived . I will have a nice night because I now have the knowledge to never return. PS I am a bartender downtown & will tell everyone I know to keep far as possible from this establishment.We came here with low expectations, after all we were here for the 4p-6:30p, $8.99 prime rib dinner special.  Located inside the Fremont Casino on Fremont Street of Las Vegas you can't not see the huge pictures boasting the $8.99 Prime Rib Special.  After 9pm you can get a $12.99 Steak and Lobster special, but that was way too late for our hungry tummies.There was a small line at Tony Roma's and the hostess passed out paper ticket numbers instead of the traditional write your name on list.  Much to our surprise the hostess rattled off numbers faster than a machine gun, often calling 6 parties at once.  For a split second I thought what is this, are we all going to sit at a cafeteria style bench?  I guess TR's gets about 1000 customers a night so they are really set up be fast and efficient.  We were seated quickly in a nice booth.  Again much to our surprise our waitress was fast and friendly as well.  Furthermore the helpers clearing tables, getting drink refills and bringing out food were all fast and friendly something I really didn't expect on a blue light special meal.Of course we ordered the prime rib which came with steamed veggies and a small baked potato.  The portions were good sized and tasty.  The night before we ate at Lawry's House of Prime Rib and although TR's prime rib is not comparable it was still moist, tender and flavorful. Although I wouldn't recommend Tony Roma's for any special occasions if you want a great deal on Prime Rib this is the spot to go.This Tony Roma's is located inside a Vegas casino and is nothing like any of the other Tony Roma's restaurants I have been to.All of the other Tony Roma's exude a certain level of classiness and have a few regular items on the menu that I always look forward to ordering.I feel that all Tony Roma's chains should live up to their usual standards, but this one falls far below. Where do I start?Firstly, the reason I decided to eat here in the first place was because of all the signs outside luring you in with a picture of juicy prime rib, accompanied by a big baked potato and veggies that says "Only $8.99!"After you walk through the rowdy smoke-filled casino to get to the restaurant, you are greeted by nobody. Rather, you have to walk up to an angry lady standing at a podium and let her know that you would like to be seated. She asks your name without looking at you, and writes it down as she rudely says "30 to 40 minute wait. No prime rib tonight."Are they kidding me? How is a place like this so packed? They don't offer the meal they so widely advertise and the service is already this crappy before even getting seated!I was very tempted to leave and eat elsewhere, but me and bae were hungry and didn't feel like going on the hunt for another restaurant.   We stood up until a seat cleared so we could sit down and wait. As we waited, we had to hear the lady at the podium scream names out as tables opened up. Why can't they invest in a microphone and speaker?Once we were seated, I decided to put the experience thus far behind me and order some of that yummy Tony Roma's food.I really look forward to the warm bread and savory garlic butter served at every Tony Roma's before your food comes. What a surprise, they do not carry the garlic butter. They don't even serve bread unless you request it. I did, but it never came.At least the entrée was good. We shared the Roma Rack of ribs, baked potato soup, and a fudge cookie ice cream dessert. During dinner, we had the privilege of witnessing a woman choke on her meat and a man perform the Heimlich Maneuver on her about 10 feet from our table. Thank God it worked and she was okay.My boyfriend drank a soda with his meal and I had a glass of water with lemon. It tasted like the most disgusting grade of tap water I ever drank. I hope they also invest in a Britta filter or something.Very classy joint, huh? This place almost has no right going under the name Tony Roma's unless they adjust their standards accordingly. I will never make the mistake of coming to this particular Tony Roma's ever again.This one is located inside the Fremont Hotel/Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. This place is always packed on the weekends expect to wait at least a min of 40 mins service is ok note the steak and lobster special is served at 9pm so if you come before that you won't be able to order it. If you're in the Downtown LV area this is one of the better places to eat other than the buffets or hotel restaurants.

This is your grandpa's Chinese restaurant.  Don't take that the wrong way.  It's just that the decor feels to me like it is out of the 60's or 70's.  Like maybe the restaurant could have been used as a set in the movie Dirty Dancing.  You know, when Baby and her Beau sneak off to town for some chow mien.The food varied, overall it was decent, not great.  The prices were reasonable and the service was kind of slow.We had crab puffs and an egg roll for starters.  They fall at about 2.00 stars.  The entrees we had:  lobster with black bean sauce, emperor's beef, Chinese fried chicken and pork fried rice.  The lobster meat was tender.  I didn't care for the sauce.   It looked and tasted like egg drop soup with some black beans stirred in.  1.5 stars.  The beef was in a mild brown sauce over assorted vegetables.  It was tasty but needed heat to set it off.  2.5 stars.  I did not like the Chinese fried chicken as it was overdone and tasted strongly of the frying oil.  2 stars.  You should know that my wife did like it despite pointing out that it was a little chewy.  The pork fried rice was very good, with BBQ pork in good quantity.  3.75 stars.  Take the 5 ratings listed above, total them up, divide by five and you have the true rating: 2.35 stars.  Just below average.

Review Text :
Luca's is a really odd space. It's a restaurant housed in an old church. In fact, this church (according to our server) was the very first church in Vegas ever. I believe it too based on the size, shape, and design of the interior.Luca's serves up breakfast and Italian which is another oddity about the place because those two things in combination seems like a strange choice, but there you have it. They only serve breakfast until 10:30 so if you get there after that you've got to go with lunch options.They do offer a really cheap salad and pizza buffet, but I would say the choice and quality of this buffet do match the price tag. After all, you're going to get what you pay for. After looking this over I decided to go with an Italian sandwich that I really enjoyed. It was basically mozzarella and Italian meat with a tapenade spread on a delicious bread.The prices are pretty low and the service was nice so I would possibly be up for trying it again if I lived in the area. However, it wasn't so remarkable that I'd make a conscious effort to go again just on a return visit to Vegas.

While I don't think there is a river or a mirage anywhere near this place, there does always seem to a large puddle of water in the parking lot. At least I think there is, unless, it's a mirage. Hmmm...What isn't a mirage is a restaurant full of local Latino families and a sea of blue haired, varicose veined, AARP folks from Sun City. I should know. Cuz my Sun City living mom and dad love Rio Mirage. This is where me and mom let loose and bond over a couple margs. While dad sips his ice tea and flirts with the waitress. I've had good luck ordering the same thing here. Carne Asada with beans and tortillas. I kinda put the steak in the tortilla, roll it up with some fixins. Chew. Smile. Chug more margarita. Mom loves the grilled quesadilla and dad's finicky ordering style is accommodated with "ground beef tacos. Hard. Nothing fancy." We always get great service and I love the local vibe. And the margarita buzz gets me through an entire game of bridge with Big Daddy and Momma Jo!

Wow. Yeah, this isn't really my place. Lots of karaoke. Lots of weirdness. Not so bueno. I was in the bathroom and overheard two women discuss loudly the fact that their boyfriends had very specific physical problems which I would have preferred never having to overhear. The bartenders are nice, the regulars not so much. No Bombay Sapphire and the bartenders didn't even notice they had a Bombay dry gin getting dusty in the corner when I requested the Sapphire version.  I admit, I got out of here in a hurry. Probably won't be coming back.

Review Text :
It's all about the package. 3.5 stars.At the restaurant Pepin, of course.  I would not give them 4 stars based solely on the food.  3 stars for the food.  It was for the most part very good but not good enough to merit  say $37 bucks that I spent on a seafood stew over noodles that my daughter and I shared.  By the way, first time I've eaten octopus, is it supposed to be textured like steak on the inside, soft on the outside and a little slippery on the surface?  But I digress.The food was overpriced for the quality.  But when you throw in Flamenco dancing, live Spanish guitar, free dancing lessons and getting pictures of my kids on stage dancing flamenco, much more worth it.The sangria was nice as well.  We shared a pitcher.  Well, the kids didn't actually have any .  Did you know Sangria helps you dance?11/3Another happy hour Tuesday for me!  Today I wanted to try AZ 88 after all these years of intention.  On my way to AZ 88, I paused for a few moments to check out Pepin's menu.  (Couldn't help it- Pepin and AZ 88 sit adjacent to each other!)  While my mouth watered at the descriptions of tapas, I, almost reluctantly, continued on my way to original destination.  Wow!  AZ 88 was DEAD.  Awashed in white tables and chairs, with only about 6 employees and me indoors, this space was too sterile for me to occupy for too long.  Even if happy hour was offered (I asked- it isn't), I don't think I would've bothered.  Impersonal and unwelcoming were adjectives that came to mind.  I will have to come back at a later time in the day to see if a higher body count and more mood lighting help to warm me up to AZ 88.Back to Pepin!  Happy hour here meant 50% off all tapas and sangrias!  Ole!  HH also means one eats at the bar counter.  Not so ole!  Pepin definitely needs to spruce this area up!  I almost gave up on the idea, but I was hungry and the $15 three-cold tapas sampler had me intrigued.  Si!  That's $7.50 to try three different cold plates; I selected roasted red peppers and goat cheese, lamb w/ garlic and sun-dried tomatoes, and cured salmon w/ fresh onions and capers, on a bed of lettuce and drizzled w/ Spanish olive oil.  I was able to secure a glass of Rene Barbieri red for 50% off (orig. $6).  Muchas gracias!!  Before my cold tapas arrived, a basket of 4 fresh-from-the-oven dinner rolls appeared, w/ a delicious aioli to accompany them!  They were so wonderful, I decided I was going to take some home w/ me :)  Xavier, my Catalan server, even gave me fresh rolls (not yet warmed in the oven) to ensure that the finished product wouldn't be rock-hard and damage my ivories.  Aw, how considerate of Xavier!  (Good thing this Catalan was married... I quite favor the Spaniards.)  Back to the tapas!  After the delightfully crispy-crusty dinner rolls, I found the slice of bread that came with the red peppers and goat cheese dull.  Thick-cut and soggy.  So, I swiped off the goat cheese and slathered it on the dinner rolls, instead!  A potential disaster averted!  Ole!  The slices of lamb were also very tasty, w/ the sun-dried tomato pieces lending a chewy texture that isn't as bad as you might think.  My favorite of the three was the cured salmon w/ capers!  With a twist of lemon, this app was simply perfect!  Yes, I'd recommend this dish to anyone.  Anyone, that is, that doesn't find fish repulsive...Hasta la vista, Pepin!  I'll be back soon to try the calamari!Terrible.I brought my boyfriend here a while ago for a romantic date out.  I thought it would be great because they had vegetarian paella for me and plenty of fish and meat for him to try.  (He doesn't normally get to do that too much since we go to mostly vegetarian places).We got an appetizer, two entrees, and some sangria, and even with a $25 gift card, the bill was still over $90 with tip.  Now, this would not have been an issue had the food been worth that.  However, the food was terrible.  It was stuck in the 80's.  The beau's chicken looked like something you would get on an airplane, and my paella could have been shown up by something in a box... mushy rice with frozen veg.  The server also charged us for 2 salads that she just brought out.  I don't mind paying for a salad, but at least ask me!At one point in our meal, my man got up and went to the restroom.  When he returned, he told me that I HAD to go look at it.  It was awful.  It was worse than any drive bars I have been to.  The paint was falling off the walls, one of the stalls didn't have a door and the other barely locked, the toilets were filthy, and the sink was disgusting.  If you charge $20-$40 a plate, you need to have the ambiance to back it up.Never go here.I bought a Groupon dinner for two as a Christmas gift for my mother.  Bad move!  Mom was upset enough to write her own bad review of the restaurant.  (I didn't even know she had a Yelp account!)The deal sounds great... $49 for a dinner for two, valued at up to $104. This includes two entrees, a pitcher of sangria, and an appetizer.  ("This must be some fancy restaurant," I thought. "What a nice gift for my Mom!")Well, she ended up not taking her boyfriend, but instead took her sister and sister's husband.  Therefore, instead of two, there were three at the table. Unfortunately, Pepin could not handle this change gracefully, and when placing the order everybody became confused with the Groupon deal.I wish they just told my mother... "Your order for three is going to exceed the value of this coupon, which is for a dinner for two. The coupon is for any two dinners, one appetizer, and one pitcher of sangria.  Since you're ordering more, we'll give you the maximum credit for your coupon, which is worth up to $104." That would have been simple.Instead, they made billing seem complicated, causing the customer to have to think too much about the bill. They didn't give the full value of the Groupon and they added a mandatory 20% gratuity on the bill (for three people).Looking back at the deal... They gave her most of the value of the coupon. The meal cost a lot more than she calculated partially because she didn't calculate the value of each item they ordered, partially because the mandatory 20% gratuity was a large, unexpected change, and partially because the prices are over-inflated ($32 for a pitcher of sangria?).I paid $49 for the deal, and Mom paid $86 in excess. For a total of $135 (supposedly 50% off), my Mom and her two guests received one entree each. They shared a single appetizer, a single dessert, and a single pitcher of sangria.  That's pretty spendy, and for that much money, you'd think everyone would leave feeling satisfied with the experience of the food and the service.  Instead, my Mom thought it was a rip off, and I'm left regretting my purchase.

Review Text :
Caffe Boa is a hidden gem on Mill Avenue, for both eating, drinking and relaxing with friends. It's a little bit on the pricey side though, so take advantage of the happy hour and half-priced sangria Sundays.It used to be a tiny, homey little cafe next to Long Wong's at 7th Street and Mill and has since been converted into a spacious, classy winery and Italian bistro at 4th Street and Mill.Happy hour specials are only extended to the bar area, which is tiny in comparison to the rest of the area. There's the traditional happy hour from 5 to 7, and a reverse happy hour that begins after 10 pm. (Check which days this is available though, because I'm not sure it's daily.) Draft beers like Guiness and Harp are two bucks, wine by the glass is half off (3 to 6 bucks after the discount), as are their fancy pants cocktails (generally 5 bucks)--the espresso martini is decadent--and all appetizers aside from the huge cheese plate are half priced. One wonky thing about the tab for happy hour is that they take the discount off at the end, so just keep a running tab in your head of how much you owe if you're with a group to make things go a little smoother.I'm in lust with the Shrimp Adriatico, which is an appetizer that has five big tiger shrimp swimming in garlic tomato sauce that's served with a loaf of bread for dipping. It's filling enough to serve as an entire meal, or to share among friends.On Sundays, pitchers of sangria are half priced ($15 instead of $30) and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. I prefer the white wine over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced apples and muddled citrus. Make sure to ask them to go easy on the cinnamon though, or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.Dinner is always divine as well, but a little bit on the pricey side. The meals are huge though, so you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers or you can split an entre with another person for an extra 3 buck charge. The Voodoo Penne is a delicious Cajun flavored dish, Lucas' Meatballs are savory and filling, and the Pola Pola is some awesome artichoke ravioli. Everything is done well and I rarely encounter problems with the servers or bartenders.It's a nice, mellow break from the hubbub of Mill Avenue.***UPDATE***I've been a little peeved lately at the happy hour, since it's only extended to the bar and the bar is so damn tiny. Now I understand that if I don't get there around 5 I have no chance of getting a seat. That's fine. But the damn Chase employees get there around 4:30 (before Happy Hour even starts, where's the logic in that?) and hog all the damn seats, leaving me with nothing but shattered hope and an empty glass. You better shape up, Caffe Boa, or I'm docking a star!***UPDATE***You've been docked a star Boa. You went and increased the prices of your entrees by three bucks at the very least. Fuck you and your scrumtious, mouth watering 19 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. They're fucking meatballs, Boa! Plus your half price on glasses of wine less than 10 bucks is a pretty useless deal now. Jeezy creezy.This isn't goodbye though. I'll still chill with you on Sundays for the sangria, but I shall never indulge in the pola pola, voodoo penne or your shitty Willow Bakery bread again. Bastards.I enjoyed Caffe Boa.  Really, I did.  I just think it has an identity crisis going on.  Is this Mill or is this Scottsdale?  Why does an Italian restaurant only have one pinot grigio and why is it from Argentina?  Who living next to ASU, other than professors, can pay $100 per person for a special dinner event? (And even if you could, why here?) What's with the hipster bartenders in the Italian wine bar?All that being said the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.  We went for happy hour before heading off to a friend's party and followed Erica's advice.  Sit at the bar, get there by 4:30.  Done and done.  (Btw, their happy hour now runs from 4-7)  The tap beers are $2 (and we're talking Guinness, Harp, Stella...), and half off apps (except for the cheese plate) and glasses of wine under $10 ( of course the one wine I wanted was $10.25.  Grrrr.)  The bartenders are really serious about making good drinks, I started with a watermelon martini and watched the bartender muddle the watermelon.  It was fantastic.  They had a ton of fresh fruit to muddle with behind the bar.  The only part of the night I didn't enjoy drink-wise was when one of the bartenders poured me half of a glass of champagne.  Also on Erica's recommendation we ordered the shrimp and the antipasto, both were fantastic.  But I couldn't believe there was literally only two slices of each meat, cheese, and veggie, it definitely would not have been worth it for full price.  But the olives, prosciutto and salami were all great.  My husband is not usually a prosciutto fan (whereas I could eat a pound of it in 10 minutes if you let me) but he liked theirs because it was well cured and sliced thick.  After our 2 apps, 2 glasses of wine, 3 martinis, 2 black and tans, and a glass of champagne we were ready to head out.  What was the charge for this feast? $46.  Yes, indeed, I will definitely be at this happy hour again.  Or on a Sunday when pitchers of sangria are half off - only $15 instead of $30.Update:I have come to the conclusion that Caffe Boa has the best happy hour ever.  It is a grad student's dream come true.  Amazing drink and app specials in place where your feet don't stick to the floor?  Yes please.  All of my visits here have ended with me laughing at the final bill.  4 glasses of cava for $14?   I do not think I would ever come here outside of happy hour though.  None of the appetizers are large enough to warrant their full price and that doesn't bode well for the entrees.Oh and I'm happy to report that they now have a pinot grigio from Italy.  Its quite good. :)Caffe Boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day.The service is so bad it makes the Terminal 4 baggage claim at Sky Harbor look like its staffed by nothing but Jackie Chan clones.  Thats means Boa is slooooooow, folks.I'm befuddled by the mystery of their menu, trying to discern if what beautiful items I appeared to order are actually what's in front of me.  Ogerp Pasta?  Oh, yeah, i get it.  Its Prego cleverly spelled backwards.  Next on the list Etnom Led Asparagus (apparently, some region in Tuscany).People are always up on their shit about their happy hour, which I makes my eyes roll right out of my head, because:1)  Their bar is about as big as a Subaru Vivio.2)  Their specials ONLY apply when sitting in the Vivio.3)  There are certainly no helpful chauffeurs.  Fortunately for me, its pretty far out of the way, which makes it almost certain that I can have some excuse for not driving all the way to Tempe to be spared to death.I remember when Cafe Boa was affordable. The agnolotti boa was $12.95, half that for their panini's.. Imagine my shock to learn my favorite dish is now $17.95.. For mushroom filled pasta.. Really? They do have a great wine list but it too is on the high price sides and their tasting are a pretentious $100 cover - get real.My last experience deserves 1 * but I give 2 *s because the food is still great. I went alone and sat at a table for about 15 minutes before I could get eye contact, let alone a glass of water.  My meal and a glass of wine was an outrageous $34 - FOR LUNCH! Don't get me wrong the food is good, but the service generally sucks. I recommend going on Sundays when apps and sangria are half off. There are just too many great, authentic places to go to put up with the price and lack of creativity in their dishes.Kristin S has always raved about this place as being an amazing happy hour spot, so my husband and I met her, as well as Melissa H and her husband, there for some discounted appetizers and drinks. Since Kristin had mentioned that the bar fills up really quickly during happy hour (which happens everyday from 4 - 7 pm), those of us who could arrive around 4:30 did. It didn't end up being that crowded after all, but given that the only bar-area seating consists of seats at the smallish bar and a few high tables, I would still recommend arriving as early as you can so that you don't end up missing the great happy hour deals. All of us ended up finding a drink deal that fit our mood at the moment: Melissa and her husband got some draft beer for only $2, Kristin took advantage of the wine specials (50% of wine by the glass), and my husband and I each sampled two signature cocktails that were discounted from $12 to $8. The Prosciutto e Melone and XXX martinis were good but not spectacular, but we both thought that the Anastasia (vodka, basil, and muddled strawberries) and the Blueberry Lemon Drop (with fresh blueberries) were distinctive and delicious. Next time, we'll probably have wine and beer, though, so we can really experience how cheap Caffe Boa's happy hour can be!In terms of food, the following appetizers are 50% off during happy hour: bruschetta, antipasto platter, Shrimp Adriatico, and Capriatta (essentially a Caprese salad). Since all of these appetizers (except for the antipasto platter, which is normally $15) are usually $6 - $10, you can truly eat well for cheap! We tried all of these four apps except for the Capriatta. I especially enjoyed the Shrimp Adriatico's spicy and savory tomato-based sauce (excellent to dip bread in!) and the antipasto platter was presented well and featured some high-quality meats, cheeses, and vegetables. As everyone has already said, Caffe Boa's happy hour offers discounted and good drinks and appetizers in an non-Mill Avenue environment. I doubt I'll return for dinner, but I will definitely stop by the bar area between 4 and 7 at some point soon!Remember when Caffe Boa was right on Mill, next to Red Lantern and Long Wong's? Remember when they were doing inventive, handmade pastas with fresh sauces and always had great specials? Remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail? REMEMBER THE AGNOLOTTI?? There was nothing like it in Tempe at the time.Yeah, it ain't that anymore. Every red sauce tastes like Ketchup and melted margarine. Every food object tastes like Sysco. I swear there are still ice crystals in the shrimp. It's now a place for college kids to play grown-up date night, and former fans to hang their heads in sadness. I guess it serves its purpose as more of a college bar/practice restaurant. And its crowd is pleased with its easily-digested mediocrity. But I still lament the passing of the original, inspired Boa.RIP Boa.Now that I no longer live alone, I try to embrace any me time I can find, therefore eating alone is one of my very favorite things to do. Even though sitting solo makes people look at you like you have 23 heads and/or brings sympathetic half assed smiles, I truly love it. The other day, while walking down Mill (after a very successful interview), I stumbled upon Cafe Boa.. all I can say is fn fyeah!It is a lot "fancier" than I had expected. My goal for the afternoon was to find a delicious salad and a glass of good wine. Not only did I find that here (I had the butter cup lettuce with grilled chicken breast, sliced almonds, avocado, heirloom tomato & sunflower sprouts topped with champagne/lemon vinaigrette), but I also found delicious bread served with hummus, olive oil from Queen Creek, the best Calamata olives I've ever eaten (to start) AND the most delicious Pomegranate iced tea in the whole entire world. Seriously, whatever you choose from the menu, try the Pom Tea, its to die for. The menu has some delicious unique options and their wine list is enormous. There aren't many offered just by the glass so since I am a Cabernet girl, I tried the Girard (Napa Valley, CA 2006).. I was a fan. The service was wonderful, and my waiter was very helpful and informative. Also really really good looking so that was a plus. Everyone in here was smiling, laughing and generally enjoying the whole atmosphere. I would really like to come here after work to split a bottle and try the fresh oysters, heirloom carrot soup and Rosemary ravioli they have available at some point too.. now that its so close to my new office and all. :o)Cafe Boa is extremely inexpensive for the options they have, and is pretty much a hidden gem (literally, its kinda hard to find). I see myself returning again and again and again.For 2 years Caffe Boa was my go to HH place.  My friends and I would meet here for many reasons- to celebrate the completion of a big assignment, a new job or promotion, the end of tough a week, a drink before a  VMarie show, Wednesday.  I brought my parents, my in-laws, and friends visiting from out of town to HH here.   It was our spot.What in the name of the Happy Hour gods happened here? I remember a time where you got an entire loaf of bread and a bowl of olive oil.  They replaced that with three dipping sauces and a bread basket...I took it in stride.  Then it just became passed bread, which was rough but I was still able to use the bread to soak up the adriatico sauce.  On my last trip we had to ask several times  for bread.  They used to have so many good wines on HH.  Oh, how I loved those wines.  Now they have a handful of their worst ones.  No more of my favorite Albarino.  No more Cava.Then there was the food.  My friends and I would always order several orders of shrimp adriatico, which was full of plump jumbo shrimp.   The various cheese/tomato based plates were large enough for 4 to share.  What we were served on our last visit was tiny shrimp, that did not seem fresh, in a meager amount of sauce. The capriatta was now a slice of bread with cheese on it and was large enough, maybe, for 2 to cut up and share.  I almost cried when we were last there.  It was a terrible HH in general, made worse by the fact that I sat there knowing how great it once was.  Now my friends and I are in the market for a new HH spot.12/03/09Decided I'd go to CB to find out once and for all what roasted veal marrow tasted like after hearing a couple of Food Network celebrity chefs hark on and on about how wonderful they are (Anne Burrell, in particular, spoke of it on an episode of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate").  I'd have to say that I didn't think much of them.  The presentation was beautiful, I must admit, but paying $10 for what amounted to about a teaspoon and a half (OK, for argument's sake, let's round it off to two teaspoons) of frothy fat accented with Hawai'ian sea salt and tawny port reduction did not translate to a great experience for me (taste, nutrition, or cost).  Sure, there were a bit of bitter greens and three toasted pieces of bread (which two teaspoons of fat could not even cover), but I found more joy and sustenance w/ the singular toast slice slathered w/ goat cheese (forgive me, it's been awhile since I had this app, but the spread could've been mascarpone and ricotta, but I want to say goat cheese) and slices of Campari tomatoes.  Happy hour price for this app was $4.50, which I found easier to swallow, pardon the pun, than to pay $9 for a singular slice of toast w/ a soft-cheese spread and a little bitter greens on top.  (I can't eat tomatoes, so those gourmet slices just ended up in the garbage bin.)  It was very tasty, however, so I may order it again, but I won't be very happy about it.  Perhaps I could get a substitute for the tomatoes?  I will ask next time I go.3.5 stars I see the potential in Caffe Boa. I can see that they've recently changed the menu and the chef and are making strides toward becoming a fantastic restaurant. They just aren't there quite yet, in my opinion. My first visit to the "new" Caffe Boa was the first week the new chef Peyton Curry (formerly of Digestif fame) got started. I walked in to secure a table and was asked for my first and last name...weird right? How many Dottsy's do they get? So I went to sit at the bar to wait for my dinner partner to arrive. I sat and sat and watched the bartender tend to one end of the bar. Finally, a gentleman raised his voice and told the kid that I have been waiting patiently for a drink. A broken glass later, I secured a glass of prosecco. Soon after, my dinner partner arrived and I wanted to cash out because our table was ready. I waved my credit card at the bartender and he took his time coming over. Dude, if you don't want to serve me, then come cash me out so I'm out of your hair! Sheesh. We were seated in the a beautiful dining area. The restaurant was packed with patrons and buzzing. Our waitress came to introduce herself and take our drink orders. I also ordered the pulled mozzarella to start. It arrived at our table and it was just your average mozz. Nothing mind-blowing. For my entree I had the Diver Scallops that were accompanied by a potato puree. The scallops were cooked perfectly. I guess the dish is an exercise in subtlety because nothing wowed me. It was an a-ok dish. It was almost pushing on bland. The puffed capers might have saved the dish. I tried my friend's pasta, and it was semi-cold. He was a better sport than I, and chose not to return it. What threw me was that we were sitting right next to the kitchen door. How long was that pasta sitting in the kitchen getting cold? All in all, the dinner was good. Certainly nothing super creative, but definitely tasty. I returned to Boa for lunch. I ordered the Kobe burger with blue cheese. How do I say this gently? It was a salt lick. The cheese was VERY salty to be put on top of a seasoned burger. I only ate half of it an I was over it. I did fill out a comment card and also told our waitress about it. No offer for a new sandwich, but I did eat half of it. I see the potential for Caffe Boa. It's all there. A good chef, quality ingredients, a creative menu, but they're not all coming together quite right. Maybe a tasting dinner with comment cards might be in order. Or maybe, given time, Caffe Boa will become a roaring success. I will be waiting.Café Boa you've lost me. I vow to never return (except for happy hour). I was disappointed at my last lunch experience and this one takes the cake. You're food has not changed yet every time I go in you jack up the prices and limit my options . I miss my old modest reliable Boa. This new Boa is arrogant and shameless. I went in today, and saw that now my ONLY lunch options are "30 Minute Meals". So choose soup or salad, choose 1 pasta or 1 sandwich and dessert and this does not include a drink.  All for the special price of $19. I felt specially taken advantage of and specially pissed off. It wasn't even any choice of pasta/sandwich, it was Agnolotti Boa or Pastrami. And who do you know that eats dessert for lunch? NO ONE! This new menu is as ridiculous as the prices for average food. Sure there are paninis under $10, but pair that with a salad (not a side salad you have to order a full portion for $9) and the prices make you ponder why you walked in the door.Here's a tip - Go look at the menu at House of Tricks and put yourself in check, or perhaps talk to your manager/chef about coming to reality and getting back to your roots.Oh Caffe Boa, what happened to you? I used to love you, like seriously love you but christ how you've changed! I know, I know, you've gotten yourself a fancy big-named chef and  in turn completely forgotten your identity. Case in point: A $19 lunch SPECIAL? Is that some sort of joke?? Your lunch "special" will run me $20 without even purchasing a drink? Doesn't sound very special to me. Caffe Boa has turned into an expense accounter's establishment only with their insanely unrealistic pricing which has increased dramatically over the last several years. Inflation is one thing but this is price-gouging at its finest. Plain, meatless pasta entrees don't increase in price 60+% over 5 years due to inflation and higher food costs, they just don't.Again, I used to love Caffe Boa. I spent just about every celebratory dinner I had in college there. Shit, I even hosted one of my graduation parties there! But those days are over. I find it incredibly ironic that I used to be able to afford Caffe Boa in college when I was on a strict budget, and years later I'm working and have more disposable funds at my leisure and it has firmly priced itself out of my budget. Crying shame...It took me a while to make my way to Caffe Boa, but I finally did it.  I went for dinner last night with my husband and brother, and we were all impressed!  (We were huge Payton Curry fans when he was at Digestif so I don't know why it took us so long to go see his new home).Despite calling ahead, and several tables appearing open in the dining room, we were sent to the bar when we arrived and told it would be "just a few minutes."  I was ok with that, especially once I had a delicious glass of malbec in my hand!  We were seated about ten or fifteen minutes later, and we must've hit the jackpot because Trevor was our server and he was attentive, friendly, and not afraid to make recommendations.The boys and I had different menu items in mind, so they shared a ton of things (fries and bolgnese as appetizers, a special mangalitsa head cheese as the next course, and then linguini, and quail entrees).  I tried almost all of their courses and ordered the day boat fish, which was sole in parchment paper served with quinoa, as my entree.  My fish was delicious, and quite a large portion too.  So was everything else I tasted except for the head cheese... Sorry Chef, but that was not my cup of tea... it's just not for everyone, I guess!We were all stuffed but managed to share dessert which included an incredible pumpkin macaroon, something chocolate, and caramel corn with fleur de sel.  I let the boys take down the macaroon and chocolate and I enjoyed every morsel of the popcorn!Will definitely be back on a Saturday or Sunday to take advantage of CB's bottomless mimosas / bellinis.Not cool!!!  I've only ever visited the Phoenix location and had outstanding food and service. Tonight has been COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!  We were entertaining clients and the experience couldn't have been worse. I made the reservation for 11 a week in advance. We arrived at 6pm and had clients who had to catch planes at 9pm. It took more than 45 minutes to take our order.  At 8pm after repeated requests on the status of our order and communicating that we had travelers on a tight schedule we were told that one of the entrees was burned and it would take longer.  When we then asked to speak to the manager so we could explain the situation, we were given nothing but attitude. At that point we had had enough and got up to leave.  The owner met us at the door and threatened to call the police if we didn't pay the bill. He then offered to give us $200 in gift certificates. Hmmmmm.... Why can't he just accept his mistake and take care of the bill?  At least we would have given this place a second chance. Instead he refused to provide customer service and told us not to tell him how to run his business!  As we stood outside and argued with him for 15 minutes, 3 other parties left and told us it took over 2 hours for them to get their food. Come on people!  I understand that mistakes happen, but for crying out loud just fix it!!! I will NEVER set foot in this place again, and I'm guessing neither will the other 30 people who exited along with us.I took advantage of the groupon and took a party of 7 for lunch today. The menu online stated "CHOOSE ANY 2 ITEMS, COMBINATION OF SOUP, SALAD, PASTA FOR $9.95" Of course when we got there that was no longer on the menu. We were looking at $16 pastas once again.Not one person in my group was pleased with their meal. I ordered the burger and it was burnt to a crisp as was the bun, my friend ordered the same burger medium and it was burnt on the outside and bloody in the center. I could actually take the burger and only use half of the bun the amount of meat was so small. The pasta salad it was served with was bland, the vegetable sandwich was the ass end of the veggies. All in all everything was less than acceptable. I gave you another chance Boa, and while you boast of fresh quality ingredients you don't deliver on quality food or realistic prices. Sadly I won't be back.

Overhyped and I don't know why.  Unless maybe those kids whose parents used the "electronic babysitter" too much grew up and found a place to feel at home - substitute a beer for the bottle, plop in front of TV.Selection of beers on tap had a couple of nice choices, but c'mon, if I'm going to have to pay $6.75 for a large so-called premium/import draft, I'd better be having a little more skin shaking in my face than I'd care to have from these "Santisi Girls".  I'm sure they're nice young ladies, but I don't see coming here for the benefit of their obligatory company or vacant personalities, even if I was a single horny young 21 yo dude.Saw a few small groups having fun with darts and pool balls, and a few lost souls at the bar.  Mostly I saw a few of the staff working hard (a busser and a waitress) while the rest of the folks in SB tshirts milled around and chit chatted each other up.There weren't many people when I was there kind of late on I can't remember if a Sunday or weeknight.  The lighting was quite bright, allowing me to see all that grime and slime that normally goes unnoticed in this type of place.  What you don't know CAN hurt you, but even so, ignorance is bliss, so I'm only eating in *dimly lit* sports bars from now on.   That lighting is there for a reason, and it's not just to cause you the lovely surprise of waking up hung over next to a sasquatch after a night of binge drinking with your community college "frat" buddies. I need a call out from my man, Flavor-Flav, BOYEEEEEEEE!!, cuz this one's made the Don't Believe the Hype List.I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night.  Yep, I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit.  We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know it's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.For a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.This is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too.Good food, bad service and please keep your opiinions to yourself!I visited this bar because I heard about the good atmosphere, food, and the number of TV's for the many sports you can watch.  I favorite thing is that it cooks that good old world Italian food.  I lived in Kansas City where there is a good amount of Italians there and being in Arizona that food seems hard to find.  Santisit's has that good Italian family food packaged in a sports bar and not the traditional Italian family restaurant.  Kudos for that now on to the next.  I visited this place twice over the last week and have received bad service and got insulted on the second visit.  On 07/19 with my fiancee.  We ordered a antipasto salad and a stromboli.  We arrived at 3pm and did not receive our order until 3:45.  I believe the only reason we received that because they over heard the conversation that I was going to leave if the food was not out by 3:45.  I was surprised it took so long to bring the food out and especially a salad.  They could have just brought that out first since that was so simple to make.  We were out on Lake Pleasant that day out in the hot sun for about 4 hours and we grew an appetite.  However, we received the food and it was great.  I visited this place again on 07/23 for happy hour after doing some after hours work and I felt really insulted by the bartender that day and I didn't finish my food that day.  I arrived at there around 5:30pm and order a Michelob Ultra and a stromboli again.  Keep in mind that I am a heavyset guy and my bartender was a skinny 130lbs older lady probably around in her 50's.  She brings my order and looks at the plate and makes a remark saying, "That would last me about 3 days".  I did not understand why she said that but I paid it no mind until I was ready to go.  I only ate half of the plate and when I asked her to package my plate she makes another remark, "I'm suprised you didn't eat the whole thing".  I left the place shocked and insulted.  It took a lot to keep me from cursing this lady out.  I could not believe that she would inpose her opinion on me because I'm heavyset that I just gouge food.  I know that there is a LOT of peope here who gets crazy about this FAT phobia but if it does not affect you, the please don't worry about it.  It's my life and I can do what I want to do.  In addition, you are not a medical professional and you don't know why a person is overweight to begin with.  Even the doctor's themselves do not completely know what causes a person to be overweight becasue if they did 80 percent of adult Americans would not be fat.  This bar really pissed me off and I will not ever go back there again.  On the first time, shame on me but a second time, shame on you.  If the food wasn't good I would probably rate this place a one star.  Please train your staff to pay attention to your customers and be more couretous.  Thanks.

Review Text :
My daughter brought me here for a belated Father's day lunch. Wow! I couldn't believe my eyes. Almost drove right by. Complete and total make over inside and out. Even a new electric sign out front. They must have got new deep fryers too...the food tasted better than usual. You can actually see shrimp inside the crust. I got a 7 piece lunch combo. (5 shrimp and 2 oysters) with a pile of fries and Pete's sauce. I brought some Tabasco with me to spice it up a little.  My daughter had the 3 piece fish and chips. Everything was hot and crispy and the oysters were plump and juicy. Make sure you bring cash though, CASH ONLY! They have an ATM on site but will hit you up for $2.50. I will be returning more often cash in hand. Hope you all do the same. Order the oysters...Plump and juicy but be careful when you bite into it or you will squirt hot juice everywhere!  ENJOY!Came back again on Mon. around noon with my 2 daughters and grand daughter in tow for our Pete's fix. Nothing much has changed from my previous reviews and updates save two! The shrimp are now a little smaller overall but larger pieces of shrimp inside the batter and the prices have gone up! Our order of fish combo (2 fish, 5 shrimp and fries), 7 piece shrimp and fries and 8 piece chicken nuggets came to $21.80 not counting $2  ATM charge for cash. Got our food quickly and piping hot even during lunch rush! Be careful if you go, lots of road work on Van Buren in front of Pete's and other businesses! Prob be awhile for our next fix!

It's the last day to claim those Entertainment book coupons and after finding out Siena Bistro was closed for a private event, we headed to Las Islitas #3.  Their banner outside advertised lunch specials starting from $5.99, Monday through Friday.   I had already called ahead and learned that their seafood dishes were not part of the coupon special.  After looking through their menu, it left us with very few choices.  (Their specialty is seafood, so the majority of the menu had some kind of seafood in it.)  On the back page of the menu were a few meat dishes so we stuck with that selection.The waitress had already brought over tortilla chips, salsa, and fresh limes.  (The Big F really liked their tortilla chips and I found their salsa with just the right amount of heat.)  We were more than hungry by the time our food arrived.The Big F ordered the Carne en su Jugo ($14.95) "beef stew with bacon, onion and green sauce" - The first thing I tried was their refried beans and was impressed.  Sure, they don't give much rice, and they really should give more beans because it's that good!  It's so creamy and unlike other refried beans I've had.  The Big F thought the beef stew was different, and liked it a lot.  His plate was licked clean.I tried their Fajitas de Res ($14.95) "beef fajitas" - It came with either corn or flour tortillas, and I chose the flour kind.  Chunky pieces of beef with red and green bell peppers, onions, and some other red vegetable.  It was a pretty filling dish, and I had enough for leftovers.  The Big F found the beef to be a bit dry, but I loaded it with salsa and hot sauce, so I couldn't really tell.We were definitely curious about their seafood dishes since we saw other diners enjoying themselves on generous dishes of ceviche.  Overall, we were surprisingly pleased with our lunch.  We went in the afternoon, so it wasn't too busy.  We were probably more bugged with the 'no seafood' part, so we couldn't really enjoy what they offered if we wanted to take advantage of that coupon.  Oh well.  Next time!American Express not accepted.3.5 stars.(Pics posted!)

In light of the recent news and video of a Dos Gringos bouncer punching a patron in the face, I thought I should ring in on this establishment....This bar treats its customers like they are college kids. I suppose they are somewhat justified in this since it is typically a younger crowd. I've had mixed experiences coming here... in the past, I've had acceptable and decent service here, but the last several times I've been there the service has gotten progressively worse. On the last occasion, they took forever to take my drink order and then poured me the wrong drink... then when I went to politely return the full glass of whatever and get what I ordered, they refused to re-make it. I left it on the bar and they threw it away (keeping my money of course) and gave me a dirty look. I also had aggressive bar backs shove me out of the way. That experience alone was enough for me to never go back, but it wasn't an isolated incident. It wasn't always that way though... The staff in general here all seem to be complete assholes, but I can almost recall a time when they were decent to me - back in the 1990s. It's a pity because this bar is in a great building and has a fun layout. It's breezy and open and conducive to having a good time drinking after work with your buddies. My old roommate used to hit this place often with his corporate pals and he loved the atmosphere. They do make their drinks pretty strong, so maybe he was too trashed to care about the bad service. In their defense, their patrons are often rowdy, young, and unruly - so that's probably why it has evolved into this. I've found the Tempe location to be more laid back though, so it's still pretty excessive if you ask me. I have to give this place an extra star because it's still a good place for young folks to go grab a beer and chill. I think this punch in the face incident may get them to reevaluate their staff and maybe give them all sensitivity training or something. It can only get better from here.As a first time Yelper, I thought it was my duty to pick out the most memorable experience from my recent jaunt to the Scottsdale bars to house my post.  I am not what you would call a bar fly.  I am more of a stay at home, curled up with a book kind of gal. The whole "Scottsdale Scene" leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  On this particular Friday night I was torn from the solace of my couch by a group of friends for a night on the town.  We began our evening in the Northeast part of Old Town amongst the neon lights of the newly constructed string of bars.  Giddy with anticipation of what our night would bring, we strolled into HIFI.  Being a stranger to the nightlife I was disappointed to find the service rude.  The bartenders seemed almost put out that I had the audacity to order a cocktail.  Let alone, the ever complicated vodka soda with a lemon.  I was assured by the rest of my group that was par for the course and I should be thankful the bartender chose to bestow her attention on me instead of the bar-back she was previously talking to. Far be it from me to rock the boat I smiled, thanked her, apologized to the bar-back and drank my $10 drink in silence, eyes cast to the floor.  Rinse and repeat for the next 2 hours on that side of town.  Some places better than others, though all having an air of superiority I didn't quite understand.  Fast forward to midnight, tired of battling aggressive V necks, we made our way across Scottsdale road.  The bright neon lights from the eastside of the street had nothing on the sparkling Christmas lights of Craftsman Court.  Making our way into Dos Gringos we were greeted at the door by a bearded gent with a friendly, "Hello."   This is one of the larger bars I have been to in Scottsdale.  There were 3 different bars operating downstairs and one upstairs, which was not open on this particular night.  The place was crowded, yet we were promptly served with a smile as soon as we stepped up to the bar.  The tall red headed fellow handled my intricate concoction of vodka and soda water with ease.  We made our way to the back of the bar. The atmosphere was very inviting. The rhythm was right, I had my dancin' shoes on and me and your girl was booty shakin'.  There was more room in the back so our group posted up here for the rest of the night.  The music was excellent and all of the patrons seemed to be having a fantastic time, ourselves included.  All the bartenders, guys and gals alike, made us feel welcome and seemed happy to have us there. We were never without a beverage, and I never felt I was putting anyone out to have my glass refilled.  Fueled with laughs, the warmth of friendship, and something called Fireball, the sobering task of closing my tab crept up on me in the night.  I reached for the black check presenter with fear in my heart.  Already taking mental stock of my unpaid bills for the month, I opened the small book at the same time deciding Southwest Gas would have to wait for their money yet another paycheck. I was pleasantly surprised at the affordability of the libations.  My cat Gary and I would stay warm in spite of my poor decision making skills.  I paid my bill, left a generous tip, one that I thought was well deserved and was a direct reflection on the service I had received, and staggered my way into a taxi in the back ally.  I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a pretentious-free night out on the town.  Thank you Dos Gringos and staff for making one the few nights that I get out a great one!  I'll be back for sure.

Review Text :
I hadn't been to this place in over 12 years so I decided to take hubby to try it out and see if it was still any good. There is no drive-thru, this is a small little building where you walk-up and place your order. If there is actual parking for this place someone let me know because it seems people still just pull up along the curb, hop out and order, get their food then roll out. I just figure the parking situation adds adventure to the experience ha! There is seating right outside of the ordering window which is nice, if mother nature is being nice :)As I walked up to the window I immediately recognized the owner. He is a character for sure! He let me know he was celebrating 18 years in the same location. I told him I had read in the Review Journal a few years back that Celine Dion liked to stop at Hot Dog Heaven for a hot dog on her way home. The owner had an immediate response that had both my husband and myself laughing so hard! I'd repeat what he said, but it might not be appropriate so just trust me it was hilarious or ask yourself next time you stop by! So I ordered a "Vienna All Beef Hot Dog" priced at $2.79 on the menu board, but I was charged $2.89 before taxes. It's only 10 cents, but still the prices should be listed correctly. I asked for mine loaded so it came on a poppy seed bun and had a pickle, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers and true green relish. I asked for the celery salt to be left off.  This hot dog was as good as I remembered it. It really is a simple thing yet hits the spot. I also ordered "Chili Cheese Fries" priced at $4.19 and the chili cheese fries only come in one size unlike the plain fries. The chili cheese fries can easily be shared between 2 or more people. The chili is made from scratch and being a Chicago joint there is no beans in the chili. The chili was pretty good, but not as good as Original Tommy's. The fries are nice and fat so they hold up the chili and cheese nicely. Hubby ordered a "Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog" that was priced on the menu at $4 and some change, yet I was charged $5.19 for it before tax. Look, I really don't mind paying whatever you are charging if it is fair, but it needs to be posted correctly or it is just misleading and people will wonder about shadiness. They serve Coca-Cola here as well Barq's root beer if that is your thing.They only take CA$H MONEY for payment, so stop at a bank or have some cash on you because cash is king at this place.

Cuz a foot isn't long enough!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1bALsE6aZE23mGV2WPxN_g?select=anOeubumuKq8jHiIMbHi3wI had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. It feels alot more family run and friendly here.Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami! * about 7 min from the strip a little past the PalmsCute little sandwich shop behind the McDonalds on Decatur & flamingo, small but still kinda cozy, the people that work here are cool and friendly. I got a small meal (the Bobbie meal) so the price was cheap... they don't have sprite, coke, Pepsi, just Mountain Dew & 7up. They don't have any 'name brand chips' here either which isn't a big deal at all to the norm but if your a foodie like me... I like to have my variety of flavorful chips. I wanted to see what all the buzz about the Bobbie was about, I liked the combination of cranberry, stuffing, turkey, & mayo (because you can't even taste the mayo) but it honestly wasn't a wow factor. It was a good meal with okay prices, next time ill bring my hot sauce bottle. P.S. they don't carry avocado.

What you gonna do? It's fast food. Very basic and devoid of character.  The only saving grace here is the communal salsa bar.  Sure fine, this place is alright, not disgusting or the best ever.  Just as average as you can get.
Blue Nile Cafe=I began my love affair with Ethiopian food last year when I went to visit a friend in New York and he opened my eyes to the delights of this interesting, yet amazing food.I'm not sure if I can actually classify it a "love affair" being that I have only been three times now, but it is what it feels like. With my recent gluten allergy, it has been terrible finding carbs and luckily the Injera bread is 100% gluten free (it is made with teff) so I can eat to my hearts desire!Another really neat thing about Blue Nile is that they serve a small raw menu every day, and a full blown raw menu on Sunday and Monday. I don't know of anywhere else in the valley that does this, so definitely a great thing to see! I cannot wait to come back and try their raw creations. That is, if you can pull me away from the injera :-)Now, the one drawback that ALMOST turns this place from a 5 to a 4 is that they have the scariest parking lot I have ever seen. I made Dallas G. watch me walk back to the car, in broad daylight, just to ensure I was not accosted. Well, that, and I have a great ass ;-)Oooo and they have this magical tea that has such a unique flavor. I absolutely love it!Extremely affordable, very tasty, great service... WINNER!!!!!My first introduction to Ethopian food, and I can remember it like it was yesterday.  It's interesting and unusual, but nothing about it could be offensive.  It's just not *that* weird, despite how it looks and the way you eat it.  I don't know if I would recommend going for your first time w/out someone who's been before.  I wish it was served at a higher temperature and that the men's room had been stocked w/ paper towels, but otherwise I have no complaints and look forward to returning.  As a side note, the hummus here is excellent, and I would recommend starting with it if you're a little nervous about the whole idea.
Alessia's Ristorante Italiano=Alessia's is the biggest disappointment I have found on Yelp. After seeing all the great reviews, I had been wanting to try this place for some time. With so many 5 star reviews and a number of people on here raving about the freshness and quality of the food, I had high hopes. Unfortunately Alessia's didn't live up to the hype. The service was very slow, which I won't hold against them. Most people were sipping wine, so maybe it's their intention to slow it down a bit. The bread is garbage. Probably the worst part of my night there. It tasted like they went across the street to Basha's and bought some rolls that they heated up in the microwave. A good Italian restaurant has to have good bread. The rest of our meal didn't get much better. The pasta we ordered was disappointing. Small portions, small taste, big cost. Definitely not worth the price we paid or the time we waited. The reviews I read did not describe the food I ate. I understand if you love Alessia's for the atmosphere, the wine or maybe because it's hard to find a place like this in Mesa, but the food I ate did not deserve 4.5 stars. It was bad enough that I have no intention of giving Alessia's a second chance. Not the worst I've ever had, just the most disappointing. One last gripe I have is the service. The bad jokes and cheesy Italian don't fit with everything else this place is trying to do. The guy did know his stuff, but he was slow and made me feel awkward more than I'd expect.I am blown away by this little diamond in the rough! This quaint little restaurant is tucked back in the corner of a strip mall in Mesa. I have heard a lot of whispers about this place and had to check it out myself! Absolutely amazing! The restaurants atmosphere is so peaceful and relaxing you can't help but enjoy yourself as soon as you walk through the lit court yard into the front door greeted by smiling faces. The staff is very friendly and the owners actually work here. It's owned by a husband and wife, the wife is the chef and the husband runs the front. Very promising future for this little restaurant, as for the owners love what they do and work very hard at making their customers happy. They are very caring and personable with each customer; you don't see this kind of attention in businesses now a days! They have a great menu; our food was fresh, authentic, mouth watering.... Great selection of wines....... make sure to leave room for dessert! Definitely left with my big ol food baby!! John and Shari expect to see us back very soon! Thank you for such a wonderful evening!My husband and I live close by and decided to try Alessia's. When we walked in we were greeted by the bartender who said the hostess would be right back. We waited a few minutes and she never came. I was hugging my husband and this waiter decided to come up behind me and say hello as if he were going to seat us. I immediately let go of my husband only to find that he was just saying hi. The hostess still was not there so after a minute the waiter seated us and told us to sit where ever we wanted. So what was the point of waiting at all??? Anyways...We browsed the menu and noting really seemed that appetizing to me. My husband asked the waiter how big the portions are for the fettuccine alfredo. The waiter looked at my husband like he was an idiot for asking such a question and said, " I don't know, like average?  Does that make sense?" My husband was pissed, but blew it off as to not ruin the evening. We ordered the fettuccine alfredo to split which came with a salad. The salad was good, but the alfredo tasted like EASY MAC! I would have sent it back, but I didn't want to make my husband feel bad because he chose the restaurant and I was hungry. The alfredo wasn't enough food, so we decided to order calamari from our SECOND waiter. Yes, they have multiple waiters as if they are TRYING to be a FIVE star restaurant, which they are not even close. Then our FIRST waiter came back to ask us if we wanted dessert, when we had just ordered something. I just think it is unorganized and confusing to have five different waiters. I felt like no one knew what was going on and that we kept getting interrupted. Normally at Italian restaurants the calamari is fried, but not here. They set it in front of us and I was horrified. I did not want a nasty rubbery ring tomato soup. We sent it back and decided to just forget ordering anything else. We received our bill and noticed there was a $4 charge for "splitting" the EASY MAC. This place is such a rip off. We paid $18 for a two small bowls of EASY MAC. We did not see on the menu that there was a charge for splitting meals because if we had we would have not split a meal. I will never in my life come back to this place ever again!
Schlotzsky's=What is up with people who like Schlotzky's Deli? My family thinks it's good. That when you put their pizza or sandwich in your mouth, the experience is enjoyable. They are wrong. It's as far from enjoyable as I am from traditional. And even though they are wrong, it's all fine and good... except for those rare occasions when I don't have the choice about whether I am also forced to eat there, like birthdays. I don't want to throw my mom under the bus, because I can't even fathom what this says about her to the unknowing reader, but for her last b-day she wanted Schlotzsky's. I know. I know. It's just so bad. What do you like? The sandwichs? That ridiculous bread? 30,000 cucumber slices? The pizza is so banal I can't even comprehend... Everyone likes artichoke hearts but it can't just be that on a veggie pizza. You must also include flavor. But people like it! I do not get it on any level. I want to... I just don't. I actively dislike writing bad reviews.
Charleston's=Charleston's is really close to my house and been wanting to try this place. Very curious. Very none assuming place. We walked in tonight and there was a 25 minute wait. Argh. Small waiting area and noticed that there were a lot of elderly people. Noticed that there is a bar area and a dining area. Very dark and lots of bricks. My daughter described this place as a wine cellar. Hahaha sounds just about right. So I ordered the Catfish platter and it came with two large pieces of breaded fish, cole slaw, and shoe string french fries. The catfish was cooked perfect. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Loved the fish. Really liked the cole slaw. Enjoyed it and wished they gave me more but it was very good. Fries were normal. Nice, fresh, and crispy. So overall a very good meal. My wife had the Spinach and Chicken Waldorf salad and switched out the cheese for grapes. I can't remember what was inside of the salad. I think it had strawberries, raisins, and apples with spicy pecans with a vignette dressing. The salad had a nice little kick to it. I grabbed a few bites and it was really good. My wife enjoyed itMy kids split a whole rack of baby back ribs. I got one of the ribs and it was falling off the bone. Very good ribs. Had a tiny kick to it but really good. The ribs came with two sides and they got mashed potatoes and shoe string potatoes. They ordered it with beans so the kitchen made a mistake. The waitress gladly gave them their beans. They said the mash wasn't very good but they liked the fries and beans. They were dipping the fries in the beans. So they really enjoyed their baby back ribs. For dessert, we shared a key lime pie with fresh whip cream. So good. Loved the crust. I would have to say the service was extremely good. We got our water cups really quickly and took our order. The food came out pretty quickly and our server kept on filling our water cups. She was very friendly and seemed to always have a smile which is always good. So we had a very enjoyable dinner here. Good food. Good service in a wine cellar ambience. So we'll probably be back. JD and Joyce W was there at the same time but we missed you. Next time. Enjoy and happy dining.
Joe's New York Pizza=I can see why people eat at Joe's late night - I'll have to remember to do that next late night I'm out and craving pizza... Joe's reminds me of a place I used to go for late night slices when I was in college.  (Go Blue by the way and if anyone reading this remembers that awesome late night pizza place in Ann Arbor, please let me know).OK, back to reality and fast forward 12 years... I went to Joe's for lunch today.  I had their chopped salad and my dining companion had a slice.  I was kind of wishing I had a slice too, but I have to admit that the salad was pretty good!  It had lettuce, tomato, salami, and swiss cheese and a balsamic dressing on the side.  I would totally get it again.  Quick, cheap, friendly, and satisfying - how can you say no to that?!I'll be back to Joe's for sure!Found the joint on Yelp and stopped in for some lunch.  I was hungry, so I ordered:2 Slices of Cheese Pizzahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=DLRrNqxUOi4C-ZruqGljlA1 Slice of Tomato Basil Pizzahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=DK3o6jLbbW2Ot3ZSAxZ7lQIt's touted as a New York Style Pizza joint and it is....the Pizza is thin crust and you must fold to eat!  Otherwise the Pizza bends down....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ?select=obcx6HaVezeOz9Duw6_sTwI thought the Cheese Pizza slices were a solid 4 Stars.  They had a nice flavor to them and weren't greasy at all.  However, the Tomato Basil Pizza was not good....2 Stars at best.  The Tomatoes didn't have much flavor and tasted a little "off".....was not happy with that choice.Total damage was around $8 and it included a bottle of Water.  Not bad for 3 Slices.  Next time, I order just Cheese slices.Return Factor - 60%Time for an update and a bump in star rating too...It was my daughter's second birthday and we celebrated our house on a Sunday evening.  I put out appetizers and made a couple of salads, but how can you host approximately 20 people and not serve pizza for a kid's birthday party?!  I used the Eat 24 App and ordered that afternoon.  I love the feature that you can select a later delivery time.  I selected 5pm and ordered the following:-Vegetable Pizza + eggplant (highly recommend adding that eggplant; it was awesome!)-Meat Pizza-Plain Thin Crust 20" Pizza-40 Wings - (Buffalo style with ranch)I was able to add tip to my order when I placed it so I didn't have to worry about tipping the delivery guy.Everything arrived on time and hot... and was demolished by my guests.  I had a slice and more than a few wings as well, and it was worth the calorie splurge for sure!So, bottom line is that Joe's is great for lunch, for delivery, and for late night bites as well.  I'll definitely be back soon!
Harrie's Bagelmania=I miss Jewish delis in LA. Nate and Al's, Brent's Deli, Canter's, etc.This is THE closest thing. I stopped in one morning when I was craving a heavy breakfast. I got the everything bagel with nova and cream cheese. For the first time in my life, I had a choice between Lox and Nova. If you don't know the difference, google it. The Nova and Lox are priced per lb, and its a bit pricey, but who cares. You get what you pay for.I am glad this place is down the street from my office. I'll be back!This place was fantastic, I would have given it 5 stars except for without any notice about a year ago (it has been a while since i last went as i dont frequent vegas much) they changed their cabbage soup recipe. It used to be the BEST cabbage soup i have ever had in my life. It was the reason I went here. It was thick delicious tomato goodness with the best cabbage ever. Now it is the most bland disgusting watered down garbage ever. I have not been here since and do not plan on going back. I actually asked the chef who makes the soup and he said they made him change the recipe for whatever reason and he agreed he liked it better before too. I asked one of the hostess too and they said it was because a customer complained it was too thick or something.I wanted to love Harrie's Bagelmania. I didn't! There is a scarcity of New York style bagel shops in Las Vegas. The only three that I know of are Bagel Cafe (Summerlin), NY Bagels (downtown), and Harrie's Bagelmania.  Harrie's Bagelmania is in an economically challenged neighborhood. I was surprised to see the exorbitant prices that are disproportionate to the average income of the area and the highest prices that I have seen a bagel restaurant charge. Nearly $15 for a bagel with lox Sandwich!? Your kidding Me! Nearly $9 for a bagel with egg salad! This is before paying for a beverage.   I opted for the bagelwich with a fried egg and ham. This is one of the reasonable priced items on their menu. Interestingly the only style of egg listed was fried. What about scrambled?  I wasn't too crazy about the bagelwich. When I taste a bagel, my expectation is that it is hot and soft. This bagelwich fell short of my expectation. The ham was okay. As far as the coffee it was also okay.   I was satisfied with the service. The waitress was on top of my coffee refills at the same that she was pleasant. When I paid the cashier joked over the  change being an unlucky number. I easily rectified that when I left the waitress a tip for good service.   I don't love Harrie's Bagelmania. To be honest I left disappointed with the exorbitant pricing and bagelwich that fell short of my expectations yet satisfied with the service. My Harrie's Bagelmania check-ins stop here.Much like the Bagel Café on the west side of town, Harrie's serves bagels and deli classics in an old-school diner-style setting. Portions are generous and good-quality product results in surprisingly high prices: my bagel sandwich with lox set me back an absurd $15. I will say that it was loaded with a lot of lox, but maybe normal portions and prices would be more appealing... Other than that, the bagel itself was underwhelming, toasted to a hardness that was difficult to bite into, and just wasn't particularly flavorful aside from the toppings.Bagels are available in individually or in bulk, toasted or not, with or without schmear and other toppings. Shop only offers choices of regular or scallion cream cheese. Potato pancakes, knishes, blintezes, and other Jewish deli staples available as well as meats by the pound. I still prefer BC, but this isn't a bad option if you're on this side of town.
Kohinoor Cuisine of India=GROUPON SCAM PLEASE READ:UPDATE 11/9/2013 YELP deleted my photo of the container of chicken tikka masala next to a can of coke. The picture shows the size of the container, smaller than the size of a coke. This was my order, my experience so YELP is being an ass to remove my photo.On to the review:This place was a total SHAM. We bought the $25 for $12 take out Groupon. We showed up and asked for a menu (no menu from Kohinoor online, not even on their Facebook. SCAM) , they said they had no menu, WHAT? After asking a couple times the owner said to someone else "get the menu" and cocked his head. They managed to come up with a ridiculously priced menu after being there for 10 minutes. $12.99 for chicken tikka masala with no rice or naan. The Biltmore doesn't even charge these prices.We are a regular of Curry Corner literally a stones throw away and the owner starts talking crap about Curry Corner. At CC you get the tikka masala, rice AND add garlic naan for $10. Anyway you don't eat chicken tikka masala without rice or naan (and no other restaurant we have ever been to HASN'T offered it) so my husband ordered this for me (it came to $20 here!!!!!) and his Lamb Biryani ($12.99). When the food comes and the owner shows my husband the food my husband is shocked SHOCKED he is charging $12.99 for what CC charges $8, then the owner tells my husband that CC sells a smaller size, that my husband could go to CC right now if he didn't believe him. WHAT!!!! We eat there once a week! I get the same thing @ CC and we would know what size they give us!My husband is Arab and is talking to the owner who is totally swindling my husband. He gives my husband a small mango yogurt drink and then he goes on to tell us that if we stop going to CC and go to his restaurant that he would sell us the buffet for $8.99 and our kids would eat free (they are 26 months and 9 months).  Then he takes my husband next door to the store to show him the halal meat (is this when they put the buffet food in the take out containers or take the buffet food to the back and make chicken tikka masala and biryani out of the buffet spread? No proof but I wouldn't doubt this).So my husband said ok, he paid for our food difference $8 and left.When we got home, his biryani was BEEF not lamb. There was no mix up, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and my husband was talking to the owner the entire time.This was a HORRIBLE Groupon experience, and a total scam, offering a take out Groupon for $12 for $25 worth of food and then offering ridiculous prices and claiming they don't have a menu.BY THE WAY they have a lunch buffet for $6.99 and dinner for $9.99 WITH CTM, samosas, rice, naan etc, so prey tell me how they are selling chicken tikka masala TO GO for $12.99 with no rice or naan?My husband threw out his biryani the beef was inedible (chewy and old, the dish was room temperature) and then he ended up eating leftover bbq pulled chicken sandwich that I made yesterday. I took pictures of my CTM and the container is smaller than the size of a can of coke. CTM was room temperature (it should have been HOT) edible, not good, but not bad  but I wouldn't go back if it was even $5.In the real world we pretty much got $10 worth of food (inedible BEEF biryani) and we paid $20.
Little Caesars Pizza=1 Star for this Rainbow/Tropicana location. Service was horrible...the cashier was slamming the cashier drawer as if she was pissed off at the world and had a permanent frown on her face as if she were smelling burning hair from her upper lip! Waited 18 minutes on a Tuesday at 3pm for 1 lousy pepp/sausage pizza. We ordered 2 orders of crazy bread, one bag was burned, looking more like the color of pretzels, you know crazy bread should not be that color! Why the moron that baked that bad batch had the nerve to bag it up is beyond me. I got home and called to speak with a store "Supervisor" spoke with Cody who says "Yeah our oven is retarded and makes a lot of bad batches of our crazy bread, it is hit and miss" I will replace your next order at no charge. Um ok... and had no response regarding the bad service from his coworker as stated he was not there, he just got on shift at 4pm.Calling Cody and complaining was useless, he just rushed me off the phone and was clear he did not give a flying puck! This location is the only one in the las vegas valley I have to always sit and wait forever for a freaking pizza. Also the only location with employess who have the personality of Prisoner's waiting their turn in death row. I am not a fan of their cheap, bland and flavorless pizza in the first place, I only come here at the request of my baby sister (26) who happens to like their pizza, ugh. Next time I will put my foot down and say hell no to "LITTLE SKEEZERS" I am through with this location...done done done, enough said! To the crew at this location, you can all go to hell, you all have a bad attitude every single time! Yes, it is clear you hate your job, don't make me suffer for your employment decisions!Bite Me!
Lon's At the Hermosa=My fiancee and I visited Lon's at the Hermosa on a Friday night in June to celebrate our anniversary and was a perfect location for a little romance under the calm, star-cloaked Arizona sky in a pocket of wilderness within the sprawling Phoenix metro. Lon's provided one of the most inspired meals I've had in quite a while, beginning expeditiously with a world-class wine list, representative of various renowned grape-squeezing regions as the Pacific Coast, Italy, France, Argentina, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand.  After a quick consult with a very capable sommelier who spirited us with an impressive explanation of Portuguese reds, we agreed on a bottle on Golfo [?], which may or may not be the correct name, as it smartly inoculated us after two and a half glasses each.  Mmm!In place of a starter, we ordered two unique salads: Mine was a seared duck salad on baby greens with toasted pine nuts an a white vinaigrette.  It was ingenious ... but not quite as ingenious as the scallop salad my fiancee had.  They were absolutely the best-prepared scallops either of us had ever experienced.What is even more amazing is that the salads were surpassed in flavor by the entrees, which sometimes flops as a headliner to gourmet starters.  Not the case here.  My sun dried tomato crusted rack of lamb was prepared excellently and the crust paired with the tender, juicy lamb chops (4) was easily skyrocketed into the top 3 list of things I've ever tasted.  The goat cheese herb grits were a perfect, and light compliment .. and something I've truly never seen on a menu before, much less experienced by taste.  My fiancee's grilled filet of salmon with blackberry barbeque glaze was very much an original as well.  Even for someone who is not a gigantic fan of salmon, such as myself, really enjoyed the complexity of flavors.  She very much enjoyed it.For dessert, we had the sorbet sampler as a means of cooling off from our frenetic eating/drinking pace.  Although very delicious, it was a mistake on my part as there was a sampler of tiramasu/creme brulee/pote de chocolate.  Ugh.  What was I thinking bypassing this delicious plate of hyperglycemia?  Well, there's always next time.It also must be noted, the stellar service we received.  The server was absolutely charming, gracious, and accommodative, referring to us by name, refilling our water/wine glasses, and supervising small touches like fetching the sommelier and informing the pastry chef that it was our anniversary [with that information, they gave us a chocolate script 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate - nice touch].Overall, it was a place worthy of a very special occasion, and one which I would not hesitate to return to so that we can experience the rest of their impressive menu.Restaurant Week makes writing reviews complicated. Restaurants lower their prices during this 7-day period (a three-course meal runs you $29 per person) in order to gain new customers and fill spots during less-popular dining times. At places like Lon's or Cowboy Ciao, guests end up getting meals that would normally cost $50 or more per person for a mere $29. Knowing that I got a much-more expensive meal at a bit of a discount definitely makes me want to give Lon's a higher rating. At the same time, however, my husband and I were discussing that we would have been disappointed with our experience *had we paid* twice the price. And since people reading this review may not have the good fortune of going to Lon's during the RW, when prices are lower than normal, I'm going to have to give the restaurant 3 stars. This is based on the food not being that flavorful or impressive given the prices they normally charge. We started the meal with Absolut martinis, which were pricey at $12 each and contained vermouth even though we asked for them "dry." Since we, just like Joel L, thought that spare ribs was a strange starter but both wanted to try them, we decided to pick a starter off the regular menu. We both love duck, so we ordered the salad with the seared duck. It wasn't great. We liked that it had pine nuts but found the dressing to be overwhelming acidic and were disappointed by the four pepperoni-shaped, paper-thin, and bland-tasting duck pieces. The disappointment continued with the spare ribs. I loved the sweet potato puree that accompanied them but found the ribs themselves to be a bit dry and not all that flavorful. The "carrot jus" was not detectable (or if it was, didn't add much), and we were dismayed to see that the listing for the same ribs on the regular menu said that the meat came with "ancho chile chocolate sauce." How sad that the RW version of the ribs didn't have the opportunity to be dressed up in a more flavorful sauce!For my entree, I ordered the pan-roasted scallops with the roasted pepper spaetzle, organic spinach, and the corn jus. My husband doesn't care for scallops much, but I found them to be well-cooked and not too metallic or gritty (as bad scallops can be). The sides, especially the spaetzle, were interesting and pretty flavorful. I could definitely taste that the spinach was organic. I also had a glass of wine with my entree and did appreciate the pairings listed on the RW menu next to each course, which made it easy to quickly choose an appropriate wine.  My husband had the open-faced shrimp ravioli. We both loved the concept and again, found the vegetables to be really fresh and tender. However, we didn't taste anything resembling lobster jus and found the shrimp to be pretty over-cooked. The portion was small, which we usually don't mind if the dish is high-end and super-flavorful, but that wasn't really the case here. In terms of desserts, the lemon tarte was just ok (and actually reminded me of those lemon bars you make from a boxed mix), but the chocolate truffle torte with the minted berries was outstanding. Since we weren't blown away by any of the other dishes we had tried, it was really nice to end the meal with a delicious, rich dessert. I am glad to have had a romantic meal in a beautiful patio setting for only $29 per person, but again, we would have been quite disappointed with Lon's food had we gone and paid regular prices for everything ($25+ for the shrimp ravioli would have been the most disappointing).  That being said, I can't reiterate how peaceful and unique the patio setting is, and the service was certainly professional and attentive (the bus boys did an especially nice job of keeping the table clean and re-filling water glasses). The atmosphere and service may make me want to go back at some point (maybe on someone else's dime!) and give Lon's food another try. One final note - Lon's does take reservations through OpenTable.com although the email confirmation requested that we call the restaurant directly in order to secure patio seating, so I would suggest making direct contact with the restaurant if it really matters to you to sit on the patio.This place is Fn amazing. The boy took me here for my birthday dinner, and literally, I cannot think of any other place I would have rather been at. We went late, 9pm rez, It was an amazing evening so we sat outside near the fireplace. You seriously have to sit outside, it's almost like you're in another state on vacation with how secluded it is. Each table gets its own heat lamp too, by the way. We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool. Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude. We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing. The mussels were delicious.. I LOVE mussels, and ever since I left Boston, I haven't had any good ones.. these were awesome. I wanted more. The Foie Gras was obviously delicious..  Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds. For our entrees, I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin. For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus. I'm not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates. We devoured everything, and all of it was perfect. Especially the bottle of wine we split with it.To wrap up the meal, we got the crème brulee to share, and as my photo shows, they personalized it for my special day. That along with 2 glasses of port, and we were good to go.. Staff don't mess around, they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet. I will say this place is not cheap, and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions, however, I will absolutely go back again and again and again, birthday or not. Seriously one of the most delicious dinners ive ever had, period.Sushi grade Ahi served on a 500 degree block of Himalayan sea salt.A lone short rib, cubed, perched atop a bed of braised root vegetables. So majestic looking, it reminded me of a sentinel on lookout.A hangar steak (flank) cooked to perfection.All three shared two common themes:Both the presentation and sodium levels were immeasurable.I love Lon's. I want to show them off to my friends from out of town. I love their wine cellar...it's dungeon-esque type features.I want to eat there on special occasions because I know I won't be disappointed.But this trip had me rethinking everything I know about Lon's and that's saying something since I've been going there for many years now.The gravy on the hangar steak was inedible it was so salty. My girls secretly wiped it all away so as not to create a stir with our server, knowing I would send it all back and give him a couple of what-fers in the process.My short rib was braised perfectly, however, it was dry and lean. Not what I was hoping for.And the pre-dinner bread basket had the most delicious looking chips, also inedible due to the extreme salt content.Stay out of the bar.I ordered a Crown Royal Manhattan.I was informed they don't serve Crown Royal, but some bullshit well whiskey called Buffalo Trace. Seriously, who doesn't serve Crown? I expected Lon's to serve Crown Black for Christ's sakes.My wife ordered a Mai Tai. It was undrinkable.Lon's, here's some advice from the cheap seats.Stop believing your own press clippings and take a long hard look in the mirror.At the very least, hire an executive chef whose cravings for salt doesn't rival a 14th century sailor sporting a goiter the size of a basketball.I've never actually eaten here so I'm not sure how amazing the food is and I will not be finding out any time soon. Here is my experience...I walked into the restaurant for dinner and there was no one in sight. The maitre dee asked my name for a reservation and i stated I was a walk in. He said...let me see what I have but you may be sitting in a room by yourself. He proceeded to say, "let me see to these guests and then I'll try to seat you!"  An older couple was still outside walking up that he felt where a priority over finding me and my guest a table. As I was standing in the doorway completely embarrassed in front if my guest and thinking about how demeaning the person was I walked out and decided not to eat here. This place may have amazing food and amazing cocktails but I was not able to get past the service.  I will not be going back nor would I ever recommend someone subjecting themselves to that kind of treatment.My boyfriend and I came here for a special occasion. He had gotten a promotion at his new job within 3 weeks of working there..Amazing right?! Oh, Which he had no idea where i was taking him, nor had a surprise for him.. We got lost on the way there. Because of the the constructions. I was sooo lost, thinking this hotel should not be in a neighborhood area, haha but it was.  Just keep driving.  :)We had the three course meal. Everything was a la carte. I had the Hermosa salad. I love the fruity sauce that was in the salad. also the mash potato was very creamy and boy do I want some more. Boyfriend had steak, or did he had pork? I forgot.. he absolutely loved it.The dessert came out, I had called in advance and specifically told them to keep the dessert part a surprise. They did a wonderful job. They even came out with a congratulation card, and the staff signed it. So personal, yet what a kind gesture that was.I'll be back here again. Thank you Hermosa staff!!MEN: READ MORE FOR AN EASY DATE IDEA! My boyfriend surprised me with a simple Happy Hour date night here the other night. He came home, pulled me away from my computer and insisted that we head straight to a surprise location. His goal was to watch the sunset but unfortunately their gorgeous patio was pretty secluded and we couldn't really see it. However, I must say that it was still the most romantic date spot!! It was literally a sanctuary. They had relaxing live music that started at 6 PM (you may want to call first to confirm if they will have it on the night that you decide to go), fire pits everywhere, candles, white lights strung throughout, $6 drink specials and $4 bar snacks with other delicious appetizers (Their chips, salsa, and guac were heavenly!). An appetizer trio that comes on a pretty dish was $15. Beyond the drinks and apps, this place is sure to send your significant other's heart wild. When we left, I felt like I had just relaxed all day at the Spa! Here are their daily specials!: http://hermosainn.com/lons/last-drop-bar/events/happy-hour.shtml
Golden Dragon Chinese Cuisine=It was a rainy day in Vegas. It was the type of weather that made everything dark & gloomy and all you want to do is stay inside and watch a movie and eat... I came in here to grab some Chinese take-out and headed home before it started pouring.There wasn't too much excitement going on in the dining section, but it was a little crowded in their waiting area. The chairs were placed so close together that it can be a little awkward when waiting for your food to be ready.I ordered the egg fried rice and the beef with broccoli. There isn't really anything spectacular about this place. I guess the portions they give out for a lower price than some other take-out places in the area are what makes the trip here worth it. It's pretty much what you would expect from a Chinese take-out place. I would come again because it has great prices for the amount of food they give you.
Goldilocks=Dear Goldilocks,I waited to get a yummy drink JUST because I knew we were headed here after our breakfast at the Chowking down the street. Apparently you folks are not so consistent from location to location. Being from Cali and privileged to have tried your Avocado shake... I was super eager to have one in Vegas. Of course the people @ the counter thought I was crazy. Whatever! I guess the only thing going for this location is the all you can eat breakfast for about 5bux that was posted on the door. Please make the appropriate changes with what you read from me & other Yelpers!Respectfully, Kriss P.2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #10Our Halo-Halo Challenge stops at 10 locations, with Goldilocks as our last contender.  We decided early that Goldilocks would be last because they have been around for quite some time with 21 locations in the US, it was recommended by others, and we remember that their Halo-Halo was pretty good.  In other words, we wanted to save the best for last.  What we found was some inconsistencies to how I remember Goldilocks' Halo-Halo to be.  Cost for their Halo-Halo is $4.99. Ingredients included kaong, pinipig, nata de coco, macapuno, red beans, ube ice cream, lanka, condensed milk, and shave ice all mixed together.  Missing was real ube and flan.  Halo-Halo means "Mix-Mix" and that's what you do to eat this treat.  You start with this pretty dessert and you mix it.  But what I found at Goldilocks is that they tend to mix mix what they put in their Halo-Halo.  I've had Halo-Halo from Goldilocks from locations ranging from their Philippines, NorCal, SoCal, and now Vegas.  I swear flan and even legit ube was in their "Mix-Mix". I guess all locations are different, which left me disappointed when I didn't get what I wanted in their Halo-Halo. Overall, I still finished my Halo-Halo but would not consider theirs as my favorite.  Sorry Goldilocks, but you need flan and ube in your Halo-Halo to make me happy. Like some of the other Halo-Halo contenders, food was also taste tested.  I wanted their chicken BBQ on a stick because the pictures on the menu looked so delicious. But they were out and this wasn't the first time this happened to me.  I ended up with their half chicken BBQ with garlic fried rice.  Just a note, folks...rice is not included with their meals.  You have to order rice separate. So, don't assume you're getting it and they don't ask you either. My meal still hit the spot. My Halo-Halo was just okay, but at last their chicken BBQ was good.  PS:  We committed to ending this challenge at 10 locations. We know there's more out there (ie, Nanay Gloria's, Red Ribbon, DT's, etc).  Maybe part 2 of this challenge is in the future, maybe not.  One things for sure, we're both ready to get back to eating clean and training mean.  This Halo-Halo Challenge was a great way for me to decompress from all that damn grilled chicken breast.  2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WAContender #8 (Fiesta Filipina):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-filipina-cuisine-henderson#hrid:VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHwContender #9 (Ito'y Sariling Atin):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/itoy-sariling-atin-las-vegas#hrid:X3FQeLTQycMELQ66wgpvIQThis is for the bakery and the restaurant. Our family had lunch here for the second time, we were running errands and we got hungry and we felt like Filipino food. I wouldn't crave for their food and go out of my way just to eat here. Everything was ok, siomai was ok, the sisig was cut too big, I like my sisig in tiny little pieces and crunchier. The fried was good, I would order that again if we are ever caught hungry and in the area. I would also order the dinuguan again but that's because I always have to have that when we eat at a Filipino restaurant. I like the sauce all over my rice (no dinuguan meat for me) and since I refuse to learn how to cook this specific dish (I refuse to touch the blood, even though I deal with blood on a daily basis. Don't ask!), I make sure to order when the opportunity is there . Now for the bakery, this is the reason why I give them 4 stars, otherwise it would be 3. Their pandesal is soft and creamy and their sans rival is the best I've ever had. It's my son's favorite, I've tried other places and we always end coming back at Goldilocks for this once or twice a year treat. Also make sure to try their mocha roll, they are known for this cake! To wrap up this review, if you're hungry and want Filipino food, there's a cheaper restaurant across the street by Smiths called Sariling Atin. Then when you're ready for your dessert, head to the Goldilocks bakery.Pinoy baked goods galore! Inside, Goldilocks doubles as a bakery and restaurant (half of the room is the bakery section, while the other half is the dining area) that offers traditional Filipino dishes and pastries. The aroma of freshly baked bread and Filipino cuisine envelopes you once you step in, which is pretty inviting.In general, Filipino pastries tend to be sweet and filling so picking up a few things was enough to satisfy my midday sweet tooth. I feel like they didn't have a huge selection of goods to choose from, but the staples to any Filipino bakery are there including: ensaymada, mamon, cuchinta, etc. I ended up getting the baked cheese rolls and the ensaymada with ube (a brioche roll with a sweet, purple yam filling). The cheese rolls were the same texture as a traditional pan de sal roll (with fine bread crumbs lightly sprinkled on top), but this baked good was sweeter in flavor. The ensaymada with ube had the sweet, yet buttery taste.One thing I like about these specific pastries is the fact that the cheese incorporated in them compliments the sweetness; it doesn't have an overbearing "cheesy" taste -- it's more subtle and may be unnoticed because of the pastry's sweetness.I was pretty satisfied with the goods that I bought because they were soft and filling. It's what I expect out of a perfectly baked Filipino pastry.
Del Taco=The best DT location in town! Old school locals know what this building used to be and we welcomed DT when it took over and decided to make its presence known (incorporating menu items from the previous business) in Vegas years ago. Yes the location is smaller but the building is older. They have never messed up my order here and it's always hot and delicious. The manager has been there a long time and gets to know her regular customers. She welcomes you like family no matter if you come inside or use the drive thru. It's crazy that a fast food place can do that but that's what I've experienced for many years at this location. On taco nights the drive thru can get backed up but it goes by quick so don't hesitate to stop if it looks long.
Dillon's Thunderbird=This is a meat place close to Sun City so dinner at 5 last night was quite appropriate. Dillon's is decent fresh food in a casual environment. Good for groups, efficient wait staff and big portions. The man was on a brisket kick and since this was a BBQ joint, figured he would try it. It is Kansas style and it was nice and tender BBQ-though not quite "smoked" and definitely sliced on a meat slicer.The daughter had a pulled pork sandwich that was tender and delicious. The Grandmother had a brisket sandwich, there are other offerings as well-fried chicken, chicken fried steak, fish, etc. Salads are good as are the onion rings they ordered for appetizers. This is no BBQ joint. This is a family restaurant with decent food and decent service.I am giving 4 stars again mostly due to the great service we have. For some reason, AZ is still ass backwards when it comes to recognizing waitstaff. They are not paid minimum wage (though I am not sure how this is legal). They make about $3.25 per hour from the establishment (this is up from $2.12 two years ago) and the rest is supposed to come out of tips. Any young person willing to work in the Sun City area and depend on tips and actually works really hard to get them deserves a whole star to themselves (oh and an extra tip behind the chintzy tippers in my family here).Reservations are only taken for a party of 8 or more.This place has been on my to try list since before I knew what Yelp is.  I made it my choice when I won a football bet last fall.  Yes, I know football season has been over for a while but diets, cash flow and life in general, on both sides, made this dinner wait.  Suffice it to say the company was worth the wait.When we got there about 6:30 on Saturday the parking lot was packed and we were worried we would be stuck in the bar with our growling stomachs.  It turned out we were seated immediately although there were only a few tables open.We started with a half order of onion rings.  These are hand made in house and served with a really good dipping sauce.  Both the rings and the sauce reminded me of Lenny's (which got rid of their sauce and started buying frozen onion rings) only one notch higher.  We were both thinking ribs in a BBQ joint and she got the baby backs and I got the St Louis style spare ribs.  She got the fall off the bone she wanted and I got the slightly chewy I wanted.  Of the sauces I preferred the cajun which was only mildly hot, however the ribs were good enough they really didn't need much sauce.  We both ordered different sides so we could try many of them.  We liked them all but my favorites were the cole slaw and the macaroni and cheese.  The only soso item was the dinner roll but even there they are smart enough to serve soft butter.The service was attentive without being obtrusive the entire time.  Our waitress had the answers to all of our questions without having to go ask.Sort of an anomaly in the North West valley, you can arrive here between 7:30 and 8:30 and the place will be sort of quiet between the Sun City folks and the later night crowd and be seated right away.
The Golden Greek=Golden Greek is a diamond in the rough and I find myself craving it often.The place is one of my favorites, if not my top Greek restaurant in the valley.All of the food is made from scratch and absolutely delicious. I think I've liked pretty much every single food item that I've tried there, the hummus & pitas, the greek salad, the spankopita, the pasta de greco. Love all of it.The service can be slow at times, but the fantastic food is definitely worth the wait. Prices are low, so the meals are easy on your wallet. If you want some spectacular Greek food, this is the spot for you.Earlier in the week one of my customers from Wickenburg mentioned he had just come from lunch here and when he lived in town it was a regular stop for him.  So I Yelped it while he was here and found not a single bad review.After a disappointing time at the MVD I needed to treat myself to something good.Ambiance - OK so this is not a place to impress a date.  It's a bit, OK a big bit, dated.  But it is really clean.  A total of 11 tables and 3 of those could be moved and joined for a party of 10-12.  Most of the customers were regulars for a Friday lunch and 5 tables were in use.  The waitress (owner?) doesn't smile much but she is pleasant.Service - After being asked my party size I was told to pick a table.  As soon as she had finished serving another table she brought over my service and a menu.  She gave me a couple of minutes and then came and took my order.  When my iced tea was running low she appeared at my table with a pitcher.  There is a quiet relaxed feeling to the whole place and if you go with that vibe you will find the service to be quite good and actually faster than it feels when checked with a watch afterward.Food - This is the fourth star!  I had Chicken Apollo, chicken breast with sauteed spinach, feta cheese on fresh baked bread.  The bread as listed is pita but it is something different and better.  It came with a "small" Greek salad that took up a good portion of the dinner plate with basic iceberg, large chunks of tomato and cucumber and a couple of Greek olives topped with feta cheese and an oil/vinegar dressing. With iced tea and tax the bill was $8.93.Definitely a place to put on the list for more visits to try other menu items.I love family owned establishments. I just ate here for the first time. It was great!! By far the best Mediterranean food I've had in Phoenix. The quality of the service and food was excellent. The food was presented well, very tasty and enough portion size to leave me walking away stuffed. I was joined by my wife Carol, my 22 year old grandson Michael and our friend Kathy R.Kathy R. had eaten here before. In fact she has been coming here for years. She said at one time or another she has tried everything on the menu and just loves their food. Today she ordered the Moussaka. Which she aid was toasty, & creamy. (Basically Moussaka is a lasagna without the noodles, the eggplant in it  adds the right amount of bitterness to balance out the great, intense flavor of the sauce.)Although I didn't try a bite it looked great. Michael got cheese raviolis and an antipasto salad. He didn't say much about either dish but they looked good to me. My wife & I got the Pork Souvlaki (Tender chunks of pork served over rice). My wife ate her plate clean which she rarely does so I know she liked her meal. She told me when we got home she wants to go back there so that told me she really enjoyed the food.Like I said for my dinner entrée I ordered the Pork Souvlaki . But before I did I  ordered a Greek Salad as a starter. It was much bigger than I expected for a side salad. The salad was very fresh. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were extremely tasty. I didn't know my entrée came with either a Greek salad or  Agolemono soup. Since I had already ordered and eaten a Greek salad I opted  for the Augolemono Soup (chicken stock, egg lemon soup) my soup was absolutely  outstanding!!!! All meals  also come with a vegetable of  the day and homemade pita bread. You could tell the pita bread was homemade. It tasted fresh and came out hot. OMG it was delicious.I almost forgot with dinner Kathy R. wanted us to try the spaghetti with meat sauce so we could see what it was like. It was a small side dish. Kathy raved about it so I thought why not try it. My wife said she liked it and would order it. I thought it was just OK then again I grew up in Rhode Island in a very Italian neighborhood so it may have been good for a Greek restaurant but not to my taste. Back in Rhode Island the Italians and Greeks cooked many similar dishes including pasta dishes.FOOD: All of the food was great. The food was so good! I would definitely come back for more in the future.PRICE: . SERVICE:   "staff" consisted of  a mother-sister-brother team.  The mom wasn't there today. The brother sat us and brought us menus. He was very friendly. The sister was our waitress and server, she was attentive and friendly.  AMBIANCE:  A cute little family owned restaurant tucked in a small strip mall. The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely. It does look like it has been there for many years but the place is NOT as Nadia C, said "Dumpy". CONCLUSION:  We were seated immediately. Food was excellent, service was spot-on. My recommendation: if you want authentic, come here for an outstanding dining experience!!! This is a very special neighborhood ethnic restaurant.TURN FACTOR: 100%
House of Tricks=I feel like I'm being extremely generous with this one.  Luckily for HOT, I had great company which made my overall rating higher than they might deserve.  3.7 stars total - based on the following...AMBIANCE - 5 starsIn a historic house with both indoor and outdoor seating, this is an amazing atmosphere; better than most of the strip malls that the valley is known for!SERVICE - 4 starsThe hostess went above and beyond by moving us from an inside table to an outside table by the fire when we had a change of heart and wanted some fresh air.  They also went above and beyond to help me find a parking spot as I didn't want my car to get towed from the lot next door like Patti B. yelped about previously.  Larissa was our server and she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  There was only one thing that was a bit disappointing when it came to service:  that she came by to take our order and I told her I needed a minute and she said she'd be right back but disappeared for around 10 or 15 minutes.FOOD - 2.5 starsLet me explain:  I chose wrong.  Do not order the Seafood Pistou.  Larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, I ordered it anyways.  It was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  The seafood didn't taste so fresh and I think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  However, Kristin C. chose right - she had the Ahi Tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to Kristin, it was fantastic!  Note to self:  order Ahi if I ever return!  Oh, and I tasted the Asian Pear Salad too - it was tasty.  So, the 2.5 star rating is an average... COMPANY - 5 stars!I'm going to allow the fact that I had a really fun dining companion bring up the average a bit here...BANG FOR YOUR BUCK- 2 starsWe had only water and perrier to drink and our bill was still kind of high for what I thought was just an ok meal... essentially 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 Perrier was over $80 out the door!I admit that this review is based on just one experience... however, because of the fact that I have no clue when I'll go back, I wanted to review it anyways!  If you go to HOT, go for the ambiance and order the tuna! :)SO many reviews already I'll try to keep it short and Sweet!Food~ I've only been for lunch, is Always Delicious, price, quality and quantity wise.Some of my favorites include Quiche of the day served with salad and fresh fruit, The Grilled Salmon and the Chicken Shawarma Salad (see pics) The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all. Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar. I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.Ambiance~ Love it, inside a cute old house or outside on the Lush and maturely landscaped garden patio.*Notes*~Make reservations for lunch or dinner just to be safe~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters~Dinner prices are near triple the lunch prices for the entrees~Ask for a bread and butter basket, chances are you'll be here awhile**parking meters have an 80min. time limit, mention this if you are having SLOW serviceI  have to give 5 stars for the foodVery, very few things in life ever reach perfection. House of Tricks, you are my lunch mecca!Honestly, if I could eat here Monday through Friday for lunch, I would. And what would I order? Their daily quiche. Absolutely. No hesitations. No second thoughts. Their quiche of the day is perfection!I've eaten here twice in a single week. Yes, House of Tricks is simply that awesome. After my 1st visit, I was craving it the very next day. So I made plans to go back that very week. I wanted to try their quiche again. House of Tricks is my absolute favorite lunch spot in Tempe!For $10, you get their quiche of the day, fresh fruit and a soup or salad. First quiche was chicken and goat cheese. Wow... That's all I could think to myself. "Wow, Alicia, this is... wow..." Second trip I had sausage, mushrooms and Gruyere quiche, which I ordered with their daily soup, a lobster squash concoction. While the soup was really, really good, I was still enamored with their quiche. And fresh fruit? C'mon. This is the stuff Lunch Nirvana is made of!House of Tricks, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you! House of Tricks, I love you! I love your quiche! You deserve every single exclamation point in the exclamation point satchel. Seriously!I would eat inside, outside, at the bar, wherever I could. Yes, I'd eat here every single day. That adds up to a $50 weekly habit... but I bet there's not one quiche I wouldn't like!The lovely Sarah G decided to bless me w her awesome presence for lunch this afternoon. I am so glad we decided on this lovely House of Tricks! Does anyone know why its called that?!?! I'm curious please tell me??!?! Soooo this should really be 4.5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow. A lot of places down here in Tempe seem that way to me. For some weird reason or another I feel like I enter the Twilight Zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time. Maybe they teach this course at ASU or maybe everyones just stoned, IDK!?!?! The soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and I dont even like ginger haha!! Sarah took a pic of the salad I had. I had the best salad EVER!!! Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad with Mango, Melon, Strawberries, Oranges, Toasted Pine Nuts, Citrus Cous Cous and Baby Field Greens with Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette. I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT!! Abso-fucking-lutely YUM-GASMIC!! The chef here is a fucking genius and I will never have enough of this place.....EVER! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server's ass to get the tables turned around quicker?? I will surely bring all out of towner's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future. Wine tasting is on Tuesdays I better move closer!! So when are we going?!?!?House of Tricks is a great place for dinner if you're looking to go out for a special occasion. It's not somewhere I'd go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two. I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I don't eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldn't even finish it - but my date didn't hesitate to finish it for me. We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If you're sitting at the tables next to the wall, I'd say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy. Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a 'no sense of urgency' kind of server - but we weren't in too much of a hurry anyway.How do I love thee House of Tricks?  Let me count the ways:1.  The cozy cottage and gorgeous bar area complete with twinkle lights make me forget I am right off of Mill Ave which is a definite plus.2.  There are plenty of delicious options at lunch and dinner for my non-meat eating friends.3.  One of the most underrated wine lists in the Valley at a far lower markup than other restaurants of its caliber in the area.  Example, several years ago before Turley blew up and became a trendy wine, I used to enjoy bottles there for $45!!!  Crazy, I know...4.  Their food is fresh and divine.  Their dinner menu changes seasonally and their creative chef always offers very inventive specials that you wish would be put permanently on the menu.  Some of my favorites are the Ahi tuna and the oh so tender Petite Filet Mignon.5.  They recently added a Happy Hour!!!!  (Multiple exclamation points because we all know I like the sauce : )  )6.  House of Tricks became the first restaurant in all of Arizona that my food snob of a mother insists I take her to every time she comes in town to visit.I have to take one star away (well, really only a half a star if I had my way) because their lunch prices are a bit steep and it upsets me that my wallet prohibits me from eating there as often as I'd like.If you've never been there, run don't walk.  It is truly a gem in one of the dullest dining parts of the Valley.I loved the setting. HOT is located on a fairly busy street, but you would never know it sitting on the patio surrounded by trees. Free parking is available at the meters after 6 pm Monday through Saturday. They have a lot of outdoor seating, I actually didn't take a peek inside other than to wash my hands before dinner. The space on the wooden patio outside is cozy (that means that some of tables are pretty close together). We sat right next to the fireplace, but they also have plenty of heat lamps to keep you warm on a chilly night. And the tables are pretty small to keep everything on them (2 water glasses, 2 wine glasses, candle, 2 bread plates, 2 dinner plates, utensils, salt and pepper, flower vase, bread basket, butter). We had to move some stuff to the top edge of the fireplace. We were still pretty stuffed from our heavy lunch so we passed on starters and decided to munch on bread and order dinner. The bread was pretty good, but the lemon poppy butter (it changes every night) was amazing. It was so light, sweet and tangy. We expected to get more of it when we asked for more bread and butter, but they just brought out plain butter. Our waitress said they had only make so much because it changes every night, so you have to ask specifically for it their special butter of the night if you want more. Weird that they were already out since it was maybe 7:30 pm. For dinner I had the ballotine of chicken stuffed with brioche foie gras stuffing (you get 3 pieces), cognac demi glace, sautéed spinach and butternut squash puree. It was heaven. And all went together perfectly. Mike had the beef tenderloin on horseradish whipped potatoes, sautéed spinach, bacon onion jam and red wine demi glace. Although he ordered it medium it came out almost well done. It was kind of hard to immediately tell the donenss when he cut into the steak (other than the texture) because it is pretty dark outside. The wait staff really should have a small flashlight and wait for you to cut into it so you can tell.  However, they quickly apologized for the mistake and promptly brought out a new plate. Mike said the meat wasn't very flavorful. This place can be pretty pricey. For just 2 dinners and 2 glasses of wine, plus tax and tip our bill came out to be just over $90. The atmosphere was nice and the food was good, but I thought it was just a bit overpriced. Heard that lunch is a better deal so I'll have to come back for that.4.5 stars Oh House of Tricks, you are a sneaky devil aren't you? Did you know I was coming? Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars! I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on. Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had! The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit. My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect! I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!Last night was the first time that I ever ate at House of Tricks.  Well, one time I had a piece of a leftover while I was drunk out of my gourd, but that just wasn't the same as actually being there and experiencing the beautiful ambience, having the plate brought to you and getting to pet the fat kitty that lives on the premises.Right now they're got restaurant week going on and for $30 bucks you can get a gnarly three course meal.  I got:  Coconut curry shrimp, Asian meatballs served over a bed of goat cheese and a dulce de leche cheesecake brownie for dessert with a cup of decaf coffee.Unfuckingbelievable.Sometimes when you eat food that is that good, something that soars into that level of greatness, it makes every dish you made that you were oh, so proud of look like a piece of shit.  Did you ever bust your ass and cook something that took all day?  Did you ever make your own turkey stock for gumbo you made and the whole affair took all Sunday and you never even went outside?  I'm sorry, but you're going to be a little depressed after you eat here because it was incredible to an absurd degree.  Dude.  Amazing.House of Tricks was a frequent on my rotation when I worked in this area. I love the ambiance this historic house provides and in a way that makes me forget that I'm in the heart of a college town. House of Tricks slightly reminds me of a restaurant I'd find in Berkley, CA or LA. It's charming, open and has plenty of seating outside. The food here is basic luncheon food such as tasty sandwiches. My favorite go-to sandwich when I visit is the Tuna. The sandwiches are hefty but it's really about the atmosphere when I visit. I will always remember the time I was eating lunch with my sister when the red hat ladies (a group here in Phoenix) walked in and overtook the restaurant. They were so cute in their red hats and they really made me realize that the House of Tricks is your quintessential "ladies who lunch" restaurant to Tempe. I suggest that everyone tries this absolutely charming restaurant for lunch sometime.6/1/11I finally made it to HoT for happy hour!  Parking is in the back- be careful parking anywhere else, as your car might get towed.  There are misters for those who like eating outside.  Since I've only been here once, and I had to eat at the bar area for happy hour, I don't know what the noise level is indoors, but it certainly seems nice in there, if not a bit cramped.  A big minus for me is that smoking is allowed outside, so I'm hoping to secure a table indoors on my next visit.Ordered the only cocktail on the menu that uses ginger liqueur (sorry, but I forgot the name), and really liked it!  It tasted light and refreshing, but packed quite a punch, so be careful-- it went down very smoothly and very fast!  Happy hour knocked off only $1, down to $9, so I suppose it's good that the bartender had a heavy hand.  ;)  As for my entree, I had the Roasted poblano, artichoke, and spinach dip, which came w/ both crostini and water crackers.  Skip the water crackers (they felt stale when I bit into them, and they're very bland) and stick w/ the crispy, nicely-toasted, and olive oil-drizzled crostini.  I did, and I ate the entire thing!  (Well, minus the water crackers.)  The base was very creamy, yet also chunky (I love foods that layer on many textures!), and I really appreciated the heat that the roasted poblanos brought to this dish.  From the moment I took that first bite, I thought that  this dish was different from any other spinach and artichoke dips I've ever tried.  Try it if you're into s/a dips, and let me know what you think of this one!The rest of the menu sounds great, but can get very pricey (salads and soups, $6-10; starters, $10-19; and entrees, $20-32).  Will try to return for lunch!I won a bid at silent auction for a $150 gift certificate to this place.  Located in Tempe and buried on the ASU Campus, this was not a restaurant that we'd normally stumble upon.  However, I am very happy that I bid on this even though I knew nothing about it...why?  Because the food here is fantastic!  Here's what we ordered:Korean Style Baby Back Ribs, $14http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA#WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZAYukon Gold Potato Gnocchi, King Mushroom, $23http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ#2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQGrilled Filet w/Smoked Cheddar Bits, Asparagus, Cabernet Sauce, Crispy Onions, $36http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ#LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQGrand Marnier Creme Brulee, $6.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ#exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQDouble Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon, $6.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA#DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SAThe Korean Style Baby Back Ribs were simply amazing!  The BBQ Sauce was sweet & tangy with just the right amount of Ginger.  Yum!As everyone who knows me knows that I love Gnocchi....the Gnocchi here is delish.  The Grilled Filet was very good as well.  But the best part of dinner was the Dessert....The Better Half had the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee, which I sampled and was very good.  However, the best of the best was the Double Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon....yes, that's right Bacon lovers!  This Dessert delivers the goods on all levels.....it's Chocolatey, Sweet, and the Bacon adds a little salty/meaty goodness that causes your palette to jump for joy....my mouth is watering right now.There were 3 things that kept me from giving this place 5 Stars:1 - Parking.  It sucks.  Jockeying for position against ASU student parking plus the customers for this place and area businesses is not fun.  They should offer a valet service up front just for customers....I'd pay $5-$10 just to avoid the nonsense.2 - Seating.  We were seated outside....not our preference, but the size of the interior of the restaurant is tiny and we were told the wait was long to sit inside.  They have a huge outdoor seating area with giant trees.  We were sat at a table for 2, the table was very small and the servers had trouble with space when we had a bottle of Wine, Appetizers, and Bread.  When then entrees came out, it was a circle jerk to rotate old plate off, etc.  The furniture is patio furniture and the pads of the seats are left out overnight, dusty.  There was a lot of bird shit on the wall next to where we were seated and fallen leaves all around us.....I was constantly worried about something dropping onto my food.  It was our decision to accept sitting outside, so it's on me.  If I come back, will definitely not sit outside, don't care how nice the weather is.  3 - Service.  It was so/so.  We had to flag our waiter down when we were ready to order Wine....a huge pet peeve of mine.  Also, had to flag him down to order our food and refill Wine and Water glasses.  I think the majority of the wait staff here are ASU students.....they look young and don't know how to provide proper service.  When we walked up, we didn't know where to go because the hostess stand is outside and isn't obvious....2 hostesses looked at us and didn't say "Hi, how can we help you" or anything at all.  It was only when we started to wander around the patio area that they said "are you looking for someone?"....LMAO, yes I'm trying to get seated in your restaurant!  Too bad because the food is outstanding.I will give it another try and see how it goes now that I know about the things to avoid.Return Factor - 75%House of Tricks was a first date spot for my husband and I, and has since become our anniversary dinner tradition. We've always opted to eat outside on the patio, which is the highlight of this charming house-turned-restaurant. Yesterday was our 2 year anniversary and we had a wonderful dinner. The kale salad was fresh and delicious. We both enjoyed the ahi and halibut entrees which were prepared beautifully. We also split a bottle of wine and the chocolate-peanut butter pot-de-creme. I don't think we've ever had an issue with service here, although they were a little lax on the water last night.....I'm such a stickler for this....It's such a wonderfully romantic location, and a local gem!
Toyama=Yum, yum and yum!  A neighbor introduced me to this gem and am I certainly appreciative!  This is not a bass-thumping sushi mega-factory, but a small inviting space where the food is the feature attraction.  Everything I tried was fresh and perfectly presented.  Five stars, easy!When I was a naïve young man I used to go out and party on weekends. It was as if every Friday was the beginning of a national holiday requiring two days of intoxicated celebration. On any given night I would drop $10 to $30 on cover charges, $50 to $75 on drinks, $10 to $20 for the 2:00AM munchies and another $20 -$30 on a cab ride home. And what was I left with? A headache, some fuzzy memories and taking inventory of decisions made the night before.   Fortunately, with age comes wisdom. I have learned that a better way to celebrate life is to embrace unique opportunities and experiences.  If I am going to spend $100 tonight I am going to spend it wisely.  Eating at Toyama is a "value added" decision in my opinion.  I have gone twice now in as many weeks and both meals were fantastic.  My sister and brother-in-law joined me last Friday.  They were here visiting from California. We decided to go for broke and order the "Omakase" - chef's choice.  When it was all said and done they both agreed that a meal like this would have cost twice as much in LA.  While I can't remember every detail, some of the highlights were as follows...-        An amazing sashimi platter, with fresh tuna, yellowtail and uni.  -        Two different toro dishes. One Nigiri and one toro tartare dish.-        This incredible Spanish mackerel  sushi topped with a thin strip of sweet kelp.-        A custom roll with Thai hot sauce, tuna and avocado. Amazing.-        Salmon roe sushi soaked and rinsed the proper  way.It went on and on. Each new dish was a new indescribable flavor experience. One dish had this Japanese shisho leaf on it. We were all at the table trying to come up with a comparable flavor to describe it...."It tastes like a licorice-earthy-minty-nutmegy-etc..."...sounding like wine snobs trying to come up with just the right description, only this was food.  Really good food.  We got there early and were the only patrons for awhile so part of the amazing experience was the great conversation with our chef. We talked about golf, football, chef's knives, Santa Barbara, Japanese whisky, our favorite restaurants, etc... It was so interactive.  A great meal, a great evening... a great memory. Well worth the money.
Applebee's=Shame on me for not reading reviews before eating at this Applebee's.  Met some friends for lunch this week.  The wise choice for us was Applebee's (off Warm Springs) because it was one of the closest restaurants to my friends work.  What started as a wise choice, ended with an overall 3 star review.  If you read other reviews like I did not, you can probably guess what the issue was.  That's right, service here is amazingly slow.  My friend works in the buildings right next to this Applebees and one of our other friends works within 10 minutes.  The plan was for me to arrive and then let them know once I'm seating.  I just wish now that I ordered ahead of time, like 45 minutes ahead of time.  We ordered our food at 12 PM and by 12:35 PM, nothing.  The waitress was called over and we asked about our food.  Viola! Within 10 minutes we got our food after complaining.  This led to speed eating since both my friends had to get back to work.  Long story short, this place doesn't get packed for lunch, they are just slow for lunch.  This is also the same song and dance if you read the other reviews.  C'mon Applebee's...your customers are trying to tell you something. As for the food, I got their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I had an extra chicken breast added just for good measure.  The overall meal actually tasted pretty good, but that was just taste.  Texture wasn't so great. Both my chicken breast were a little dry. Overall, I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  I am giving them 3 stars only because I finished my plate.  Service needs to get better, at least faster.Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp:   http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2ur8pXFTFraCZnKwSEV4BA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQLovely Pair:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QHGjqvOeYqQEo01Gr6KlqQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ
El Sombrero Cafe=Why has it taken me so long to eat at El Sombrero?!?!?! I told the owner while eating there that I can't believe I am from las Vegas (we wont get into how many decades tee hee) and have never eaten here! Well, I think I was more into the historic meaning and longest running Mexican restaurant. I set the bar too high. I did however give a try to this mom & pop establishment. The woman who said she was the owner (theresa) was actually rude. She made comments I couldn't believe. A little girl was calling her name to tell her good by and to thank her for the food and she ignored her only finally to tell her "I'm busy not now". I was heartbroken for the little girl. The place is very small inside. They have booths along the walls and tables in the middle. I would recommend calling before heading down because they aren't open every night. In fact, they are open nights on Friday and Saturday and it is just until 9 pm. We started with a "Cheese Quesadilla". So simple yet so overpriced.She also brought us some chips and 2 kinds of salsas. I have to admit, the salsa wasn't the best. I ordered a combo platter that had a "Cheese Enchilada with Onions" and a "Guacamole Tostada" which also came with the normal beans and rice. These beans weren't normal though they are thick not runny and I would like that if they just had so,e flavor. I asked for my Enchilada to be made with a flour tortilla and it was big and very yummy. The guacamole was not fresh and frozen. I don't know if that is a regular thing or if she was out of avocados. Gross. The other 2 in my group enjoyed there meals too but, agreed the salsa and rice could use some help. The rice seemed like it was leftover and re-heated. Very dry.We capped the night off with some "Sopapillas and Honey". This by far was the best part of the night. Meals range from $10 and up. They have a Beer and Wine liquor license so if you order a margarita it will be made with wine.I don't plan on visiting here again anytime soon. This is noted as the oldest Mexican restaurant in Vegas. There are certain tables that have "reserved" on them for local lawyers such as Richard Harris and a few others who escape up to 3 times a week from their downtown office to have some lunch or even conduct a business meeting.Authentic Mexican food with plenty of parking at their private parking lot. I arrived just after noon for lunch and the dinning room was full of patrons.I went with the chili verde burrito which came with beans, rice and salad. The burrito was unique BC it contain pieces of strips of green chilies and delish tender pork. The sides, chips and salsa were also yummy.I gathered from the way the family greeted the clients that this is definitely a locals joint and and the owners appreciated the support with a number of signs - Thanking clients for their support!I'll definitely be returning.
Johnny Rockets=Four stars for the cheeseburger. It had been a long while since I had a Johnny Rockets burger. In fact, the last time I had Johnny Rockets was in college! However, during a recent shopping trip and movie night at the mall, we stopped by for burgers before the show. This is a delicious burger! It is juicy and has the special sauce and is just fatty goodness. It's definitely worth the visit if you're in the mood for a juicy burger on the go.
RA Sushi Bar Restaurant=I want to hate Ra because, well, it's Ra. But the truth is, every time I come here I leave happy and satisfied. Being a Veggie, sushi is really hit-or-miss but I always seem to get pretty lucky here. Tonight was no exception. Everything was really full of flavor and really fresh. You are probably thinking that it is hard to mess up veggies, but I have had some bad sushi before (Stingray!!!!!!) I was stoked when I asked the waitress to recommend a Chard (they had four) and she actually made a suggestion. I was really happy with it and was even more delighted that she pointed out something on the happy hour menu. I really like the atmosphere. I have a thing for balls. I mean red orbs. Only complaint is that the music is normally wayyyyy too loud. The service is always really good, so they balance one another out.Oh...we also tried the Cinnamon tempura ice cream with raspberry drizzle. OH MY FREAKING GOD. It was... absolutely orgasmic! YUM!Now if they could only fix the parking issue...10:30pm on a Saturday night. My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first). Place is hopping. We take a seat at the sushi bar.The Waitress:  "Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?"Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, "yes."Waitress:  "Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too."Me: What the fuck, bitch. "Uh, ok"Dear Ra Waitress,I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employees, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed. It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine. I was hardly the last customer in there. There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me. If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food? Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot. I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined. Thanks for that.   Sincerely,MorganSo I've been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. That's it, Ra - you've lost another customer.
Sushi Factory=I feel like I'm swimming upstream here. If you have a big appetite and your sushi bill is normally around a bill for one person, I'd suggest checking this place out. Yeah it's in a strip mall and the fish isn't what you'd expect at Nobu but the sushi is great quality for all you can eat. Plus you can order 1/2 rolls and they have around 30 to choose from. All the Nigiri, yes there's a limit on ama ebi and uni but how the frick do you expect a place to stay in business and make a living, give me a frickin break, these reviewers are out of their gawdamm mind. You can also eat as many fresh oysters as you like, that's a deal in itself. My friend and I ordered the sashimi/tempura meal and it was served with 2 shrimp tempura, 2 eggplant, 1 sweet potato, 1 broccoli, and 1 onion. 8 pieces of sashimi, a cut california roll, miso soup, rice and salad for $13.50. What a deal. My other 2 friends had the all you can eat and they loved it. $80 for 4 including all the free ice tea refills. Definitely a deal in my book. Yes I'm a fan. 4 well deserved stars.BEFORE: Surprisingly I rated this place a 4! Before I get on about the food and service, I'd like to say that I have been a customer for years! It started off as one of my favorite sushi joints in town until I noticed the customer service was not on the level as I remembered it to be.  The food was also not that great either, where they piled on rice and cream cheese into each roll! So, if I was a yelper back then, I would have given this place a solid 2!AFTER a year or so, I decided to go back to see if there had been any change.  When I walked in, I noticed the place had been painted, and was definitely much better looking than I can remember.  I did AYCE, and as much as I love sushi, I don't know how  to use chopsticks (Yes, sad story. haha). So, I always ask for a fork =). The server came running back with my fork like he was some sort of knight-in-shining-armor, which is a good sign for me, because everyone usually forgets my darn fork =(.So the food came, and I noticed a definite change, it has become even better than I can remember! The service was also wonderful. The servers were much more observant of their customer's needs, and they were just adorable! *NOTE: Another thing I remember is that they have a Ladie's Night Special on Wednesdays, where AYCE dinner is the lunch price! Take advantage ladies! And another good thing is they are open late! I think til 3am? (I'll have to update the times and specials as soon as I go back)
Monti's La Casa Vieja=First of all, I worked at Monti's twelve years ago. I have seen what goes on behind closed doors and I will come here every chance I get.Michael Monti took over La Casa Vieja from his father, who won it in a poker game as legend has it. Not only is the building historic for being the first estate in Hayden's Ferry (as Tempe was called way back when), not only is it the birthplace of the late Senator Carl Hayden (who was born in the dining room off to the left when you first walk in ... before it was a restaurant, silly), there is much history in the restaurant itself. I attended a book talk & signing at Monti's by the architect that designed the famous upside-down pyramid that is Tempe City Hall. In attendance were a number of former Tempe mayors and architects of Mill Avenue (before it was overrun by chains). These were the OGs of Tempe; they had a lot of stories about old city politics, backroom deals, and midnight hour resolutions. Those backroom deals were in the backrooms of Monti's.When you first walk into the lobby, you'll be greeted by a cadre of hosts. Monti's has a seating capacity in excess of 1,000 people, so it takes a lot of people to keep things running. You need a host to show you around or you will get lost.The lobby has a few walls of photographs with Monti's history, including one of the infamous Senator McCarthy. When he was finally disgraced, he went to "recuperate" in the dry desert air of Arizona (today's version is "spend more time with the family"). Could Monti's have been McCarthy's refuge? Nobody seems to know ... or care, but the photo is there, anyway.I should probably tell you a little about the food. The steaks are excellent. This is not quite Ruth's Chris Steak house, but for the relatively low price, it's pretty damn close! If they err, they err on the side of overcooking your steak, so keep that in mind.The baked potatoes are awesome, crisped on the bottoms. Sometimes they're a little charred instead of crisped, but always good.The Roman Bread is addictive, especially if you dip it in the house-made ranch dressing. They make their own ranch and Roquefort dressings from scratch. Take advantage!I like the sirloin burger. It's better than just a hamburger.It drives the bartenders nuts if you order a bunch of Monti's Coffees after dinner because they're tedious to make, but oh-so worth it. Just tip them well. (Galliano drizzed in the glass, frosted with sugar, flashed until it caramelizes, with Grand Marnier, brandy, coffee, whipped cream, and more Galliano ... I think.)If it's not too busy, see if anyone can give you a little history of the place and maybe a tour. It's huge, with rooms everywhere ... you'll hardly believe it.One star for being the last local business in Mill AveOne star for being family ownedOne star for good foodOne star for an eclectic atmosphereI was pleased with Monti's. I'm not much for steak or Tempe but I was pleasantly surprised. The hostess who sat us could use a lesson in patience, however. We had just sat down in the room to the right of the entrance after being told our wait would be five to ten minutes (it was 8:15  and our reservations were for 8:30). Almost one minute later the hostess was calling our name once, twice, three times before the other hostess told her to check the other room. Our service was a bit slow, I saw a number of other tables around us served their salads and starters much before we received ours. The wait staff seems to be primarily college students.When my salad did arrive it was decent but the roquefort dressing was very good. The men in my party both had steak which they both enjoyed greatly. Both ordered medium rare and the steaks were cooked perfectly and very tender. I had the chicken marsala with a side of spaghetti. The spaghetti sauce wasn't anything like Mama's but it wasn't terrible, either. I found a sage leaf in my sauce which I didn't mind but wasn't sure if it was left as decoration or forgotten in the sauce. The marsala was good.I would say I was most pleased with our bottle of wine, a Rosenblum Zinfandel, and the creme brulee dessert. I may go back to try the shrimp cocktail appetizer and possibly a steak.The old house is a fitting name for this joint. A old house that has not seen a pest exterminator in years, an old house that still serves food from the yester years.. I've been here on many occasions and the food is always  fair to poor, the filet mignon is either a joke or from some other animal I have never heard of. The salads wilted, the croutons stale, the bread stale, even the smell in this place is stale. I hesitated before writing this review but 4 out of 5 visits were awful. I really (yes really) did see a roach on my last and final visit. The service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty. Go somewhere else for a steak, it's worth the extra few bucks.I've driven past this place many times, and I always thought it kind of felt out of place on Mill.  I'd heard mixed reviews, and obviously it isn't super popular here on yelp.  But when I saw the Living Social deal (two drinks, any appetizer and any two entrees) it was time to try them out.  Upon arrival, got a nice quick tour of the building, with a little history of the oldest building in Tempe by the host who sat us, thought that was a nice touch.We were there a little early, so we successfully brought down the demographic as most of the patrons were quite older.  Granted, it was game night @ ASU so I'm sure that had something to do with it.  Started with a couple of drinks and the blackened prime rib appetizer which was tasty - even though I prefer my prime rib medium... the creamy horseradish sauce was bomb.For entrees, we got the seabass and porterhouse, as they were the most expensive items available.  And as it turns out, they were both spectacular.  Perfectly cooked, amazing presentation and excellent service throughout.  The sides were mashed potatoes and chipotle mac & cheese, both really tasty.  The GM stopped by a couple times to check on us, and was quite cordial. All in all, it was a really nice meal, and much better than expected.  I had enough left of the porterhouse to make a perfect steak and eggs Sunday breakfast, so that's always a nice bonus.  As far as steakhouses in the area, this place is 2nd only to Durant's in my book - which says a lot.Do you want some sad news? No one does.But, You have to hear it anyway. Monti's is closing down. Not just for a little remodel ,but for ever and ever!It is really a sad day today. We went to Monti's tonight to try to get one last experience here. But, there are no walk ins at all. It is strictly reservations. We tried to get reservations last week, they were full up until the closing date. Which will be Nov. 17 2014I really loved this place. But, it is all gone now. It was the oldest Business in the Valley,at least in Tempe. Thank you to the Monti Family for all your great years of great food. Boun Sierra
Pinnacle Peak General Store=I'm a little bit country. I'm a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak General Store is all country baby. 100% U.S. grade countrilicous! Well, ok, it's in North Scottsdale so it's got a pretty yuppified clientele. Part gas station, convienence store, cafe and post office....this is the cutest place ever. Was kinda my morning hang when I lived at DCRanch. Cup o joe, and the #1 Breakfast with 1 pancake, 2 eggs and bacon. I'm tellin' ya...it's good. Hard to screw up bacon and eggs so I'll rave about my pcake...a bit crispy around the edges and full of buttermilk flavor. Syrup is heated just right and comes in a squeeze bottle the waitress pulls out of her apron pocket. Is that a squeeze bottle of syrup in your apron or are you just happy to see me? Coffee is sturdy and aromatic...like my lesbian cousin Rita. I haven't eaten off the lunch menu...to me it's all about breakfast. My friends have ordered and enjoyed canteloupe with cottage cheese and some kind of omelette which escapes me now, cuz, frankly, I'm not a big fan of the omelette. Childhood trauma and I can't go into it now. The funniest thing about this place are the copper pots and other bric a brac hanging from the rafters that are all for sale. Some of the pots are like $100! OMG....They also have a gas pump that's like $5,000...I guess that's where North Scottsdale meets the country general store. So hitch up the wagon and skeedaddle on up to the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Tell 'em Thomas sent yaFor some reason, this general store makes me feel like I'm about to go on a fun road trip, so it's a perfect place to visit if I want to pretend like I'm going on a trip. I think I feel this way because the general store reminds me of spots we would visit on California road trips during my childhood. This is a gas station, gift shop, post office and delicious diner all in one! It's absolutely worth visiting and seeing for yourself. The general store is filled with knick knacks that include new items and antique items. I'm pretty sure everything in the store is for sale, even the fixtures on the walls! The post office is fast and efficient and a perfect one stop shop. The element that stands out the most is the restaurant. The moment you walk in, a scent of syrup welcomes you and begs you to sit down and enjoy some pancake goodness. You can choose between sitting on the pretty patio or the funky inside diner. It was pretty crowded when we stopped by so we sat inside. I really like this diner because they offer meals which include a pancake, eggs and bacon/sausage or a waffle, eggs and bacon/sausage etc. So, if you are craving some breakfast bread to go with your eggs, you have the option to enjoy both! The food was above diner quality and hearty. It's a perfect place to have a casual yet fun breakfast on a weekend. The patio is also dog-friendly so bring Fido along!
Pei Wei=I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:-it's cheap-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)-there is plenty to choose from on the menu-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!
Macayo's Mexican Restaurants=The whole reason I moved to Phoenix was for a job.  Yes, I got a job here in Phoenix and moved here just for that.  California was showing no signs of ever opening up the job market soon so I did what I had to do.  So far, I'm really liking it and finding some cool new places to go and great places to eat.  MacAya's is one of those discoveries.  After spending two weeks with a group of people in a training class, some of us decided to go out and celebrate with lunch on Good Friday, which was a half day for us.  The company was great and I found the place very easily so that was a plus too.  I thought the open patio was awesome and I can see this place hoppin on a Friday or Saturday night.  Even at lunch they had $2 beers!  The service was a little slow, the chips and salsa were ok, and my enchiladas were pretty good, not great, but good.  Honestly, I think it's the atmosphere that got me though.  They had this big outdoor bar and lots of space on the patio, lots of tables and chairs.  I loved the outdoor waterfall too.  So in my opinion, the food is a 2 and I'm giving it another start for the atmosphere.  If you don't expect much when you go, you'll be fine  :)A-OK In my book. Some friends invited us out for Mexican food in Tempe and this is the place they picked. Not crazy busy on a Saturday night at all, which was nice not having to wait. Our food was good, came out in a reasonable time, service was good.... everything was just good. Nothing bad nothing amazing. If you are in the area and in the mood for some Mexican food, give them a try!
Razz's Restaurant & Catering=It was grand opening night. The space is lovely and filled with great art every where you look. Razz and his wife were excellent hosts as if you were coming in to their home making sure everyone was having a good time. The service was impeccable. I guess this place is closed during summer months I had no idea this was even here I had no idea what to expect. The only complaint I have is there wasnt enough non meat options but I bet on a regular day the regular menu would have more to chose from.The Sepetember Wine Dinner as followsOxtail Hash with Truffle GlazeBaby mixed green bundle, toasted Macadamia nut vinaigrettePaired with Pouilly Fusse 04The presentation was so neat pics coming soon. I could not get enough of the greens and dressing.Scallop en Croute (The hugest scallop I have ever seen EVER) Seared with Fois Gras duxelle in pastry, roasted strawberry & rhubarb compote with a Mersault '04. This was so frikn good HELLO YUMGASM!!I didnt have the rest of the pairing but they seemed to go over pretty well. There was Veal Loin en Papillote steamed in a parchment bag with wild mushrooms, asparagus & morbier cheese and the main course was a Peppered Beef Tenderloin w french green beans & almonds, spinach pancake, roasted potatoes with garlic.. I didnt care for the pancake and I hate pepper and beef lol but the green beans were spectacular seriously the best I have ever had, I dont usually like garlicy things and the potato was awesome I didnt waste any. Pecan Sponge Pie with a bunch of different berries was totally heavenly. All in all I really cant wait to go back when I can pick what to try!! If you have the money to splurge you need to try this place fa sho!!we sat at the chefs table and i love the eye contact Razz makes. some people never look you in the eye and thats a huge pet peeve of mine. but razz locks eyes and i love it. i guess you could call me an eye-locking whore.Be sure to only eat at the chefs table and just let Razz decide what you're going to eat and drink.  the first course was like a crab cake w a curry sauce and carmelized ginger. on top of bitter greens. i can't even explain it other than it was like little angels dancing in my mouth. the 2nd course made me decide that if Razz cooks me seafood I will LOVE it. it was like red snapper with a sauce that i'm just going to call butter bc it was so good and light. and then the snapper was on top of a bed of beans that were to die for. i'm sure there was a great explanation but i couldn't hear Razz over my thoughts. the "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMs" and the "OHHHHHHHHs" going on in my head were very loud. I'm sure my eyes looked like they were going to pop out of my head.this is where things start to get blurry but i'm pretty sure our 3rd course was lobster, crab and some other shell fish in filo dough on top of a tomato, basil and garlic puree. it was soooo super tasty.next was my 2nd favorite course- it was oxtail on top of a queso crisp with an avocado relish. YUM! YUMMY YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!! 5th course- my least favorite- i learned that Razz can make me like seafood but he can't make me like duck. I was super adventurous and figured i'd probably like it but oh my gosh, sooooo not for me. 6th course- delicious rice mixed in with oysters...or was it clams? or muscles? you get the idea, right? whatever it was, i did not find a pearl in the middle.  it had a spanish flare. it was very good. i was pretty overwhlemed and stuffed beyond measure by this point so i can't remember. and i had a glass of wine and i'm a weak drinker so for me that means borderline drunk. last was dessert- it came with a slice of passionfruit cake (not my thing), a slice of a coconut type cake (super good) and a wedge of this very intense piece of chocolate (that was totally my thing). we were so super full we had to box it but it was tasty.I could be mixing everything up and saying it wrong but the important thing to know is that "anything made in this building is the best and everyone will like"- Razzon that note, i can't wait to go back!!!!! he was sooo fun to sit and eat with, definitely be sure to eat the chefs table. BTW- restaurants.com has a $100 gift card when you spend $200- which is SOOOO doable. we had 6 courses, plus dessert and 3 glasses of wine and our bill came out to $196.196-100  coupon____96  / 2 diners= about $50 per person plus tip.Thank you Razz and staff for a delightful meal tonight!  I've driven by Razz's Restaurant countless times over the years, and in addition to the glowing reviews on Yelp, my friend and former boss, Linda L, raves and raves about how Razz's is her favorite restaurant in the Valley.  So, after all of this time, I finally made it in - partially because of the convenient location, but mostly because I wanted to try something new.We had a group of six, and we were celebrating my mom's birthday.  I made an 8pm reservation and we waited just a couple of minutes when we arrived before we were seated at our table.  PJ was our waiter and took fabulous care of us.  Fresh bread and water were served promptly, and Jared chose a bottle of Argentenian Cabernet-Syrah blend  for the table...We shared the Baked Cheese in Phyllo, Crispy Calamari, and Bah Mie Goreng as appetizers... all were delicious.  The calamari had a unique creamy preparation and a major kick to it.  For entrees, three of us (including me) had the Arroz con Mariscos (Razz doesn't skimp on the seafood - this dish was huge and flavorful; kind of like a combination between paella and risotto).  My mom went with the shortribs (which I tried and fell in love with instantly), mom-in-law had a macadamia encrusted grouper special which was supposedly incredible as well, and Jared had the Chicken Scaloppini which he said was "off the charts!"Mom was given a complimentary birthday dessert which we all shared, and was the perfect sweet ending to our meal.  I didn't get a chance to chat with Razz but I will have to return and sit at the Chef's Table next time for sure.  And I can guarantee that "next time" will be sooner rather than later!I have to hand it to my husband.  I'm the Yelper, yet he managed to find a place for my birthday that I did not even have bookmarked.  As we pull into the strip mall, I'm thinking "Oregano's? Really?"  But it was Razz's!  And the Chef's Table (more like a counter) to boot!  Be prepared to get to know those next to you as seating is very tight though.  As many small plates you can handle (I handled 7, thank you) for $10 a pop.  One of my favorites was the seafood beggar's purse with a red chili sauce, but truthfully, I loved all but the last (I really never know when to quit).  Several of the dishes incorporated southwest flavors which is a huge plus for me, too.  And Razz was a delightful host assisting us with wine selections to complement the varied menu.Would definitely do this again, but maybe with fewer courses.  By the time 7 rolled around, I was rolling around.11/30/12I've wanted to visit Razz's Restaurant for YEARS, but could never get the timing right.  I met the owner/chef years ago and would occasionally see him where I work, so I kept telling myself to go have dinner at Razz' soon.  It's part his fault, really, since he keeps changing his business hours throughout the year. Nowadays, his resto is open for dinner on Tuesdays through Saturdays and closed on Sundays and Mondays.  For two or three months in the summer, he closes shop and visits Europe, and then comes back and opens on Fridays and Saturdays for a couple of months before operating full-on for five days starting around October, but don't quote me on this, as I'm a bit hazy on the details.What I am not hazy on, though, is that the food I had here rocked!  While on break at work, I decided that tonight would be the night to try Razz'.  I called up around 630p to make reservation plans for 830p, but said that I most likely will show up earlier.  "Would that be a problem?," I asked, and he said no.  He asked if I would like to sit at the bar/counter, and I asked if I could just be seated somewhere quiet, since I work in a very noisy environment all day, so he said he'd seat me at a booth...Wasn't too hard to find parking, and I finally found out why the place looks deserted from the outside--the "front" really isn't a front, but just a blacked-out window, and the entrance is in the back.  The restaurant is larger than I expected it to be, and I found the interior to be very inviting and, dare I say, almost seductive?  I liked some of the paintings that graced the walls, and some just didn't fit in with the rest.  I'd have to say that these "off" paintings must've been the ones for sale.  (I read on Razz' website that local artists' have works on display.)One of the two hiccups during tonight's service was my first serving of bread, which arrived slightly cold and not as fresh as I would've liked.  No matter, as I ate the crispiest of the crusts, and left the rest in the basket and asked for a second batch http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=wMHMwYLfMh1v9Ens1XxE-Q#wMHMwYLfMh1v9Ens1XxE-Q, explaining my fetish of eating just the warm/hot crusts to my server, who willingly obliged- I love that!  I also asked if I could sample a couple of reds before settling on a glass of wine.  The answer again was "yes, of course."  I felt like dancing, because I felt like I was getting great service!  A man arrived shortly to assist me in finding the right red, so I asked him if he was a sommelier.  He said no, but that he will try to answer any questions I might have.  After a few questions I had on the cabs and a blend (nothing too dry, please!), he suggested I try a sample of the Barra Mendocino pinot noir '09 ($15/glass), and I loved it, and so I ordered a glass to go with one of the four dinner specials that night, the Peppered NY strip with mashed potatoes, a sub of sauteed greens, and fried onion strings on top, $30.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=Oped4Oy1UNJbQQMdKubWoA#Oped4Oy1UNJbQQMdKubWoA  I asked for it to be cooked medium (pink throughout), but it was a bit on the rare side... I still enjoyed it very much, though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=D8vynNUfwYSNgupa4nLvvQ#D8vynNUfwYSNgupa4nLvvQ  I must warn you that this was indeed pepper-encrusted, so if pepper isn't your thing, you might want to opt for something else.  The second hiccup of the night was that, while I mentioned an allergy to mushrooms, I thought I detected something that looked like mushrooms on top of the steak, but these pieces didn't have the feel of 'shrooms.  I'd say they reminded me of water chestnuts, but a server confirmed that they were truffles, which also made me a bit wary, since truffles are similar to 'shrooms... I decided I'd avoid any more bites of these for the time being.  The mashed potatoes were buttery-smooth and chunky at the same time- I always try to control myself when it comes to white potatoes, but these were hard to stay away from, and the greens had a lovely dark-green color to them, were melt-in-your-mouth, but had a nice crisp at first bite, and they tasted tantalizingly of roasted peanuts, even though I was told that Razz' does not use any peanuts in any of the dishes here.  The fried onion strings just added even more fun to this dish (the more textures, the better, I say), and I was loving every bite!For dessert, I settled on the Triple chocolate torte http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=yykeweLCsZcFrDdmivd8gw#yykeweLCsZcFrDdmivd8gw and a cup of brewed coffee.  Again, this course was exquisite!  It packed quite a punch of cacao, yet wasn't too rich- together with the coffee, I almost ate the entire slice!I shall return soon, and next time, I'm sitting at the counter!For my 1700th review, I'm writing about Razz's.  Thanks to Groupon, we've been able to enjoy Razz's Restaurant twice.  Located in an older shopping center on Shea & Scottsdale Rd, I recommend that you make advanced reservations and that you request a table away from the windows if it's during the hot months.  The reason is because the tables near the windows are very hot and the AC here is inadequate because it's an older building with inefficient insulation.Now, on to the food and drink....during our 2 visits, we ordered:Parmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin, $25.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVA#_JHsWz6QExzzb0AA1EnFVAPeppered New York Strip, $32.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1A#oBcMb5p-hvyYty1cnUMV1AMixed Greens Salad, $10.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLg#dC5ZAKSQQZ9Elhvngs2iLghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLig#rPW_HwkpUZ5Bu4fRW6KLigPietra Santa Merlot, $48http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQA#hls4h8s8ve_f0F-V8ksaQAHahn Meritage, $60Crespelles, $14.95Grilled Rack of Lamb Chops, $38.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9Pw#W1f-8cJo9etFxHqTCa_9PwPan Roasted Duck Breast, $26.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3A#1HJTB9Obc8QtMtNrZwfz3APraline Hazelnut Torte, $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQ#6oN1CA-kP7F01Tl304S9ZQTriple Chocolate Torte. $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlA#72impFT4NM8YAheeriXDlAWhere do I begin?  Hmmm...well, the Mixed Green Salad is awesome. They have a house dressing that's to die for and goes well with the fresh vegetables.  A perfect way to start a meal.  I ordered on both visits, it's that good.The Peppered NY Strip Steak was nothing to write home about....very average.  However, the Parmesan Encrusted Pork Tenderloin is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  It has a perfect combination of sweet and meaty flavor to it....well done Razz, well done!  The Pan Roasted Duck Breast and Grilled Rack of Lamb Chops are also fantastic!  We enjoyed 3 out of the 4 entrees we had over the 2 dinners....great job team Razz!For Dessert we had the Praline Hazelnut Torte and the Triple Chocolate Torte.  Both were very good.The Wine we had on both nights was spectacular and went well with our dinner.  They offer a decent selection of Wine.The restaurant also doubles as an art gallery, so you can find paintings on the walls for sale....if that's your gig.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/razzs-restaurant-and-catering-scottsdale?select=WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2g#WoHdKk0R4Mip-GdlUe_Z2gWe didn't realize that the kitchen was actually right in front of the bar seats, so the bar seats are premium seats because you can watch Razz and the team cook...Razz will also come up and greet you if you're sitting at the bar.  However, since we didn't book reservations in advance, those seats were taken on both nights we visited.  If we come back, we'll try to book a couple of seats at the bar.Return Factor - 90%I've wanted to take Mom here, and she finally relented after all these years of saying no.  Could she have missed me after being away for eleven days? She ordered the Peppered blue cheese NY strip, and I the Pork Schnitzel.  (Darn! I wanted steak!)  I would've enjoyed a glass of red, but she isn't a fan of wine, and I was tired from running around all day AND I also just came from massage session, AND I was driving us home after.  Mom really enjoyed the steak, cooked medium, with two sides- mashed potatoes and a vegetable bundle, while I found the candied purple cabbage that garnished the pork schnitzel, to be too sweet.  The entree also included mashed potatoes and a veggie bundle, but mine was missing!  I'd requested that carrots be omitted from the bundle, and when I'd asked about the missing bundle, our server said that the carrots could not be omitted, so I said I'd take a bundle, anyway.  More veggies for Mom to enjoy leftovers with!  Note to self: Next time, go for the steak!  The table bread and butter were d'lish!Service was sweet and friendly- thanks, Candace!I don't think Mom will be so quick to say NO the next time I offer to take her here!
Taco Bell="I read the news today...Oh boy!"http://tinyurl.com/ylpza9aGlenn Bell Jr. died this past weekend at the tender age of 86...a long life of slingin' taco's to be sure:)I hadn't been to Taco Bell in almost 4 years, until today...I was moved to drop by Taco Bell in a sort of tribute to Glenn...one of the more prominent "voices" during my formative years:)This Taco Bell in particular...store # 22354 is one of the more important spiritual touch points for paying tribute to Glenn...Scottsdale was the home of the first Taco Bell franchise (and the fact that Westaco, Inc's. HQ is in the same lot with this store makes them the defacto, if not actual, heir to the legacy of Glenn Bell:)I had my first Taco Bell taco in Corvallis, Oregon in 1970 when I hit college with a mighty crash:)It was the second time I had ever had "Mexican" food..the first time was a week prior at a place called Taco Time in Eugene, Oregon.I was thrilled to find out about pizza, Italian food, pizza, Mexican, pizza, chinese take out, pizza...you get the drift...I was a country boy in the (for me) big city and I was going to find out all about life's pleasures...starting with taco's:)I was hooked on Taco Bell for a long time (a time that, coincidentally, was the time when I had very little money yet still needed to eat occasionally:)Taco Bell and the others filled the role of reasonably tasty maintenance eating for a long, long time...it was a truism in 1975 that no one...no one... could eat $5.00 worth of Taco Bell at a sitting, all by themselves:)Could.Not.Be. Done!It may still be "truish" with the "cheapo" menu:)But it has never really been very good:(That was something I actually didn't discover until a trip to LA with a girlfriend (the same trip that I discovered In-n-Out:)...real Mexican food is very different than the goop that Glenn had sold me over the years...and very much better:)But that didn't stop me from eating at Taco Bell...beggars can't be chooser's...and I was a beggar for a few years.Today was a nostalgia stop for me (as was my last visit to a Taco Bell a few years ago), as well as a tribute to Glenn:)I was more interested in watching my "beefy burrito" being made this time...the ladies in the kitchen pulled various levers in response to the computerized instructions for my order on the monitors overhead...the different shades of unidentifiable goop that cascaded onto the flour tortillas...the quick hand movements of their ritual wrapping of the burrito (I once dated a girl that worked at Taco Bell...she knew how to wrap a burrito...but that's another story:)It still isn't very good food...but everyone at this location is sweet and pleasant, my order was correct, I was in severe need of a retox after a 6 miler this morning and I did manage to eat about 2/3 of the burrito...even with mulitple "bags" of hot sauce it was not very good:(But that's not the fault of the sweet ladies behind the counter, nor of Westaco, nor of Glenn Bell...I think when Pepsi or YUM or whoever got their hands on Taco Bell...well...I'm not writing this to get on a rant about corporate agendas vs. quality:)I wanted to give them an extra star...just for being who they are and where they are, but I hear the spirit of Glenn Bell telling me "don't do it, Donald...make them earn it" :-)That's all I need, another voice in my head...Thanks Glenn:)Taco Bell aka "Taco Hell" brings back amazing memories from my high school days.  There was a Taco Bell located right across the street from BHS (my high school), and if memory serves, the drive-thru was open pretty damn late; maybe even 24 hours?!  At the time, my friends and I made many a "run for the border," and I remember the food being great!Either I was really drunk back then or Taco Bell has gone down hill or my taste buds have matured quite a bit since then, because after eating Taco Bell for dinner last night, I no longer "quiero Taco Bell."  Or maybe I ordered wrong?I'm quite nauseous thinking about what I ordered (and ate) last night:-1 Mexican Pizza (540 calories / 30 grams of fat)-1 Chicken Soft Taco (180 calories / 6 grams of fat)-1 Pintos and Cheese (170 calories / 6 grams of fat)I didn't know there was a "Drive-Thru Diet® Menu" until looking at their website just now either... oh well, I'm eating for two right now!I also didn't realize the slogan changed to "think outside the bun" until actually listening to the radio commercials as I drove home with my food in my lap last night.    I will say that the drive-thru was super quick and my order was right and all for under $6.  What a bargain!I'm sure Taco Bell is still a great option when you're out late, have had a few too many, and/or are eating on a budget.  But I don't recommend it when you're completely sober and it's a normal hour.  Probably not the healthiest option for the baby in my belly either... Bottom line: I don't plan on returning for many years to come, although I do have a pretty big high school reunion coming up next year, so I may just have to give it one more shot!
Peoria Cafe=This is a local cafe and is pretty crowded on the weekend for breakfast.  It's what you want to look for when you're not from the area and want to have a good, authentic local dining experience.  The breakfast is relatively basic and the food pretty good.  The portions are quite large, perhaps to compensate for the quality and taste but overall it's a good value.
Roy's Scottsdale=Saturday night, no reservation, my choice was to wait 45 minutes for a table or take a table in the bar.  I opted for the bar.  I should have waited or went somewhere else.I had eaten at Roy's in Philadelphia, which was an awesome experience.  I expected that same in Scottsdale.  Didn't happen.I started out with my favorite drink, an Original Hawaiian Martini.  They are not cheap with the alcohol in the drink, it's very potent.  For dinner, I opted for choices on the Prix Fix menu.  My starter was a Hawaiian Crunch Winter roll.  It was great, made with shrimp tempura and avocado.  For my entree, I selected the Panang-style tiger shrimp with vegetable coconut curry and jasmine rice.  Very good combination of flavors, but could have been served a little warmer.  Dessert was the always awesome "Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle".  This dessert is always to die for.  It's the best  dessert I have ever had anywhere!!Other than the slightly cold entree, the thing that amazed me about this restaurant was the fact that the staff didn't intercede when a nearby customer managed to annoy me all evening long.  This guy was in the restaurant bar, supposedly waiting for his brother.  Well, I was there for over an hour and the brother never showed up.  Go figure.  But, in the meantime, this guy managed to annoy me, tell me strange stories, sit at my table (until I asked him to leave), go back to this table, remove papers from his bag, bring them back to my table and spread them out, (until I asked him to leave again), used my cell phone to call his brother, mother, sister, god knows who else.  But at least while he was on my cell phone, he wasn't bothering me.  He even begged me for a ride and helped himself to some of my food.  You get the picture.  I can not believe that the staff allowed this to happen.  It's outrageous.  Other customers noticed, I guess I should have demanded to speak to a manager to have situation resolved, but I didn't want to make a scene.  I couldn't believe it was happening or that is was allowed to happen!!!  I even had to sneak out a side door when this nut wasn't looking, so he wouldn't follow me.  Completely nuts.  I think a restaurant of this caliber has an obligation to protect it's customers.
Sushi 101 Bar and Grill=After treating Mom and myself to both a relaxing and totally rejuvenating 90-minute massage sessions at SWIHA, we headed to Sushi 101 (my second visit, her first!) for happy hour.  We arrived at around 5:30p and sat ourselves at the sushi counter, said hello to Tots, who smiled and greeted us warmly.  As I've said before, don't let his young looks fool you- he's competent, he's quick, and he even has a great memory!  All it took was for me to say "No *..." and he completed my sentence by recalling all the food allergies I have to worry about when dining at a sushi establishment!  Kudos to Tots, and to Sushi 101 for employing employees like him!Since I was dining again with Mom, I forgot to take photos, but I assure you, we thoroughly enjoyed EACH and EVERY dish we tried (well, all but one*, that is)...Two bowls of miso soup- Complimentary, if sitting at the sushi counter.  Was surprised to find out that their miso base did not contain *!  I've had to avoid miso for so long now, that it was such a treat to enjoy again.  Lovely, rich flavor, with scallions and tofu, but a little bit on the salty side.  I'll be sure to have some everytime I visit!  Vegetable tempura; $3/2 pcs. sweet potato, 2 pcs. zucchini, 1 pc. onion ring, 1 pc. broccoli- We ended up ordering another serving, for a total of two dishes, $6*Gyoza, $3/5 pcs.- Couldn't try these myself as they contained mushrooms.  Mom decided she won't order these pork-filled dumplings again, saying they weren't very good.  I noticed she ate all but one ;)Spider roll, $6.95/5 pcs.- Pure joy!Rainbow roll, $8.95/8 pcs.- Sublime!Volcano roll, $9.50/8 pcs.- Scallops, crab, asparagus, yamogobo, and smelt roe!  Served warm, and will definitely be a "repeat guest performer" at many happy hour meals to come. Total bill $45.00, including 20% tip, for two people.  Bill is for food only, as we didn't order any beverages save iced water.  Offered to split a bottle of Tsingtao with her ($2 or $2.50), but she turned it down.  No biggie.  I'm all about eating my calories anyway :D Again, if my descriptions of the rolls sound like they're lacking in traditional ingredients, you're not mistaken.  I've had to ask for substitutions as I'm allergic to many sushi ingredients.  Another reason why I love patronizing Tots and Sushi 101- they're so accommodating!!Usually sushi restaurants, that know they have bellow average nigiri, make up for it by having unique and tasty rolls. This place fails on both counts....Nigiri: Fish was stale. Almost like it was frozen just a few minutes ago, so there was almost no taste. The rice was disgusting.Rolls: We didn't finish most of the rolls. Not because there was too much food, but because it was hard keeping it down.Why two stars? Well the service was great, as were their miso soup and green tea. So if you want some tasty miso with tea.... this is your place.My friend from Arizona begged me not to give them a bad review, because he comes here a lot. This is the best I can do.... I was seriously going to write something a lot worse.Read this carefully:They have a POLICY to STEAL your MONEY.Mangers are telling waitstaff to "round checks up" - so when you get your bill of $8.65 and give them a $20, you will get back $11 and no change. Sure a disappearing $ .45 doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is when it is your money. Then the waiter tells you that his boss told him, and other waitstaff told him that's "the way it's done." This happened to me not 20 minutes ago.Stealing. Policy. Illegal.(never mind the mediocre food....)Congratulations Sushi 101.  You are my first one star review.  I have high standards for this category and you get to go down in my Yelp history as breaking my 1 star cherry. This is the WORST sushi I have ever had.  I would rather eat the stuff from Kyoto Bowl.  In fact, in comparison Kyoto bowl sounds rather delicious to me at the moment, that is if you didn't turn me off from sushi altogether. Happy hour schmappy hour, I can't believe people pay to eat this crap.  On top of that the service was awful.  I had a beer and finished it not half way into my time there and was never asked if I wanted another. After that I find on my bill they factored gratuity into my tip.  The only time I know this to be a common practice is for groups of 6 or more. There were five of us.  I think they have to build in the tip because they know they are awful and wouldn't make any money otherwise.College kids, I know you don't have much money but trust me, there are plenty of decent or even great sushi places out there that offer amazing HH deals. I cringe to think of how many kids will have their first sushi experience here and will never know how truly delicious and amazing sushi actually is.I've driven by Sushi 101 many of times and never really had that urge to try it. My son and wife always has Japanese urges and we were in Tempe so what the heck. I walked in and the place isn't too big or small. Nothing really stood out to me. The waitress was very good in greeting us and getting our drinks. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Yaki Soba with skinny noodles. It had cabbage, carrots, chicken, and green onions. Not bad. It had a nice kick to it. Not overly spicy but probably just right. My daughter had the Chicken Yaki Soba and it was exactly like mine but without the spice. She really did like her dish and gobbled it up. As for my son and wife, they got the Raman noodle soup. It had everything in it. Cabbage, carrots, fish cake, chicken. They both thought that it was way too salty. So they didn't like it at all. This is why I was struggling on rating this place. It's really a 3 1/2 star. We got all of our food before our sushi. We got the Rainbow and Dragon rolls. I thought they were sort of small but were very good. Enjoyed them. Liked the idea of presenting the rolls on tea leaves. Nice. Overall the service was good. She kept our water glasses filled and kept on checking on us. Food was good and so so (little to salty for our liking). So since my wife and son are the Japanese food lovers, not sure if we will be back again. We'll see. Again 3 1/2 stars.
Brothers Family Restaurant=The Kind of Place You Want To Bring A Book or Newspaper to and Just Eat and RelaxThe valley is filled with places to pick up breakfast. There are the typical doughnut and bagel shops to the sit-down chain restaurants. However, once in a while, if your lucky, you come across that one neighborhood place that turns out to be a "stand-out spot".  You know what I mean, the place that everyone flocks to.  Well that place happens to be Brothers Family Restaurant!Today was my first visit to Brothers Family Restaurant and all I can say is, it won't be my last. Brothers is clean, the staff is friendly, the service is fast, the food is  very tasty, perfectly made and did I mention great prices.Brothers has one of the best family style menus around, from the countless egg dishes, to the usual breakfasts favorites, like, pancakes, French toast,  biscuits &gravy, omelettes, skillets...you name it, Brothers serves it.  Their  chorizo & green chili omelette with home style potatoes is to die for. Best Breakfast Ever! I would absolutely recommend Brothers Family Restaurant to everyone.
Fuego Steakhouse=I had never been to the Fiesta except for the movie theater when my family wanted to meet at Fuego. There were five in our party altogether, and each of us ordered something different. I ordered the Prix Fix menu for $28: Caesar salad, top sirloin with a vegetable, and creme brulee. The Caesar salad was somewhat wilted but had a good dressing. The steak was deliciously charred and it came with French beans, where the other menu items did not come with sides and had to be ordered separately. The creme brulee was a very good one, freshly torched and deliciously candied. The rest of the table all ordered steaks as well and added sides. They also ordered bacon-wrapped shrimp that they all enjoyed, but I'm neither a shrimp nor a bacon eater, so I abstained. I snuck a bite of the sweet potato, creamed spinach, and twice-baked potato, and all were delicious. The service was great as well. My one complaint is the place settings and how they seated us...we were in a circular booth with two other tables in the restaurant and we felt pretty awkward sitting at this particular table. The place settings aren't really conducive to balancing cutlery on the on the plates. A strange critique, I know, but my knife kept falling off my plate! This is a nice spot on this side of Henderson, but I don't know if I will be back because there are other places to try in town.My mother-in-law had a dining certificate here so we tried it last night. Fuego's is not what you'd expect walking through the Fiesta. The setting is very nice and laid back. We were seated at a comfy booth. It's nice to enjoy a low key steakhouse once in a while.Service was good and attentive. The bread basket was awesome (Diet? What diet? Lol) Our favorite was the croissant-like muffin that is the best bread I've had in a long time. Light flakey layers that are buttery good. There was also a pretzel bread that was fun to eat.Fuego's being a steakhouse, we ordered our favorite cut...filet mignon. First came the caesar salad which was ok and came on chilled plates but salad was a bit wilted. Our filets were tender but had temperature issues with being a level down from how we ordered it. So my well-done ended up being more of a medium well which was actually not too bad. It was served with some French green beans and our choice of complementary sauce. We tried the peppercorn...pretty good and the bernaise...not that good.Overall, a good value for good sized petite filet and green beans with a Caesar salad...$24. We would come to Fuego's for another meal.
Sea Saw=I really enjoyed Sea Saw.  We were lucky b/c we didn't have dinner reservations but we went there early and they had room for us at the bar (which was even better b/c we could watch the chef's in the kitchen).  If you have the time and the money, I'd recommend just going for the Omakase.  We went with a few a la carte dishes.  We started out w/ the Hamachi which was a beautiful slice of hamachi over a piece of grapefruit and avocado.  Tako and Tomato was next and that might have been my favorite.  They grilled the tako, put it over home-made mozzarella on top of a piece of tomato all topped w/ wasabi oil.  It was so flavorful and had a great consistency.   We then tried the Soft Shell Shrimp Fry which was ok but I didn't think that special.  We then moved on to the White Fish Carpaccio which was thinly sliced fish cooked in garlic oil.  This was very good, very unique, and surprisingly not greasy.  This dish was also served w/ some homemade bread to dip in the oil.  I think I could have kept eating everything on the menu but we moved onto dessert which was a great ending.  I tried the tofu chocolate dessert which was very good and very thick.  I was lucky enough to try the banana dessert as well which, even if you don't like banana desserts... you should try because it was that good.  When you go, don't forget to try the mixed drinks... I'd recommend the sparkling sake one.  If you're in the mood for wine though, they have an amazing wine list.Overall, I thought it was a great experience.Nobu's food doesn't challenge you, it thrills you. You already know about the accolades and awards that extend far beyond this valley. So let's get down to the do's and dont's.Do:  - sit at the counter, at least half the time.  - beg for oxtail stew. get on the "oxtail stew call list". if they run out, find and kill an ox. chop off his butt.  - say yes to the little, live, flash-fried river crabs.  - try the omakase menu at least once.  - order a bottle of the Jozen Mizu No Gotoshi sake. it's floral and dry and perfect. (we mow through 2 or 3, but we're drunks)  - order the white fish carpaccio. garlic has waited 1000s of years for this dish to be created.  - be nice to Chantal. she is a cool chick.  - marvel at how skinny Jeff the Chef is.  - work harder to make more money to come back to sea saw.Don't:  - come here for sushi rolls.  - tell your party that it's "right up there with Stingray".  - bring someone who wants sake bombers.  - bring a large group. it's optimized for couples and small groups.  - be allergic to anything, cuz god knows what's in there.  - look at the prices. ever. when the check comes, cover the top with your other hand and just sign. tell chantal to add the tip in.  - be afraid to ask the chefs what they're doing and why. learn.Rarely is innovative food so comforting. We always leave happy and less wealthy. If a place can consistently do that for you and keep you coming back, it's onto something.
Rosita's Fine Mexican Food=What was that freaking smell? Holy crap. Smelled like a dirty diaper wrapped in farts. Permeated the entire restaurant. Sure didn't do much to make the greasy over-priced food any more appetizing, I'll tell you that. Thought maybe it was a one-time thing, but after a quick scan of a couple previous reviews, it seems to be a recurring theme with this place. Yuck.
Mimi's Cafe=What happens when a Croatian family, 2 gays and a brood of CenPho peeps head to the westside for a birthday brunch at...*gasp*...a chain restaurant. Well, I'll tell ya what happens. Big Fun. That's what! We had at least 20 people and took over an entire room in back. That was smart of them as we were a "lively" group. Granted it took quite a while to get drinks out to us, but I'm a restaurant person and forgive easier than others. We had strawberry mimosas served with a split of Freixenet. Fantastic! I had the cordon blue crepes with ham, Swiss, onion and eggs topped with Dijon cream sauce...seriously...they were heavenly. I was last to be served so I was nervous my crepes would be petrified. They were piping hot! Also on my plate were fresh grapes. They were chilled & snappy. Kind of like Angelina Joilie's personality. I have to say the place was pretty messy, including the restroom, which oddly smelled like the men's restroom at the Esplanade. I'll remember you Mimi. Next year, when I'm visiting the westside again, I may swing by for those crepes. Oh. One weird thing happened. After a few of us had ordered our third strawberry mimosa, we were told they had no more champagne left. Really? Cuz it feels like you're cutting us off! Whatev! We had consumed plenty but got a chuckle out of being cut off in a room full of coffee swilling seniors!
Hing Loon Chinese Ex=Hung a Loon is what is should be called! I tried this place when I bought my house I was moving, tired, and hungry an interesting little man came to the door. He was carring with him a menu to the Hing Loon. It had pretty pictures of the fabulous feast that would await. I asked about the food and was assured it was delicious. So I proceeded to call and speak to a woman who did not understand English very well (not uncommon for a mom and pop Chinese joint). After repeating my order several times and feeling confident that she had it down. I sat back and waited for Beef chop suey, Teriyaki chicken, an egg roll and free crab puffs the special on the menu to be delivered. 45 minutes later it arrived and smelled great. I figured since I live 1/2 a mile from this place that 45 minutes could mean they are very busy or just very slow. After tasting the food I believe it was the latter of the two. 1st both dishes were swimming in sauce almost like soup. The chop suey touted brown oyster sauce it was white and it frightened me a little. I took the first bite and could not allow my stomach to be subjected to this kind of crime. I promptly spit it into my napkin. The teriyaki chicken was very fatty and had a funny taste it was rubbery like that of an old bird. Egg roll I think not grease stick! My favorite was crab puffs! You bite in and get a puff of air not the creamy cheese and Crab as intended for a crab puff to be. Don't do it! For the love of god and all that is holy I beg you! Do not punish your taste buds with this garbage served in cute Togo containers!
Krung Thai Restaurant=Seriously...i love spicy food especially thai food but... The break down:FOOD QUALITY:   pretty good 4 out of 5PRICE:  Too expensive for the portions, they even force you to buy bottled water! The bottles are SOO tiny, and can you imagine not having enough water when you eat spicy foods??SERVICE:  OMG...the owner sings on certain nights and makes himself a rockstar?? One of the waitresses were kind of rude to us because one of my friends asked if the portions have changed...lol.  They also try to "up sell" everything on their menu, always coming around to ask us to try this and that....We felt like we were being hustled and all we wanted was to eat dinner...Originally me and the wifey were gonna go to Blueberry Hill since we have never been there. This place just happens to be right next to it. Since my wife loves Thai food and we have never been to Krung Thai, it was a no brainer.Came in on Thursday night at 8:30. They close at 11 so we had plenty of time to order and eat. Was greeted and sat down right away. There were only a couple other tables occupied so im assuming the dinner rush has already come and gone.We order our favorites. Deep Fried Tofu, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Shrimp Pad See Ew. The deep fried tofu was good as expected. Golden and crispy with a side of a sweet n sour type of sauce. The Pineapple Fried Rice was just ok. It didn't have the abundance of pineapple chunks like im used to. You would think that with the name of the dish that pineapple chunks would be all over the place. I think there was only about 6 pieces?As for the Shrimp Pad See Ew. Ironically the ew part of it was real. As I moved the dish closer to my plate I can smell the distinct odor of raw shrimp. Like it wasnt cooked all the way enough. At first I thought I was imagining it but once I started eating it all I could taste was something close to like raw shrimp on the verge of spoiling. My wife had the same reaction. It was at this point that we requested another order of Pad See Ew but with beef instead. I had to get a new plate because the odor was lingering on it. After about 5 minutes we receive our new dish. As soon as I took one bite I can faintly taste the same thing just like the last dish. At this point I was thinking maybe they cooked the food in the same wok with out washing it? Why else would the raw shrimp taste still be there?By this point me and the wifey just ended up finishing the Pineapple Fried Rice and Fried Tofu. We ended up boxing the Pad See Ew. Why I don't know. Maybe we will try it again later to see if it was just us? Umm....nope, still tasted nasty. I know what you guys are thinking. Send it back? Take it off the bill? No, we are not the type of people to keep complaining especially if we gave you a second chance already.This does not take away from the service which was good. Our server was there for refills and redoing our second order, etc.In closing, I don't think we will be coming back here any time soon. Maybe we just caught them on an off night. Hopefully the next visit if there is one, it will be better and I can update this review accordingly.Yelp 2015 review #5 "Lets get Krung? Nope not here!"504 overall
KFC=Maybe it's me, but I've had the worst luck with customer service at EVERY KFC I go to.. Hawaii was a joke, but I can't figure out what location it was to write a review! Anyways, this KFC is probably the next worst with customer service. This little brunette woman was the worst! I had to repeat my order like 5 times and I could hear her laughing and talking with another employee through the speaker so she kept having to ask me "what was that?" with a rude attitude. I finally pulled up to the window to place my order face to face. She then went to repeat my order that I just told her, and things were still wrong! Seriously?! At least my finally correct order was edible. 1 star for service and 2 stars for the food.. #blah
Elements=Marcus seemed to cover pretty much everything in his review of Elements and their recent transformation...  I'd just like to say "ditto" to everything he said since I was finally blessed with the opportunity to experience a meal at this Valley gem... and in case you were wondering, it was worth the long wait!A few things that Marcus did not mention:- the (complimentary) buddha bread and eggplant dip; a nice little starter to whet our appetites- the side order of shishito peppers that we ordered as a starter - delicious with just the right amount of kick- the pork belly fried rice (I didn't have any but Jared loved it!)- the sautéed mushrooms (why don't my sautéed mushrooms come out this good?)And just to go into a bit more detail: I ordered the Arctic Char entrée and J went with the Duck Breast... both were prepared perfectly.  Elements touts itself as serving "farm-fresh American cuisine with Asian accents, including sustainable seafood and the best local produce."  I love the Asian accents and everything we at was extremely high quality... the attentive service from Mark and staff included.We agreed on one dessert for the table; we told Mark to surprise us between the cracker jack soup and the bamboo torte... and bamboo torte it was.  I floated home after my experience at Elements... fine wine, exquisite food, attentive service, beautiful views, awesome ambiance, and incredible company - what more can you ask for?Was invited to have dinner with some friends.  Located at the Sanctuary Resort, this elegant restaurant provided an awesome dining experience!  The decor is very modern and the service was excellent!  Now, on to the food....I ordered:Local Organic Greens (Chinese Long Beans, Toasted Nori, Soy Sesame Vinaigrette, $10)Pan Roasted Free Range Chicken (Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Chinese Broccoli, Lemongrass Pan Jus, $28)Glass of Orin Swift "Prisoner" Red Blend Zinfandel (Napa, $17)The Organic Greens were very tasty.  The Soy Sesame Vinaigrette was tangy and went very well with the Greens.  The Chicken was amazing, so tasty and juicy!Overall, it was a great night.....good food and good times!Return Factor - 100%It has been a while since we've dined at Elements, so we decided to drop in for dinner last week.  It was 6:30 pm on a Thursday and we were able to get seated immediately with no reservation.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:Bottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, $50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-g#H0EVCkIUGi99mUMFWJhn-gIced Shellfish Platter, $36http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVsw#hNpp4h_HpdQQeEItypxVswhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5Q#7A1cAyB1n_CGFibC94nO5QWedge Salad, $14http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3g#ZLZ80iAimkaw6DvsKzP-3gPepper Encrusted Filet, $44http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAg#gyhoMxTOhxyW0rpzv4tlAgHudson Valley Foie Gras, $24http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5Cfw#VBVpkMDbAofUXa9PBU5CfwIrish car bomb, $11http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8Q#BTMQF5GK_IDSaphESOST8QS'mores $11http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elements-paradise-valley?select=BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkw#BIkjxuFzsIJUT4_TMQikkwLadgate 20 yr Tawny Port, $14For starters, the Better Half had the Shellfish Platter and was very pleased with it.  It's not as large of a portion as it sounds, but it can be shared between 2 or 3 people.  I had the Wedge Salad, which was too sweet and "soggy" for my tastes.  As you can see in my photo, the Salad had dressing on the bottom of the Salad and was also topped with Pickled Onion, Tomato, and Avocado....it was missing that "crisp crunch" that I love about Wedges.  I won't order it again.For the main course, TBH had the Foie Gras, which she devoured....she loved it.  I had the Pepper Encrusted Filet which was also awesome and cooked perfectly just a shade above Medium.  The Filet was full of flavor and the portion was just right.  To compliment our entree's we had a bottle of 2011 Edge Cabernet, which hit the spot.For dessert, we had the Irish Car Bomb and the S'mores....the Irish Car Bomb was awesome.  The S'mores was good too, but very rich and we couldn't finish it.  They have a nice selection of after dinner drinks, so I had a glass of Ladgate 20 yr Tawny Port to go with dessert.The wait staff is very attentive here and gave us impeccable service throughout dinner.  That's one of the reasons why we love this place.Return Factor - 100%
Jack in the Box=This is one of the better jack locations I've been to. Sometimes the drive thru can be long but it moves quick. I get coupons in the mail so I use them most of the time and they take them with no problem. One of the best things Jack ever did was invent the munchie meal. It starts after 9 pm and changes but right now it's $6 for a hella-peno burger, 2 tacos and a mix of regular fries as well curly fries. The burger has jalapeños on it but also stuffed jalapeños and taco sauce. Damn it's hella good! Not that I expected much but I wasn't crazy about their mini pancakes. I'll stick to the ultimate sausage sandwich for breakfast instead.
The Horny Toad=OK... I'm not some elitist snob that only dines out in 5 star establishments and though I do have an educated palate, I'm also a realist when it comes to the type of place where I'm dining. That said... I accept that I'm now going to be known as the "Official Curmudgeon" of yelp... but I can't help but believe in the concept of service and quality in exchange for fair compensation. Unfortunately, it's a totally unknown (or ignored) concept here. Come on! Really? FIVE BUCKS for a Corona?? This is AZ people, not NYC! Combined with the "famous" ribs that seriously would NOT place in my top FIFTY and a sour faced waitress that clearly didn't give a s*#& if we were happy, this has to top our list of dining ripoffs. You could offer me 500 bucks to eat here and I'd pick the cafeteria at my old high school instead! If this place were anywhere but Cave Creek where people obviously have money to piss away, they wouldn't survive. Wish I could rate 0 stars.
Papa John's Pizza=Call this pizza for getting yourself the best insult in the city. Order the pizza they will promise delivery in 30 minutes, call to verify your order they will say it takes 1.5 hrs to reach for the delivery, and you would be asked to cancel if you want to know the status. Have respect and eat with some sense in this great city.
Takamatsu Of Chandler=Takamatsu is my kind of place.  I've been going here (Also the one in Glendale on Dunlap) for about 8 years, so you know it must be good.  This place is GREAT for groups.  You can grill your own food right at your table, or have one of the staff members do it for you.  With your dish, comes a variety of tiny sides (Im sure there is a Korean name for these.  If someone knows, please... do tell.)  The sides are all vegetables such as spiced potatoes, cabbage, bean curd paste, and kimchee.  I stay away from the Kimchee unless it is the spicy red variety.  To me most kimchee smells like garbage.The sushi is decent but not the best, and they have an assortment of sake for you to try.  Bottom line? If you like Korean Barbeque, I guarantee you'll like it. But, if you don't, don't take my guarantee seriously.**Afterthought**Don't let the "less than good" reviews about their sushi drive you away.  It is decent.  However, if you aren't coming here for the awesome Korean BBQ, go somewhere else.Meh. I was really looking forward to trying out Takamatsu. After all, it is right up the street from our house. Dude and I joined Sarah R. and a large group (15-20, I think, many dropped in and out) here for her Sendoff Dinner.Yes, the quality service tends to decline when larger groups are present. But what we experienced was downright unacceptable.Really rude server. Mumbled and spoke too quietly and we seemed like a giant inconvenience to her. Brought rolls to our table that belonged to no one in our party, and got visibly peeved (eye rolling, dirty looks, etc.) when one of us told her politely it wasn't ours.Good luck getting water or utensils. Dude and I ended up just sharing a glass. Trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare. Another server approached our party and asked Dude and I if some rolls were ours. They need a better way to keep track of tickets. Got to the point we walked up to the cashier, told him what we ordered and paid.Also, another server on Sarah's end of the table got frustrated with a new guest to our party and RIPPED UP his sushi ordering sheet. In front of customers ... And was that really necessary? We probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a Korean BBQ joint. But hey, sounded tasty! Tried the Las Vegas, Tiger, Rainbow and Heart Attack Rolls. Everything tasted the same. Way too much rice, thinly cut fish (to the point it looked like just the skins), and the breading on the Vegas Roll was bready and soggy. Like it had been sitting out a long time. And don't even get me started on the culinary clusterphuk that was that Heart Attack Roll. Come on: Eel sauce + spicy cheese sauce + cream cheese + jalapeno pepper does not equal a palate pleaser.I did; however, get to taste a piece of Sarah's spicy pork dish ... That was excellent!The bright side to this place? We had a wonderful time enjoying the company of our friends, and Takamatsu was OK with me bringing a cake for Sarah.Despite the dismal experience, I wanted to come back and try the Korean BBQ. That is, until Dude got an epic case of food poisoning. Going on day two. And we're talking about a guy that almost never gets sick. Can count on one hand after nearly 9 years together how many times he's been sick.Not worth $8.95/roll; sure as hell wasn't worth an 18% gratuity charge. I'll stick to Shimogamo for delicious sushi that matches the price, and will be on the hunt for another Korean BBQ place. Spare your digestive tract and avoid the sushi. Stick to BBQ if you go.It was in the early 2000's when I had my first taste of Korean barbecue.  It was at the Takamatsu down in Phoenix and I thought it was the greatest thing ever to be able to get Japanese food along with your Korean grilled meats.  Wow!  Since those innocent times, the Phoenix area has grown greatly in the food scene and I have seen the light.I've long ruled out Takamatsu to get my Korean eats but I must admit, it's been a minute since I've had their sushi and on an invite to test out their AYCE sushi tonight, I figured it was worth a try and another visit.  What a mistake.  I wish I can take back my $23.99 and go elsewhere.  The fish isn't fresh, the cuts are uneven, and there's just entirely too much filler rice.  I get that it's AYCE but never have I experienced a place that would justify adding hella rice and barely any goods.  There was also way too much vinegar in the rice and the acidity made my stomach unhappy.  Don't get me started on how oily the Las Vegas roll was.The service was pretty non-existent on top of the sub-par food.  There were at least three servers and only ten tables.  Most people were grilling so it's not like they needed much attention.  We were the only ones doing AYCE and it seemed like the servers were going out of their way to avoid eye contact and collecting our order sheet.  Since we were getting plates upon plates for our orders, we had a small mountain of dishes building which we stacked nicely and no one to collect them.  It's a small thing but I wish they whisked them away.Anywho, never again, Takamatsu.  We had a good run in those good old innocent and naive days but with all the competition out there, y'all just can't keep up.  Peace.
Kiss the Cook Restaurant=Great little spot in Glendale!If you hadn't noticed, the West side (make that all sides...) is a strip mall wonderland.  When I got to Kiss the Cook, I was pleasantly pleased to see that it was a free standing building (guess I'm easily impressed) with plenty of parking and even a cute patio!The menu was full of typical breakfast favorites including omelets, pancakes, and hearty breakfast indulgences.  5-star service!  Our coffee was never low and our water glasses were always replenished.  The decor inside was similar to my Michigan grandma's basement which made everything seem extremely relaxed.  As other Yelpers noted, the muffin basket is a highlight.  Once you order you are greeted with a little warm basket with several different types of miniature muffins of love.  mmmI love that when you get your bill (cheap too by the way!), you are greeted with a real Hershey's kiss!  These are the touches that are always forgotten with chain restaurantsI know I will return-totally worth a try if you are on this side of townKiss the Cook is stellar in some ways and just misses the mark on others, which in my book rates it a solid four stars. I have been eating here since high-school and find this little family owned restaurant charming.In addition to their regular menu (you can order breakfast or lunch any time), they always have three or four lovely specials. Generally, one is any omnivores dream, one takes fruit to a whole new level, and the other features one of their baked products done up to the nines.My personal favorite is the "build your own" omelet. The ingredients are all super fresh, the omelet is always stuffed, and the house potatoes that are served on the side are very yummy (although I would like them done a little more on the crunchy side). My sisters favorite is the Snow Pea omelet. She swears it is the perfect combination of crunch and fluff!Each meal starts out with a little basket of mini-muffin heaven. Alas the mini biscuits are no longer served, but man oh man are those zucchini muffins out of this world.So you may be wondering, after all these raves, what are the down sides... well on occasion there is a little more butter on the bottom of the plate than I am comfortable with and although they are supposed to be famous, their sticky buns aren't all that special.If you are looking for decent food, served with a smile, in a unique environment - you will definitely enjoy your visit to Kiss the Cook. Oh and there is that little chocolate kiss that leaves you wanting more...  : )03/19/10Kitschy, fun country-life decor.  There was about a 15-minute waiting time.  Lots of older citizens waiting, which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women.  It's refreshing when a restaurant's setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers-- Mom and I encounter so many "closed" individuals on a daily basis at work, so this is a nice change of pace for us.  Staff here seem friendly and busy, but efficient.  At least, ours was.  One complaint: it's a bit cramped in here.  It would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables, especially when I spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops, and only one was occupied.Can't recall what Mom ordered, but I wasn't surprised that she didn't enjoy it-- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me.  Website does not list a menu, and all I can recall is that it was an omelet w/ a couple of fibrous veggies (snow peas and something else; it was a strange combo, of that I'm sure of.  Chestnuts, maybe?).  I went w/ a Belgian waffle, two eggs, and bacon.  Coffee was weak, but our server offered to brew a stronger pot.  Nice!  While we waited for our selections, she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy, and that we did!  We both really liked the bran.  I also enjoyed the zucchini-- Mom thought she detected cinnamon (not a fave of hers), but I think it's the nutmeg she was referring to.  Then again, I may be mistaken...Waffle was, well, a waffle.  No accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up.  I always bring my own 100% organic maple syrup, because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup, it isn't 100% pure, but a blend of maple and corn syrups.  (If it smells like Mrs. Butterworth's, it isn't 100% maple.  Just sayin'.)  Eggs were cooked to over-medium, just that way I like 'em.  Bacon was very nice.Cute saucer and dinner plates, lovely mini-muffins (we bought extra to-go!), good bacon, and efficient service make for a solid two stars.  I wouldn't mind giving KTC another try, if we're in the area.  Next time we'll try the pancakes and crepes!I have now been here 3 times.  This place is sort of an icon in Glendale and I had been hearing that I had to go here since I moved here 17 years ago.The first time I was here was Mothers Day. and I ordered the special breakfast of chicken crepes with a fruit bowl.  It was cold, the spinach had the texture of shoe leather, the Alfredo sauce had separated then formed a skin.  The fruit bowl it came with was ok as was the coffee and the mini muffins with butter were really good.'The next time I went for lunch and had that day's special which was a  hot turkey sandwich with potato salad.  The sandwich was ok. The potato salad was bland but the seasoned salt on the table made it ok. This last time I had the Cooks breakfast of two pancakes, two eggs, two sausages (or bacon) and I added some potatoes.  The breakfast was lukewarm.  The pancakes and potatoes were pretty good, the eggs and sausage were just ok.  As noted before the mini muffins served with real butter were really good.Ever body I encountered was pleasant.  The place is looking a bit worn.  When I was there the place was one to two thirds full.  I noticed this last trip the line of chairs and the coffee station outside were missing.  I fully understand that the banter between the waitresses and the regular customers is one of the things that brings people back, I just wish it didn't cause my food to be served lukewarm as I saw other plates served that were still steaming.I gave it a 3 but it is a pretty weak 3 and although I would go there again if somebody else picked it I doubt it will make it into my regular rotation.The garden benedict was definitely delicious. Probably my favorite dish here in Kiss the Cook. Not only the food is great here, the place is nice and the service is great as well. The atmosphere is nice too.After all these years, I finally came and tried this establishment.  The parking spaces were limited.  Watch where you park!   A long line was already out the door waiting for a table. Why are brunch places always so busy?  The decor reminded me of Glendale's antique shops. They have a bunch of baskets hanging and other random items surrounded the restaurant. Its interesting decor. Upon entering the restaurant, there was a strong burnt odor in the dining area.  I'm assuming their vents weren't working. I had the Country Breakfast with 2 eggs, biscuits & gravy, and fried potatoes. The biscuits & gravy didn't taste fresh and homemade. Fried potatoes were basically scorched.  They were tasteless and hard.  It helped when you sprinkle with plenty of black peppers.The staff was efficient and friendly.  I love a place still give out free warm muffins. I would return just to order the basket of muffins. It was absolutely delicious.
Alberto Italian Restaurant=It's nice when Plan B turns out better than Plan A would have been had it not failed so miserably.  Thanks to Yelp, we did not leave Cave Creek hungry (then again, we never leave anywhere hungry), but we did leave happy.I love the homey feeling this little gem offers.  Alberto himself greets his guests, takes orders, and serves us as if we are family.  Well, maybe not my family, but someone else's much warmer and friendlier family.We quickly devoured the fresh bread and dipping oil, moving on to delicious Caesar salads.  How I love a well-dressed salad.  After seeing one too many episodes of Hell's Kitchen, my husband opted for risotto.  No need to settle on what's offered on the menu, as they will prepare it any way you'd like.  Alberto suggested a seafood risotto with a spicy tomato sauce.  This was perfection with ample shrimp, lobster, scallops and mussels.  The tomato sauce was spicy, but not overpowering.  Alberto does offer one hand-made pasta, fettucini.  I opted for a simple dish of this pasta with fresh tomato and garlic.  The fettucini was perfect, but I found the dish a tad salty and the thickly sliced garlic was not cooked enough IMHO.  I enjoyed the meal, but the risotto was really the star of this show.For dessert, we shared a tart with fig jam.  Alberto's jams are hand-made as well.  Needless to say it was a mistake to share this dessert.  I wanted my own and will have it next time.  And there will be a next time.
Dairy Queen=I could have had gelato. The G-Spot is also on the way home. I could have had a lot of other things but I was just too lazy to get out of the car.The Beautiful Carin and I were on our way home last night. We attended the terrific Yelp event at La Bocca. I grabbed a biscotto (singular for biscotti) on the way out (delightful...crispy and chocolaty with sweet anise finish) and I really should have been satisfied with that, but Noooooooo! I had to have something else. That turned out to be DQ on Scottsdale Road. If you happen to be going north on Scottsdale Road, you can't successfully "drive through" this DQ unless you successfully "jump the median curb" and "avoid a head on collision"...all possible with all wheel drive, so I was good to go on that front, however, I arrived at the speaker to place my order in a slightly less relaxed state than I had anticipated. So I was less inclined to be forgiving when I ordered a waffle cone and heard my confirmation come back as "&&^&*^~%^^%%$@~%&@%*~^(&(@&(~@^~*^@^@^~*@^". It could have been that they were saying "yes sir, we will have that cone ready for you at the window", but we'll never know.Got my cone ($2.50), and it was already drippy...I know, I know, it's soft serve (that's what she said:), but still, I expect it to maintain a somewhat frosty and cohesive state, and wait until I get out of the drive through before it falls on  my lap. But, I suppose it tasted OK (the part I got to eat instead of wear).So, dripping cone in hand, we now get to try to successfully leave the drive through at DQ and return to our northbound heading...good luck! We were again fortunate that we have all wheel drive, because the driveway is steep enough to be labeled "curb" in most jurisdictions. We bounced out into traffic and now needed to make it across 3 lanes of southbound traffic, make a u-turn across the median and negotiate the northbound traffic flow...with one hand!I was saved by 2 things:I spent part of my youth rodeo-ing (bareback bronc's) and I spent a considerably longer time racing (sports and formula cars). So, even with reflexes and visual acuity dulled by age, I was able to safely negotiate all of the hazards encountered trying to "drive through" DQ.I could have had a cookie.The ice cream stains came right out:)Dairy Queen and their blizzards are obviously amazing, but this review is going to go much deeper than this. This review is going to talk about their blizzard ice cream cakes. Yes you read that right. Blizzard ice cream cakes! For my husband's recent birthday, I opted for his annual ice cream birthday cake but this year, we live in a different area which means the Baskin Robbins ice cream cake wasn't going to cut it. I had heard about the Dairy Queen ice cream cakes, so I decided to give it a try. Blizzard cakes take 48 hours prep time because they are made to order, but I promise you it is worth the weight! I ordered the peanut butter cup blizzard cake. The verdict? My husband was thrilled and so was I! The cake was the perfect combination of ice cream, blizzard mixture, peanut butter cups and fudge cake. If you need a cake for a special occasion, remember that Dairy Queen offers much more than just drive through frozen treats. They also sell delicious cakes!
Wing Hing=Pretty darn impressed. The interior is old, drab and clean! The food is hot, yummy and great. Do not let the exterior fool you this is legit food. We had Sun devil Chicken....spicey Chicken fried Rice... perfect Steamed dumpling.. i swear they are homemade Sesame chicken... great flavor and nice chicken, not shitty stuff here. The service is amazing, they packed all the food into a box, taped it all down so it didn't move and gave all the extras you need to enjoy a nice take out. Way to go Tam!
El Taco Feliz=Fresh Mex Open 24hour + free deliveryUnbelievably inexpensive and pretty tasty! What more could you ask for if you're up playing poker online?! The fish tacos were delicious, ended up getting a combo. Unfortunately you'll need to add lime and salt to their guacamole it has very little flavor, and don't forget to ask for hot salsa - the house salsa is pretty mild.Date Rating: N/A (still haven't been to the actual location)Pick up Scale: N/A (I'm sure you can meet interesting locals here late night)Strong Suggestion: Order from here when you're starving.Unfortunately this review is downgraded to a 3 star rating. Time for an update since I have been back a few times after my last visit. As mentioned before their original dba was El Taco Fresco. Everything is the same however I think they have trimmed the portion size of their food and increased prices a bit.I often place my order then walk through the adjoining door to Money Plays bar and grab a beer and wait for my food which they will walk over to me when ready. Mexican food and an ice cold beer is a very nice combination in my book and I am not much of a beer drinker.We ordered rolled tacos, excuse me I mean taquitos as they call them. In San Diego, CA where I am from the old school taco shops call them rolled tacos as they really are. I never heard of the term "taquitos" until I moved to Los Angeles. Anyhow, of course don't forget the cheese and guacamole. Well just don't expect much cheese or guacamole as the amount was laughable and yes they charge extra for guacamole in which they are very stingy with. Only two out of my five taquitos had enough guacamole to enjoy. A pet peeve of mine is if you charge extra for it then make sure you give a fair amount. They were tighter than a ticks as with the guacamole!I was craving carne asada so I got a burrito this visit. I was disappointed in the size as it was very small and not very meaty. If I order a carne asada burrito I want to taste a decent amount of meat. This burrito was the smallest and least filled I have ever had the opportunity to consume.  It did not even look right, it was so small and empty the shape was not even of a burrito but rather more similar to the shape of a pear. I was very disappointed, thank goodness I split an order of "taquitos" with my sweetie or I would have left just as hungry as when I walked in.I will give them some time and check back as I am turned off at the moment. :(The name change in my opinion has only brought higher prices and less food.**NOT A DRUNK REVIEW** LOL.Yes, this place is next to a bar. I come to eat here first AND THEN get hammered. So I seriously remember what I've eaten here before. LOL.I've ordered a bunch of food here before. Carne asada tacos, chicken nachos, carnitas burritos, burgers & fries, and chicken tenders. Yup, they're all good.Service is excellent. If you tell the guy that you're at the bar, they will bring your food to you. Would come back here...hammered. LOL
Lou's Diner=Over the last couple months I've been bouncing back and forth between the recently purchased new abode and the old house that's currently in escrow.  Numerous meetings with contractors at the new place, back to the old place to meet realtors, contractors, inspectors, blah blah blah.  A few weeks back I decided every time I have to be at the new place to meet a contractor, after the meeting i'll hit a breakfast place.It's been ages since I've been to Lou's so I decided to include it on my breakfast place list.Place looks exactly like it did when I tried it over 4 years ago.  I believe the cook was the same ( is it Lou ? ) Ordered ham steak, eggs o/e, rye toast.  I believe it was $8.  I expected a lower price given low rent district, presumably low overhead given nothing has changed in the place in over 4 years, so maybe the serving size is ala hash house a go go , uhhhhh, that's a negatoryFood was average - a little too much oil puddling on the eggs but not a big deal given the grease in the hash browns.Probably closer to 2.5 stars but I round up given the place for so dang long - props to them.
El Tlacoyo=El Tiacoyo is not your usual Mexican Restaurant. It's Hidalgo Regional Cuisine. That means you can order things like cow foot tacos, cactus soup, head meat tacos, sausage and intestine tacos, huitiacoche cheese crisp, barbacoa, mixotes and so much more!They have weekend specials this past weekend it was lamb tacos but on past visits I saw goat and brain tacos.They start you off with chips and a creamy green very spicy sauce thats very good and a smokey red sauce that's also good and less spicy. We got the huitiacoche  (also known as corn smut or Mexican Truffle) cheese crisp. It's not the Americanized watered down version it's the real stuff. Very earthy and interesting. From what I tried so far from here I've found that they do very good fish dishes here very reasonably priced. They don't use that cheap tilapia or muddy tasting swai fish like other places use. From the two fish dishes I tasted it seems like a very fresh sweet snapper kind of fish. This time I tried what they called grilled fish. When I saw it I thought they gave me the wrong thing because I received an aluminum envelope filled with very moist very fresh tasting fish cooked in juices from tomato and onions and a little butter. By looking at the envelope I think they cooked it on the grill. This dish came with average rice and beans and tortillas. My husband tried the chicken enchiladas, They were made with very fresh tasting chicken and were or mostly were just filled with chicken. The green chili sauce that topped them was very heavy with lime juice.I should mention that this place is not fancy and is very raw looking so you only come here for the food and not the ambiance. It's also hard to see from the street because it's located behind another building.4.5 stars I didn't round up to 5 because of the average rice and beans and lack of atmosphere
P.F. Chang's=OK. Reviewing PF Changs in Phoenix is like reviewing Delux, Barrio Cafe or some other overly reviewed although perhaps well deserving place. That long incorrectly worded sentence aside, I have to say, we had a fantastic Chang experience. Mostly due to the fact that we were buzzed after the fabulously thrown Gabi yelp event. And we didn't choose to wait for a table, yet sat at the bar, with the other drinkers. We quickly made friends with the bar staff, and diners on either side of us. The spring rolls were crisp, hot and well, kinda bland. Thank you sides o sauce. The mushu pork was dee lish as was the Spicy Chang Chicken. However, riding the bland wagon, was the chicken fried rice. Undercooked and totally void of flavor. The sake was hot, just like the electronics were our diners to the left were hawking. Seriously. He went to his car to retrieve things. Thanks. But no thanks. Service was outstanding. Energy in the restaurant was fun. Unusual for me to give 4 stars to a chain restaurant, unless there's and in and an out in the name. But here goes for tonight. Four stars PF. Four stars! More on service and ambiance than food. But four stars nonetheless!I figured it was time for an update for this local (yes, local!) restaurant. Did you know that PF Chang's started in Arizona and in fact, this location is the flag ship restaurant for all the Chang's. That means this restaurant will have updates and changes to the menu before anyone else. This is a good option if you're looking for a decent meal with good service. You know what you're getting here because they have their concept perfected. We recently dined here and had Chas as our waiter. Chas is also a trainer and was not only very knowledgeable but also friendly and suggested tweaks to our food that made it even better. When you dine here, ask to sit in Chas' section!I love and adore the chicken fried rice, but I could make sweet love all-night-long to the northern-style ribs.  How does one make love to ribs?  XXX is how.  Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.Order "off the menu":-- The "real" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good.-- The "Stir-fried Eggplant" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!I took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.No matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.=======================Location specific - Scottsdale=======================1.  Big location, lots of seating, and great outdoor area.2.  Late night happy hour - yay!  When the temp of the nights in AZ are in the 70's --- sitting outside is supreme3.  Yelp check-in offer, free order of dim sum - edamame potstickers (yum!)
Koji Sushi Bar and China Bistro=On my recent trip back to Vegas we had the opportunity to try Koji out while we were at The Orleans Casino for the first time.  Generally we would just be here for the Orlean's buffet but since we were sort of buffet out we decided to give this place a try.  It actualy pleasantly surprised our party!First of all, we were here little before noon so the place was only occupied by 3 tables...  Then as time passes by, a good amount of crowd actually were building up so I'm glad to see that happen with any restaurant large or small.Checked the prices out and it was slightly steeper than what I was hoping but with the craving for sushi we decided to give it a try...Here is what we've ordered...Who's your daddy roll:  Totally delicious!  Yes it was more expensive than other places but man it sure was good.  Delicious tempura shrimp & I believe avocado wrapped in sushi rice topped with sashimi with sauce... so delicious!  I think I can just get this only next time around!  Tried a couple of dishes on the menu too! (aside from the sushi)  It was actually really good!--Braised Pork Belly with Chinese Mustard Greens:  So bomb!  The pork belly were so tender, soft, and perfectly simmered in a soy sauce based soup that is actually not overly salty.  (If I only had some BAOs with me this would of so made my day!)  The portion of these pork belly were huge too!  Easily 8 slices of 1/2" of porky joy!  I can still conjure the image of how it was melting in my mouth!  WOW!--Steamed Tofu in lotus leaves with shaved Scallops:  Another awesome one!  The tofu itself was light, airy, fluffy, and hot!  The sauce that goes on top of the freshly steamed tofu was just the rigth balance of flavor once again with the melody of mushrooms + shaved scallops... what a perfect balance to the pork bellies!!!--Pan fried beef noodles:  You know, this dish is actually quite good but I'm not a pan fried noodle type of guy (I don't like it anywhere but others love it so I just have to deal with it)  It was tasty but just not my type of dish to enjoy.Service was attentive and effective.  No problems here!So after finally tasting Koji for the first time after so many trips to Orleans would I go back?  Yes!  Who's Your Daddy + Pork Belly truly got me hooked!  Unfortunately it is a casino environment and cost will be much higher than say at Chinatown area, but if you are doing your gambling here at The Orleans, I would definitely recommend you give this place a try!(P.S.  Pork Belly I believe it's a special that comes and goes... so if you are into juicy, tender, and absolutely pork belly cuts, you better get some now!)
Buffalo Wild Wings=Another chain I have visited recently.  Good place to catch Red Sox games if you don't have an MLB package with your cable or Direct TV.  If you need to take proactive steps in order to consume a food is that good?  I really like the habanero mango sauce.  On Thursdays they have .60 chicken fingers (boneless wings) and I have gone a couple times and had them with the habanero sauce.Problem is the sauce is very hot.  Spicy hot.  When you eat it.  As it works it's way through your system.  As it works it's way out of your system.  Spicy.If you order wings ask for them crispy.  They will cook them a little more and give them the nice crunchiness just like at home.Other than wings and boneless and beer Buffalo Wild Wings is probably a two star joint.
Rusty Spur Saloon=Scottsdale's Last Real Cowboy Saloon... I totally thought I'd reviewed Rusty Spur before as I've been more times than I can count.  I'll agree with most of the positive reviews already written about this place - it's laid back, un-pretentious, hole-in-the-wall, and fun!I'm not a huge country music fan either, but when I come to Rusty Spur, I love it!  You can't help but smile and have a great time at this place!  If I don't start out here at Happy Hour, I end the night here whenever I'm out in Old Town.  I'm left with a souvenir tank top that Jared bought me in his drunken state the other night when we were hanging at the Spur.  It says:ALL JACKED UPBig TimeSince 1951RUSTY SPUR SALOONScottsdale, AZIt's cute, but not quite as wonderful as entering into the doors of the Rusty Spur and leaving your troubles behind to enjoy the country music and cowboys that surround you!After the Elite event at Iruna, my Yelp posse; Dante Dolores Anna Mike and I (name drop!!) decided to chase the evening with mas cervezas, at a place Dante lovingly referred to as "The Rusty Trombone". We stumbled to the western theme bar with two birds i'd been chatting up in toe, whose boring names escape me. As we made our approach we could hear a lone singer/guitarist gilr crooning away to Fleetwood Mac and as my mates snickered a smile formed across my lips as I nostalgically thought of my Mum. We settled ourselves at a table and got some drinks, and some more drinks and even more drinks, after that the night was a blur. I recall us all getting rowdy and tipping the singer girl, and after every tip she'd ring a cowbell of some sort and we'd all cheer and holler. really we kept tipping her out of the sheer novelty of the cowbell im assuming...well at least i was. She kept referring to us as virgins, as it was our first time at the "rusty trombone", so as virgins she honored us with a song request- I wasted no time "COCAINE BLUES!!!!" i shouted, to a few mumbled giggles from the regulars- The Grizzled and bad ass bar tender actually sang the lyrics as the guitarist girl played the tune, and in the most stellar karaoke esque rendition of johnny cash he bellowed out the lyrics to a T! as i sang along drunkenly, probably embarrassing my yelp mates and the two boring birds i'd chatted up at Iruna, some regular swayed past me and pawed at my tousled mop of hair. I recall going to the bathroom and returning to find Jimmy the grizzled barkeep adoringly belting out a ballad to the more attractive of boring girls we'd brought along much to her embarassment and horror, at some point they took their boring selves to their boring homes and we kept drinking and forging bonds that could rival the best of Yelp cliques! I will never forget...well what i remember from that night i will never forget...LOL!Thanks to my newest Yelp friends and thanks to the Rusty Trombone for making a great evening that much greater!In the wild wild southwest there lives a saloon. A saloon that has been around for years and years. In fact, this saloon takes credit for being the first saloon in Scottsdale. No matter what's going on outside the doors on the streets of Old Town; whether it be crowded during spring training or 115 degrees and dead, it's always the same inside the Rusty Spur. The moment you step foot through the doors, you're immediately transformed into a time warp when John Waynes ruled the city and two stepping was the only dancing worth doing in this desert. This is one of my favorite saloons in Old Town. Here, it doesn't matter how much your outfit cost, what kind of purse you have, what your wearing or who you're with. As long as you're ready to have a good time in a crowded setting with plenty of live country music, you're welcome. Here, everyone treats you like a friend and nobody gets upset if their drink spills a little because someone two stepped right into their arm. Here, it doesn't matter if it's 1:00 PM or 1:00 AM because the atmosphere will be the same with most likely the same cover Country band performing. This is truly a gem in Scottsdale. There's a reason it's been around since the beginning and will most likely stick around until the end.Visited this "saloon" in Old Town, Phoenix but I was severely disappointed.  Was looking for a nice place to listen to some country and maybe do a little dancing with the wifey and heard this was the place to go....Nope!  The place is horribly small, no room to even stand in there much less make it to the bar to get a drink.  The music was live but I'm not a big fan of the whole "give me a tip and I'll play you a song" deal.  How about you play some good songs and then I'll give you a tip.  I will not be going back and I don't recommend.
Jade Palace=Located in the Safeway shopping center on the northeast corner of Scottsdale & Pinnacle Peak, this Jade Palace may seem far for some of you, but for some of us living in North Phoenix / Scottsdale, it's the best Chinese around!Jade Palace is a regular in my rotation of consistent dine-in and take-out restaurants and has been for years.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the service is attentive.  The hostesses are always sweet and if you place a take-out order, they make sure that they read your order back to you to avoid any confusion.My favorite dishes are the healthy choice steamed shrimp (or chicken) and veggies, mu shu chicken, and dry sauteed string bean.  Their soups are all really good as well.  The saying 'never order fish in a Chinese Restaurant' does not hold true at Jade Palace - go for it... it's delicious!Devlan, the Manager & Co-owner, can often be found at this location and he is extremely personable and makes sure that all of his customers have a pleasant experience... Whether I'm coming from the gym in workout clothes or I'm dressed from work, dining solo or with a group, I always feel welcome at Jade Palace.  For the food and the service, this is a fantastic restaurant.  If you like Chinese food, check out Jade Palace - I'll see you there!
Stray Cat Bar & Grill=I've been going here for many years. Actually since well before the new owner(s) came in and renamed it Stray Cat. For a long time, I really enjoyed the drink and dinner specials.I've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year. Earlier this year, I brought some of my visiting family to the business because the food and service had been so awesome to that point. For some reason, they had a useless cook working that day who burnt everything he sent out to us ... twice. The owner on site was so embarrassed after we showed him what was served, he offered us gift cards to cover our food. My family vowed never to return. I figured it was a fluke and was impressed that the owner acknowledged the problem and did something to address it.In June, I went in on a Monday and ordered a basket of chicken wings. To my surprise, they were completely out of wings. I ended up going elsewhere to eat that night and sent Stray Cat a private message on their Facebook account letting them know what happened. A month to the day I received a response, "That was a busy weekend for us. We never want to let a loyal customer down. Hope you'll be back to 'Fix' your wing cravings soon."In August, I went in on a Sunday and again ordered a basket of chicken wings. I was stunned because they again were completely out of wings. I sent a followup message to Stray Cat via Facebook letting them know of the pattern and advising they should speak with whomever is doing the product ordering. Their ENTIRE response:      "Maybe eat wings on Friday or Saturday when we're fully stocked"WOW! I immediately went to the bar and requested to speak to the owner who had ironically "just left". I gave a printout of the messages sent back and forth to a server who knows me well, told her what happened and asked to have the owner contact me. No contact what so ever.If this is how they treat a longtime patron now, imagine what this place is headed for. Save your money for a business that actually cares about the people bringing cash through the door. That snarky message was it for me. I'm done.
Denny's=I have been to this Denny's many ,many times over the years. It is close and easy to go to. It is your standard Denny's.The coffee is so so , the staff works hard ,and the food is doable.It has always seemed to be very clean,even the restrooms.There is lots of parking in the lot.The place is always packed,at least most times of the day. Except mid afternoon, that is a much calmer time of day here. Food is very inexspensive so it is always a deal.It is right off the freeway as well, which makes it most convienant for all.Cruise the strip...pass by McD's, Jack in the Box, Del Taco, etc...etc...Everyone's hungry...pointing fingers at this place and that place...Until the majority points four fingers at a Dennys...They coulda dropped me off at those other places n picked me up laterThey ordered breakfast.... looked tasty...I ordered a double cheeseburger combo for breakfast..I git these two huge clumps of meat patties inside the bun..  I tossed one patty to the side...   Burger was dry n tasteless and gross.Fries were soft..  I like my fries burnt a crispyI got pieces of burnt hash brown from my friend's plates and a muffinWhen I think of Denny's I think of a nice, quiet night with an amazing selection of food, drinks, and dessert. You come to Denny's because it's convenient, the food is good, and it's all well-priced. So obviously, this is one of my favorite places. One time, after an all-nighter, I came here with my GF at 5 a.m. and it was the best. It's never too full, which means the service is always fast.The breakfast food is my favorite - I could eat breakfast day and night and I'd get it from here. I'm not a huge fan of the dinner items (fish, burgers, etc.), but it's because of my personal preference on the type of cuisine, not the establishment's food itself. Yesterday we came here because we were too lazy to cook at home LOL and we wanted pancakes. Our server was Michael - he was amazing! He got all our stuff to us very quickly, and I'm pretty sure he was the only waiter waiting on about five or six tables. I'm hoping next time we go to Denny's we'll get him again. :)I'm giving Denny's three stars because it's Denny's...I mean, can you get better food elsewhere? Sure. Can you get better service somewhere else? Yeah, maybe. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still good and it's....cozy. It's not "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" and it shouldn't be (in my opinion) because then that means it's so hyped up that it would always be crowded. And yes, I'm a fan - but I say A-OK because it's a term my grandpa uses to describe something that's pleasant and familiar. It's the old, married couple enjoying dinner after 65 years together; it's the mom and her child coloring outside the lines. Pleasant and familiar :)
Pete's Fish & Chips=Really? What exactly are they famous for??After living in Glendale for about 5 years, seeing people drive around with Pete's bumper stickers, and detouring around 55th and Glendale at rush hour because the drive-through line backs up into the road, we finally tried this. In the end I just have to ask what all of their "fans" are thinking.The fish that's so famous looks and tastes like something you might get from the frozen food section of the store. But only if you got the cheapest store brand possible and made sure it was a SQUARE patty of frozen breaded fish. The fish sandwich was one of the aforementioned fish patties on a cheapo hamburger bun with a smear of sauce. The fries were questionable. Honestly, I'd rather eat fish at Long John Silver's than eat here again.HEY all you Yelpers out there...Howz come it always seems that whenever a restaurant, diner or eatery hits on a successful recipe they wanna tweek it?  Even a lowly place like Pete's is no exception. Years ago, back in the 60's, they hit on one at Pete's. The fried shrimps were outstanding! Nice large juicy shrimps coated in a light crispy batter similar to tempura made it destination dining. Being inexpensive and delicious they appealed to the masses. When I returned from a tour in the USMC, it was beckoning for me to return. Went to the one on South Central and ordered a large shrimp and chips only to find heavily battered deep fried minced shrimps. Disappointed I ate them anyways.Soon, I got used them and continued to go to Pete's. Now fast forward to the present. They are now mass produced minced shrimps coated with bread crumbs then stamped into the shape of a shrimp and deep fried, identical to frozen ones found at any grocery store except they are now more expensive and come with only a handful of French fries! So sad,,,not likely to return unless someone else picks up the tab. I never turn down free food usually!Progress? Bah! 2 stars for the food being hot and convenient.
Johnny Mac's=Maybe its just me...I've never had buffalo wings that have ever blown me away.  Most of them are done the same way everywhere.  I honestly can't tell that much of a difference between this place and any Buffalo Wild Wings although the wing meat at Mac's was pretty dry and some of the drumettes barely had any meat on them.  Definitely a one and done place for me.  Not worth the trek from SW Vegas for.So disappointing! I heard such great things about Johnny Mac's but after having pizza there for dinner, I am far from impressed...I went in with my husband on a Monday night. We were seated in a booth that had ice on the seat, leaving me with a lovely wet spot on my ass. The hostess asked what we would like to drink but didn't know what beers they had. Perhaps management should consider not having drink orders taken by a young girl that doesn't even appear to be old enough to serve liquor...? A second employee came by with our waters a few minutes later. We looked over the menu, waiting for one of the multiple waitresses that walked by to stop and acknowledge us. Finally someone came over, gave us an excuse about how no one knew whose table we were, and took our order. We went with a large mushroom pizza. I debated getting wings since I heard such good things about them but decided to pass. The pizza didn't take long to come out, it felt like we waited longer to order then we did for the food. Upon first glance, the pizza was all good. Nice thin crust that was golden brown, lots of cheese, plenty of mushrooms. The cheese was tasty, as were the mushrooms. The crust was like rubber though, when I picked up a piece to try to take a bite it flopped over. The only part of the crust with any crunch to it was the edges. Pretty disappointing. If I had never heard of Johnny Mac's, this would be my first and only time visiting. Since I live nearby I will probably give them another shot sooner or later... Everyone has an off night at some point, right?Very dive-y looking in the front.We decided to try it out a few months ago when I was pregnant.Wasn't terribly impressed. We ordered a meat plate/sampler, that just had the meat and cheese thrown on there. When our pizza finally came, there was a pool of grease sitting on top of it. I've had it better frozen, out of a box.For whatever reason, we decided to give them a second chance, with delivery, about a month later.There was a mile long black hair baked into our pizza. NO thanks, never again.Johnny Mac's is a strip mall restaurant/bar one could drive by without even noticing- but you should take notice.  Most of the items we've had at Johnny Mac's have been fantastic and reasonably priced.  Another thing that makes this place is great is that it's smoke free.  Believe me, when you first walk in, you expect a cloud of smoke.If you're going for draft beer, consider the $10.50 pitcher to share.  It is a good deal and priced better than buying individual pints.Tonight we had the Beef on Weck special.  If you are not familiar with this Buffalo, NY specialty, it's thin cut roast beef on a toasted kimmelweck roll with a side of au jus.  Johnny's serves it with fries and a pickle.  I've now had this dish twice, and both times it was fantastic.  The meat could be a little rarer, but it is definitely tender and flavorful.  But, to me, this sandwich is all about the roll.  It makes the sandwich superb.We also had the wings tonight, but they were out of the watermelon BBQ sauce I love and the wings were not crispy tonight.  I am not a fan of chewy skin on my wings, so I took a pass on the rest after one bite.After coming for dinner multiple times and take out (pizza) a couple times, I would definitely recommend it to others and will be back.
Alizé=I saved my 100th Yelp review for my Birthday dinner, and a very special restaurant. Alize, on top of the Palms is and exquisite place to eat with a spectacular view, and a huge wine list that is actually presented to you on an iPad. Atmosphere - 5 View - 5 Food - 5 Wine - 5 Service - 5 Overall Experience - 5 If you are eating at this restaurant, you need to order the 7 course chef tasting menu and the wine pairing. The cost will be about $200 per person when you are all finished, but believe me, if you are looking for a stellar experience, amazing food, wine, service and overall execution, you need to order this. Each dish arrived with a glass a wine that was perfectly paired with the food. As a sommelier, I truly appreciate a perfect wine and food pairing, and I was not disappointed. The staff was amazing - professional, cordial, loved their job, and couldn't have done a better job. I was impressed. I will eat here again when I visit Las Vegas...I am already wondering what the new items will be on the chef pairing menu...and of course, what delicious wines I will find perfectly paired.This is a swanky place reserved for special occasions. We dined here on a Sunday and there were only couple of other tables occupied. The view is very romantic as the restaurant is located on the 54th floor of The Palms. It is one of those places that is uncomfortably quiet with elevetor-esque music playing. My boyfriend kept on whispering at first until we got more comfortable and adjusted to the atmosphere. Our server was extremely attentive and had a great attitude. We started off with some cocktails. The wine and cocktail list is presented on the Ipad and left at your table so you can browse the several categories. Once you see something that you like you simply select to order it. Boyfriend had the Devil's Pancake which was a bourbon based drink and extremely potent and delicious. The ginger after taste was just amazing. I had a vodka based cocktail called French (and some # which I forgot). It was extremely delicious..it had Grey Goose and a sugared rim..with fresh raspberries garnish. So good!The menu features a la carte menu or the chef's 7course tasting menu which was $125. We opted to go the a la carte route this time. As an appetizer we had Seared Pork Belly which was pretty good...it came with white cheddar polenta under and a quail egg on top. On the first bite I though the pork belly tasted a little overcooked..but combined with the polenta and runniness of the egg it worked really well. As an entree I opted for the good ol Filet Mignon medium and boyfriend went with Almond Crusted Rack of Colorado Lamb also medium. My contention was that my steak was unevenly cooked, yet his lamb was pretty consistently medium. The fact that my steak was not cooked evenly is the reason I am taking off a star. If I am at a place where I am paying over $50 for a small piece of meat, I'd prefer it blow me away. I would say given the option I would have gone for the lamb as that was just perfect. We opted to skip dessert and order another round of cocktails instead. At the end of dinner we asked the waiter to take our picture who responded with "It would be my pleasure." That was very gracious of him. We definitely did not experience any of the snootiness or bad attitude from any of the staff that some of the other reviews mention. It was a great restaurant for a perfect romantic evening out.My husband made reservations at this restaurant for my birthday dinner. We had reservations at 6:30 and had the restaurant to ourselves for a good 45 minutes before any other guests arrived. We had a window table with a fantastic view of the strip from the Stratosphere all the way down to Mandalay Bay, as this restaurant is on the 56th floor of the ivory tower in the Palms Hotel/Casino.We arrived and our waiter Salvano greeted us and took our drink orders. We ordered off of the tasting course menu. This menu consist of 7 courses. You have a choice of 3 options for each course including one vegetarian option. So the variations are numerous. My husband and I decided to get different entrees for each course to maximize our experience to taste as much of the menu as possible.The first course was a complimentary sampling from the chef. It was pheasant with filo dough wrap, with a strawberry puree, and a cauliflower puree soup. It was a nice surprise to start the evening from the chef.1st course: Russian Golden Ostera caviar and Truffle caviar.($20 supplement)2nd course: Ribeye Carpaccio and Maine Lobster and herb salad3rd course: Sauteed foie gras and Chilled terrine of foie gras4th course: King crab leg croustillant and Tempura calamari5th course: Sauteed Dove Sole and Red Snapper6th course: Aged beef ribeye and Spring rabbitChef palate cleanser consist of meringue coating around grapefruit puree and poppyseed sauce.7th course. Gran Marinier souffle and Chocolate souffle.Overall the dishes were decent size. The variety and flavors in each course made it so unique and delicious. With the foie gras the waiter recommended a glass of Sauternes wine, which was a pairing. The service was impeccable, even when it got busy the wait staff worked as a team to keep up the incredible service. Every waiter was knowledgeable and described in detail each dish as they served it. The view is priceless especially as dusk turned to night and you could see a clear view of the strip lighting up. Awesome!!. Walked out feeling as if we had spent the day at the spa. Totally relaxed and satisfied. Definitely recommend Alize for a very special occasion.What do you do to impress your wife on your anniversary?  Take her to Alizé.I was concerned we'd be too early to see the lights come on as the sun set.  It got dark quickly and we enjoyed the view in both daylight and after dark.  We were seated promptly and as was the case when I ate here before, service was excellent.  We were soon brought two iced teas and then we ordered.We were brought an amuse-bouche of crab in panna cotta on one side and a small piece of foie gras on the other.  One of the runners soon came with a selection of three breads--lavash, regular baguette, and a gluten free roll.  We each took some lavash and the roll.  The roll had great flavor.For the first course, I got the smoked salmon with fried egg and Andrea got the Roasted mushroom Toban-Yaki with miso-mushroom broth.  The plating on my appetizer was just a delight and it was so flavorful!  Andrea enjoyed her toban-yaki and I got a chance to try some of the mushrooms.  Great flavor.For our main courses, I got the beef rib eye and Andrea got the chicken breast with sausage stuffing and chestnuts.  Both were very good.  I finished a small amount of her chicken and I can attest to how good it was.  My beef was perfect.Dessert--I chose the chocolate soufflé and Andrea got the warm peach galette with almond marzipan ice cream.  Two more winners!  After dessert, a runner came with a trolley on which were placed several mignardises from which to choose.  We got two each and it was a pleasant ending to the meal.I got coffee with dessert and it was strong and flavorful!Let me say again how good service was!  Silvano and his crew were on their game during our stay there.  The staff was polite, friendly, and very accommodating.  It was a wonderful dinner with a great view in one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.We were fortunate to arrive at Las Vegas on restaurant week. And read that Alize had one of the best view in Las Vegas and decided to give it a try. We had the front seat and were not disappointed by the view. We had the complimentary carrot soup and small piece of foie gras to start and some bread to fill our tummy while we wait.I ordered the following:Roasted Beets With Aged Goat Cheese, Quinoa, Port Braised Cipollini Onion, Arugula And Truffle VinaigretteI loved the harmony of flavor with the aged goat cheese and the mildly sweet beets. I couldn't really taste the truffle, but it was great nonetheless. If you are not a fan of beets, stay away.Sauteed Irish Salmon With Black Olive Puree, Sauteed Spinach, Artichoke Ravioli And Limoncello NagThe salmon was cooked right to perfection, a second more would've spoiled the salmon. The most surprisingly p art was the artichoke ravioli which had a black cover. The flavor was plain, but with the limoncello sauce and the black pasta skin, it was interestingly delightful.Caramel Crunch Banoffee With Toasted Coconut CreamI liked the flavor and the texture, but had a hard time eating it with my spoon. The tart shell is extremely hard with the caramel crunch crusted on the bottom. I risked clinking the plate a few times, but go through with it with no plates broken.Overall, if you have a romantic outing or proposal or anything in that sort, this is the place.I came here for dinner Saturday evening with a friend.  We did the 7 course tasting menu.  I am not going to go into each course in detail.  It was the summer tasting menu on the restaurant's web page.  Suffice it to say the food was good, the company was excellent, and the view was stunning as always.This was my 4th time to Alizé and most likely my last.  The reason for this came at the end of the meal.  When we got the bill, we noticed we were charged for the caviar course but we didn't order the posted $20 supplement for the one caviar.  When brought to the attention of our captain, she condescendingly stated that she always tells everyone that there is an additional charge for the caviar course--that it's not one of the 7 courses.  Well, this time she didn't, but she was sure she was right.  The online menu has subsequently been changed so there's little chance for confusion.  The amount was taken off the bill but she missed the point totally.  Her customer service was awful!This was one of my favorite places to go because of the food and the view.  I can get good food elsewhere and there are other places in town with a great view and great food, too.  How's that for a "twist" in my feelings?Adieu, Alizé.This is a fine dining establishment on one of the top floors at the Palms. It seemed on the small side. Elegant enough, but kind of bland decor. However, the view is the star of the show here. It's a great view of Vegas and the Strip.The service is impeccable of course. Very fine dining. We went during Restaurant Week. We were handed every menu except the RW one. No one mentioned RW. It was like a super secret thing they didn't want to encourage. And our server's face confirmed that suspicion when I said we wanted to do the RW offering. And it kinda felt like we were looked down upon from then on.For an appetizer, I opted for the escargot. It was good. Not great or amazing, but definitely good. James O. got the french onion soup. It was fabulous.For an entree, I had the salmon. This was the first time I had ever been asked in a restaurant how I wanted my salmon cooked. I went with the server's recommendation. And that turned out rather raw for me. I honestly would've enjoyed the salmon much more if it had been more cooked. But that's my own fault. The salmon sat atop asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes, and was topped with king crab and bernaise sauce. The asparagus was good. The mashed potatoes were wonderful. The king crab was divine. The bernaise sauce was great. James O. got the filet mignon with green peppercorn sauce. It was perfectly cooked and very tasty. When they brought the entrees, they were covered with those fancy silver domes. And the domes were lifted off both of our plates at the exact same time with a flourish. It was a cool touch that made us feel fancy.For dessert, I had the creme brulee and James O. had a lemon fruit tart thing. The creme brulee was great. The tart was kinda meh. They also brought around a candy cart and we got two of each of these different homemade candies. They were all awesome.All in all, it was a pleasant and tasty dining experience.I cannot believe this unfinished review on one of my favorite restaurants has been sitting there for exactly one year! Since I started the drat, we have been back there an additional 3 times. That says something about how much we enjoy Alize. So what makes a restaurant truly memorable? Is it simply saying, "that place was great"? Or is it posting a few pictures on Yelp and giving it 5 stars? Well yes. But for me, I found myself actually missing Alize and their tasting menu, and wanting to go back and experience it all over again. After my first visit in 2010, Alize became, and still remains one of my favorite restaurants. It's the first place we thought of when we made plans for a celebration in Vegas. The service is consistently top notch. The view of The Strip is unrivaled. And of course ... the food, absolutely amazing!We ordered the Summer tasting menu in early September '14. A Fall / Winter tasting menu in January '15 and another tasting menu in May '15. Their consistency was unmatched. Each course came out at near perfect timing. Dirty dishes do not stay on our table long as there seems to be staff members lurking in the darkness, waiting for us to put our utensils down. I won't go over each course individually as their creative menu changes with the season, and could possibly be quite different when you go. But I can state with certainty the plating, the combination of flavors, the view and service makes the entire experience memorable. If I had to complain about something (let's face it, there's no 'perfect' place) is a course called Etorki. I recall it to be a dry cheese course that just didn't work well with my palette and the tasting menu. Also, unless they did a recent remodel, but the men's restroom looks like it belongs at a truck stop. It's small, dark and dingy with an old paper towel dispenser. It's very unlike the whole Alize experience. But I didn't go there to use the restroom. I return to indulge in the whole incredible dining experience provided by the incredible chef and team at Alize.  Highly recommended! Notes: * Top of the Palms. Depending on what time of year you go, reserve a table when the sun sets. The Strip view is incredible as the sky changes color during sunset.* If you ask nicely for a table facing the Strip during the reservation process, they might accommodate, because they are just awesome! * If you're driving to the Palms, remember which garage you parked at. Apparently there are 3 exits and after a few drinks, we forgot where we parked. * Weeknights tend to be a bit less crowded* Excellent place for any type of special occasion.
Space Age Restaurant=Probably the worst place I have ever walked into.I would guess that the ONLY time you will ever walk in here is when you are half way to either San Diego or Arizona.  This town (if you can call it that) seems like nothing more than a pit stop for food and gas before your next one hour drive to civilization.I walked in to what appeared to be a run down diner with a gift shop and a picture of a space ship on the wall.  By far the ONLY reason to walk in here is to get a picture of the space ship (you can see mine posted on Yelp).  I smiled, got my picture taken, and then drove straight to Taco Bell (probably the number one or two place to eat in this town).I am sure you will do the same.Please note:  I did not eat or try their food.  My review is based on the look and feel of the location.
Kabob Palace=Fart Face? Apparently I can't eat a shitty meal without being the subject of pointless ridicule. Maybe if I was as high off of my own ego as one reviewer (let's call her "Dog Shit"), I would've enjoyed the charcoal briquettes trying to pass as lamb kabobs DS recommended. Or the oil pouches masquerading as the 'traditional' fried eggplant app I've had at many Med eateries....maybe 'ingenuity' was the wrong word -- 'flavor' was sufficient -- but wtf? Is that what this spat is about? Word choice? 'Rebellious iconoclast' is redundant, but I don't get my rocks off on scrutinizing sloppy diction on a fucking food reviewing website. DS is defensive b/c I had a bad meal at a restaurant she likes. BFD! This is about the food, not you, DS. It's always about the food! I could give two shits about what you or your cadre of ass-kissing lemmings who drool over every SAT word and spunky made-up phrase populating your reviews think about Kabob Palace. I just want tasty food. Maybe it was an off night -- who knows. But unless you're paying, I'm not going back.So let's just boil this shit down to its essence: The food I ate SUCKED. Get over it.
King Gyros=Greatest gyros in town! Paul C. and myself tried one of the more expensive, fancier, Rep rated trend joints and there was no comparison. What they lack in atmosphere they make up for with delicious food and great service! One time I spilled tzaziki sauce on my shoe and nearly ate it without thinking...that's how good the stuff is. They would be the perfect sunday lunch place if only they were open on Sunday.Wow, so good Mom and I ate  take out twice this week for lunch !!!  The Gyros were done  very well, ready for pick up and the salads are tasty. Their bread is great  even eaten alone .I don't know what else to say about this place that hasn't already been said... but it is honestly the BEST Mediterranean spot in the valley. Gyros, shawarma, hummus, french fries, kabob... and get this: they also make homemade pasta! Absolutely delicious. It's a family owned restaurant and I had such a nice conversation with the owner; she's a sweetheart and is hands on with everything about the business. ALWAYS order the tzatziki sauce with everything you get!
Uncle Joe's Pizza=Feeling like pizza and being in the area of Uncle Joe's meant that something good was in store for dinner.We parked in a dirt lot on Ogden and 6th. It is free and plenty of other cars are parked there and I have seen security walk by it before. It isn't that far of a walk to Fremont St from here.Upon entering Uncle Joe's there was luckily one table left! They have a TV and some college game was on that people were going crazy over. We change up what we get each time. This trip we got a large pepperoni pizza and 2 fountain drinks. The total for that was $13.65! You can't beat it! The pizza was made fresh and brought to our table with plates, silverware and napkins. It was delicious as always. If you have any left overs they will give you to go boxes.The inside is very clean. The moment someone gets up from a table to leave there is someone wiping down the table. If you don't prefer fountain drinks they to offer sodas in a can. I saw Pepsi and Cherry Pepsi.If you like cheese steak sandwiches then you must try the one here. It is made fresh to order and is very good.Uncle Joe's pizza has just become my favorite place to get a New York Style of pizza (AKA Thin Crust) in LV. LOCATED in downtown LV in the newer portion of Fremont Street past the light show experience and across Insert Coins.  Their PIZZA has all the quality's of a thin crust that I love. First, they use just the right amounts of cheese. Let me explain what the right amount of cheese is to me. Other pizza joints will use too little, making the cheese blanket too thin which in turn will cause the tomato sauce to over power, or they will put too much turning the cheese almost to a glue like texture. Here, they use the perfect balance. Second, the crust. OMG the crust the crust. The crust here is light and crispy. If I had to describe it, I would say somewhat similar to a thick potato chip. But not to crispy where it's tough like cardboard either. In comparison to others, most other thin crust pizzas have very soft crust which makes it limp. Which is why you have to fold the pizza in half before you eat it. Now I know what your thinking, that's the way pizza is supposed to be and its nostalgic to eat it like that and so on...and your right but this crust is pretty good too. Last but not least, the pepperoni was crispy like bacon and had the right spice to my liking. The pizza has just the right amount of grease/oil to it but definitely not overflowing.PRICE is excellent. You can purchase a pretty decent size slice for around 3 to 4 bucks or the whole pie.  The ENVIRONMENT here is small with only a few tables. So if there is no seats then its best to take your slice to go. SERVICE here is good. They don't smile at you when you enter but they do however greet you, take your order, quickly get your slice, and tell you good-bye on the way out. What more can you ask for.  Overall, I love this place. I will definitely make this place a must stop on every trip and If I lived in LV then I would be picking up pizza from these guys all the time.
Kona Grill=Things to get at Kona Grill.Macadamia Nut Crusted Chicken.Things not to get at Kona Grill.Everything else. Pros: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not. Cons: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not. Misc.: Basement like atmosphere. Car fumes. Families (ugh, i.e., CHILDREN). You're still in a mall. Aloha Kona. Aloha. Mele Kelikimaka. Mahalo. Magnum P.I.
Zipp's Sports Grill=When you make the assertion that a place has "The best F'ing veggie burgers on the PLANET" and throw your arms up in the air in exclamation, you better know why you are talking about. Being that I have been a vegetarian for over 14 years now, I have had a LOT of veggie burgers and I hate to burst your bubble, Dally G, this is NOT the best F'ing veggie burger on the planet. It was tasty, I will give you that, but only because it was smothered with sweet jalapeno sauce, pepper-jack cheese and fresh jalapenos. I am not a fan of those garden patty's. Nor my soggy fries. Both times I have been here it was pretty packed. The first time, on a Sunday, the service was horrible and the waitress was quite the snob. Fortunately last nights visit was quite a bit better, but I think that is because our waitress wanted to give me the business. So... they have some good specials, I will give them that. The food is okay. The service leaves a little something to be desired. I couldn't figure out which bathroom I was supposed to use and the parking is pretty bad. but, they do have a cool patio with fire pits.  Because I am nice and the coffee is good this morning I am rounding up my 2.5 stars to a 3.Could I give this place NO STARS???My girlfriend and I head in and sit down with a group of friends already there. We smile and wave at the waitress to let her know more people joined and she purposely makes us wait at least 10 minutes.I am not a fan already... but yes, it gets worse, people. She brings our drinks out after another table sits down and orders theirs. Our friends are catching on and order a round. Get them before ours. Gosh, does she discriminate against blondes?? I am wondering. Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings. Didn't get it.At this point I go up to the manager and ask if the gal is super busy tonight or if something is up in the kitchen. No, and no. I tell him what's going on and he tells me he'll come out in a moment.Oh... that moment was priceless. He actually said we were rude to her and should be lucky she even continued to serve us. He must be screwing her so I am OUT OF THERE! My tip to folks. Sit at the bar if you must go. There are plenty of other spots out there that will treat you wayyyyyyyy better, have better service, food and prices.THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! I wish I could give it no stars. I had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week. Their PR person contacted me and asked more about it, so I told them. They asked if they could pass my information along to the Director of Operations/Owner and I received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that I am a self-righteous b*tch who knows nothing about customer service and I only care about myself. Todd Goldman, the owner who so kindly took "the time to teach young girls like [me] life lessons" about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that I "get so mad and take it so personally that [I] fail to think rationally while [I] struggle with the idea that [I am] not the most important person in the world". Apparently my "myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of [myself] are staggering". Whatever he may feel about me, I do know one thing about him: I will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again. This does not seem to bother Mr. Goldman because, as he told me in his letter from this evening, according to him, "[I] feel that [I] am so influential in this community that [my] posting will dissuade people from visiting [their] establishments". I only wish I could attach the PDF letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it. I cannot imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer, and yes, I do hope that people read this and see that they should pick Fox Sports Grill, Half Moon, Blue 32, Firehouse Bar and Grill, Duke's, American Junkie or any of the 1000 other sports bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix to enjoy their bar food, beer and sports viewing. It is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and Mr. Goldman should be ashamed of himself.***ADDITION 10/19/2010***I was currently in the building with 11 guests, sitting at a 6 person table when I asked to be accommodated.  I was not asking him to "hold" tables for us, I was asking that they take care of  "actual customers".
Chicago Joe's Restaurant=I finally dined at Chicago Joe's after long wanting to sample the classic Italian fare of this downtown fixture.  Despite high hopes for a great meal, after finishing a five-course dinner here I am sorry to report that I was underwhelmed by very uninspired cooking.  An appetizer of Arancini, served with duo sauces of Marinara and Alfredo, was okay, but on the dry side.  Unwarmed Italian Bread and butter, and a beany bowl of Pasta Fagioli, tasted good.  A fairly simple salad of greens, a couple of tomato slices, a touch of carrot, and a black olive, with a Vinaigrette Dressing was fine but nothing special.  And then came the really disappointing entry!My $33 entree of Veal & Peppers, with mushrooms and onions and an included pasta side, was extremely pedestrian.  Beyond pounding, the veal was ultra-thin, not very tender, and actually resembled luncheon meat.  And the strands of peppers that topped the meat seemed like they had been shaved off a thicker vegetable base.  However, the Spaghetti Bolognese with Mushrooms that came with the entree was good and hearty.  An average-size Cannoli tasted good but was rather ordinary, while a large slice of Chocolate Cheesecake that was not house made was excellent.  Service was good, and the ambiance in this very small eatery homey and comfortable.  But I doubt I will be back.There are just too many other better Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas valley to warrant a return.I recall this place being a lot better before. I have been there for dinner and from what I remember, the portions were large, ingredients fresh, and prices reasonable. A co worker and I were in the area and decided to try Chicago Joe's for lunch. The server was helpful and attentive, but he gave my co worker a glass with a huge crack down the middle. That could have ended very badly.The lunch specials are pricey for the amount of food that you get. We opted for a chicken parmigiana for $9.95. It consisted of a small scoop of cold pasta in an overly sweet pasta sauce, and a piece of breaded chicken no larger than the palm of my hand. The chicken also had gristle which was very gross. Overall the taste of the food was solid, the prices were too high for what you get, and the service was solid enough. I wouldn't rush back here again.
Venezias New York Style Pizzeria=Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place, yet!I used to come here at least twice a week, back in 2003 when I used to live in Maricopa and in 2004 when I finally moved to Chandler.  Venezia's Pizzeria was nearby the Chandler-Gilbert Community College (cool academic institution, IMO) I attended at that time.  I remember grabbing a $1 side salad at McDonald's and then heading over to Venezia's for a slice of crispy thin-crust cheeze pizza w/ spinach... those were the days!  :)  I really thought I'd reviewed this place, but this could've been pre-Yelp and during my Citysearch phase...Finally had a reason to stop at Venezia's for dinner a little less than three weeks ago, so I decided I'd try a whole order of white pizza, no sauce.  While good on its own, this pizza came to life w/ many dashes of roasted red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan cheese.  The thin-crust didn't fare so well- it was soggy before you could say "cheese" (pardon the pun!), but I managed.  Too bad this pizzeria doesn't serve wine... I urgently felt the need to balance out the grease w/ a glass of wine, so my next stop was an Irish pub on Boston and Arizona...Venezia's delivers!  I mean that in every sense of the word.  We were out looking around the area one day and found this location.  Since we had just eaten we did not stop but I put it in my memory banks for future meals.  I checked their website and found that they delivered to my area.  Yay!  There is nothing like good pizza delivery after a long day. I have ordered delivery many times from this location and each time they appear at my door in the alloted timeframe with my fresh, hot pizza exactly the way I ordered it!  I have never called them but used their online ordering system and it works like a charm.  My requests have always been fulfilled.  The delivery drivers deliver with a smile and are always courteous. As for the pizza.....YUM!  It is a New York Style pizza with lots of cheese and great, fresh toppings.  They  have Sicilian style but I'm kinda stuck on NY.  :)  They also have a children's menu.  My daughter is a picky eater and, while she like plain cheese pizza her favorite is black olives.  I can order the mini cheese and have black olives put on it for her and that works much better then getting a portion of a larger pizza for her.  She is happy having her very own little pizza.  Their salads are always fresh and crisp.  I have not tried their wings yet but I'm sure I will.  They have some great specials too.  If you are near one of their locations within their delivery area give them a try!  I'm sure I will go to this location at some point but their delivery is so great, I'm not sure when that will be.  Thank you for delivering Venezia's!!!We live near so much good pizza that it's incredibly hard to choose now.  I had not eaten at Venezia's until almost 2 months ago, and we did the lunch special with a slice and a salad and a drink.  I forget the exact total, but it runs right around 6 bucks.  GREAT deal and GREAT pizza.Then, we've gotten delivery twice and I am so impressed with their website and online ordering system.  It's the best I've ever used.  You can customize the order, apply a coupon code, and pay online.  Both times we've ordered online we got our pizza in approximately 45 minutes.  And both times the driver was very friendly and had the cc receipt all ready for me to sign.  We've had the Meat Lovers, Pesto w/ artichokes & sausage, and the Hawaiian and enjoyed them all.  This pizza really reminds me of pizza I've had in NY.  The toppings are fresh and the crust is the right amount of yeasty chewiness.  Right now, Venezia's is my #1 choice for pizza.
King Tut Cafe & Catering=King Tut's is both my scene and not my scene. Moving out here from New York, I was thrilled to find hookah places, and also one that was open late with floor seating in private booths and decent Egyptian food at good prices. The atmosphere is definitely a bit run-down in a good way, and the waiters are pretty on point, especially in dealing with such a huge crowd. But that crowd is the other thing. I was shocked to find that the hookah scene was primarily filled with frat boys and sorority girls. It still perplexes me how this crowd, many of whom seem completely uninterested in world culture, has made this place their home. Fine for them, but if you're not in that scene or an ASU student, be prepared to feel like you've just gone to Psi Delta Psi or whatever for their hookah-themed party where everyone knows everyone else.  King Tut's knows who their target audience is, and I always am annoyed when they turn off the loud Middle Eastern music for the latest hip-hop. It just makes it seem more like a frat party. I love a party vibe, but I also feel out of my element.
Burrito Express=Burrito Express...how do I describe you? You're like a dive bar...that only serves Mexican food and no alcohol. You're not in the greatest part of town. You're located in a less than reputable shopping center. Your parking lot is treacherous (only one way in and out with minimal parking). But I'm not here to review your atmosphere. I'm here to review your awesome burrito! I stopped in one afternoon to grab something quick. I didn't expect that when I ordered my food that it would be THAT quick, however. From the time I made my choice to the time I sat down, I don't think five minutes elapsed. When my Chicken, Potato & Cheese burrito came out, it was piping hot! My particular burrito was on the spicy side...which is how I like it. Now, I know that the menu had the little "hey, idiot...this is spicy" symbol next to this burrito. However, I was caught a little off guard at how spicy it actually was. To put it mildly, it's been quite some time since I ate something spicy enough to give me the sniffles.The burrito was quite sizable, too. For comparative purposes, I'd say it falls right between a Chipotle burrito and one from Q'Doba. It was definitely very filling. Couple the size of the burrito with the massive amounts of shredded chicken and potatoes inside, and I was full for quite some time afterwards.Price wise, I think I ended up spending around $8.00 for the burrito and a "medium" drink that would make a camel think twice before drinking it. Couple that with the awesome red and green salsas they keep in the refrigerator, and you're set!If you're looking for quick Mexican food for a decent price (and  you're not overly-concerned with ambiance or location), then stop by Burrito Express. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner (combination plates), so you can come any time of day. If you don't want to stop by, they deliver, too!Normally I have been a fan of Burrito Express and order from them 5-6 times a year. My neighbor had food delivered to him yesterday and I was trying to relax in my home next door but found it impossible as there was a car with the bass so loud everything was vibrating. So I go out side and ask the guy nicely if he could turn the volume down when coming into the neighborhood. He is like, "oh, I can't do that as they are 1200 somethings he said...., ya da ya da ya! I'm thinking REALLY!!!! So I told him that was rude/disturbing coming into neighborhoods with it that loud. He could have cared less! So today I call to talk to the manager as there wasn't one there when I called yesterday afternoon. She picks up the phone and I told her what happened. She is like - ok, I will talk to him. No sorry for the disturbance, no asking who it was (because she knew). She sounded like she could care less also. I told her he should have turned it off when he got in the car to leave. She didn't care. Then I asked her what her name was - because I didn't want someone pretending to be a manager who wasn't. She refused to give it to me. She said this is a family business and I told her I know as I order from you, but how do I know you are the manager if you won't give me your name. She didn't care, didn't apologize, just had a snotty attitude. Then a couple minutes after hanging up my phone rings and it is them again - thinking oh she is gonna apologize for her unprofessionalism. Nope! I answer and same girls voice "Oops, got the wrong number" - are you kidding me, grow up. So I am done doing business with them and my neighbor who ordered wasn't happy about the situation either. Two rude employees who obviously don't care that much about customer service for their family business.I am placing Burrito Express just inside the 3 star camp.  A qualified 3 stars, 3 stars for the category...little Mexican joints.  Is that a category?  If it's not it should be.Anyway, just inside 3 stars.  Maybe 3.05433 or 3.06155.  Not as far as 3.14159 though.  Definitely not.  I had a burrito with potato, egg, cheese and ham.  It was big.  Not huge but pretty big.  I mean it didn't bludgeon me with it's girth or anything but it was pretty big.  It was good.  Not mind blowing good or anything but good.  Like I would have it again but I wouldn't drive far for it.  Like I would drive a few miles.  Probably only a few though.  Not a score of miles, that's for sure.  I would drive more than a couple but less than, say, 10 for one of their breakfast burritos.  Probably about 4 if I had to rate the burrito based on how far I would drive for it.  But there are other places closer to my office with good burritos.  So if I was somewhere, say within about 4 miles of Burrito Express and I was in the mood for a large but not too large breakfast burrito that was pretty good I would consider going to Burrito Express.  I'm not saying I would definitely go, like I'm not making a commitment by any means here, but I would think about it.  Probably.  Then again, I might not.  I might forget about Burrito Express, actually.What were we talking about?¡Su burrito de desayuno es muy bueno! I've been to Burrito Express a couple times, and on each occasion, I was drawn to have breakfast for dinner. The first time, I tried the regular ham and egg burrito. It's big with healthy amounts of egg, ham, and cheese throughout. The dish is served with a side of lettuce and the servers will bring out bottles of red and green sauce to top it all off. In the mood for even more? Step up your breakfast burrito game and get one with steak and eggs. It's what you'd expect and loaded with potatoes to boot. This one had me full and satisfied. My wife enjoys their bean and cheese burrito.The inside of the establishment is deceivingly spacious for the location. You can choose to hunker down at a table or booth, all within viewing distance of the big TV on the wall. I noticed that each time I went the TV channel was playing an international or uncommon American sport like women's boxing or volleyball. The outside of the restaurant even promotes English Premier League soccer, so that's pretty cool too.So, hey, whenever you're in the mood for some conveniently priced, quick and tasty Mexican food, give Burrito Express a try.¡Adios amigos!
El Charro Restaurant & Cocktail Lounge=I was totally creeped out by El Charro when I first went in there.  Super dark (like, you seriously cant see in there for about 5 minutes when you first walk in and are literally blinded by the AZ sun when you come back out), cold, and at the time SERIOUSLY smoky (but not anymore).  Its very small and cave-like, but dont let the weird ambiance deter you from trying this mexican joint.I always have the cheese tea, which is just a cheese quesadilla so I dont know why they have this odd name...  They also have the mexican cheese tea which is filled with cheese and beef.  Its lathered in butter so be prepared to hit the gym afterwards, but its worth it.  The burritos are good too, and surprisingly I hear they make an exceptional cheeseburger. Be forewarned, El Charro closes for three months in the summer, so call for open hours.
Piero's Italian Cuisine=For a night on the town in Vegas, we opted for an off the strip Old Vegas style restaurant. My brother raved about this place and told us of the great food and Old Vegas charm. Our reservation was at 8pm and before we were seated we headed for the bar. The bar was a separate room and there was a piano and a lounge singer on the corner which reminded me of Frank Sinatra. He sang the classics: Fly me to the Moon, Luck Be a Lady...I was transported in another time, a glimpse of that Old Vegas that is now hard to find amongst the new glitz and glitter that Vegas has now become. The cocktails at the bar was served stiff but expect steep prices...my hubby's kettle and soda was $12 and my wine was $15. The servers, hostess and lounge singer all seemed like a character from an old movie...they were older, very proper, but with an Italian flair so much like those I would see in Sopranos, minus the gangster attitude.Our waiter who greeted us was very friendly and told us about the specials. He mesmerized my group with his explanation of the food. he had a great italian 'soprano" accent and a pompador hair which he kept in character the whole time. I ordered the Osso Bucco, a special of Pieros and a dish I have never had and most of my friends ordered veal. It seems veal is the way to go here, as the menu is full of veal. All I can say is everyone in our table ooh'd and aah'd over the food. My osso bucco was cooked for 4-6 hrs with the bone intact and my waiter stuck a little fork in the bone as I realized Im to eat the bone marrow! Cool I never had that before. The veal is tender, flavorful, and the bone marrow is unforgettable. My hubby's veal with quartered mushrooms, capers and wine butter sauce was also amazing. I couldn't help but be greedy as I ate from his plate too. This place is an experience in its own...receiving many accolades and culinary awards. its not the glitzy in-your-face-Vegas so don't expect a contemporary and ultra modern space. It is fine dining but it is unpretentious, has a dated feel with an old vegas charm. I loved the food here and I am planning to come back and have another chance at the menu.Love the old school Vegas vibe of this place.  It's like someone could get whacked at anytime here...in a good way!!Went with the house specialty, osso buco and loved every tender bit of it!  Too bad you can't order extra marrow on the side.  I feel guilty eating veal for about 30 seconds and get over it.  The cocktail lounge is awesome.  This would definitely be the place to get a martini.  Too bad for me I go looney after 3 and wanted to remember this meal.  They had a duet cranking out all the oldies which really took you back to a different time in Vegas.  Good stuff.  I'll still reserve Ferraro's as the best Italian place I've been to in LV but the ambiance and food really make this place one of a kind around here.Piero's is a solid go-to for traditional Italian in Vegas. I like that it's not a chain. It has an old-school feel inside with dark lighting and white tablecloths. The waiters are dressed to the nines and act very formal (in a good way). Here is what we ordered:-glasses of prosecco-proscuitto and melon-"garbage" (Piero's connotation, not mine) caesar salad (meaning it has alot of ingredients in it: avocado, shrimp, etc.)-house salad-fettucine alfredo-veal osso bucco (also comes with a side of fettucine noodles in the osso bucco sauce)Everything was delicious, especially the veal osso bucco. You definitely don't need a knife. Service was spot-on. I knock off one star because the fettucine alfredo, although delicious, comes in a distant second to the fettucine alfredo at Il Mulino in south Florida.I'm not a fan of Italian food, but I *AM* a fan of weird retro ambiance...which this place has in spades!! To me, it wasn't so much Rat-Pack-y as it was '80s Vegas -- more precisely, Golden-Girls-Go-To-Vegas: pastels on the wall, lots of beige, smell of Geritol in the air, old-school food and drink, Pia Zadora (!!!) playing in the lounge. FABULOUS! As mentioned, I don't care much for Italian food, but what I had here was excellent: prosciutto & melon appetizer, "garbage" Caesar salad and osso bucco. Bonus: this is one of the few spots I don't feel out of place ordering a Campari & soda, so I had two of those, as well! The prices are a bit steep, but just do as I did and have a fast-talking name-dropping deal-making TV producer/pornographer take you. Problem solved!To be honest, because of this place's pedigree, I was expecting a bit more mob shtick here. But rather than be disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised by the weird 80s grandma vibe. Let's be real, Rat Pack-era Vegas is played out anyway -- 80s Vegas is the new 60s Vegas!*** Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2014 menu ***I've been wanting to try Piero's for many years.  It's one of those places that have a lot of history with the city and some of its famous entertainers and residents.I was brought bread and iced tea soon after being seated.For the first course, there was no choice.  It was an agnolotti and cheese combination.  There were five agnolotti in a cream sauce and a triangle shaped piece of fried mozzarella.  The server ground parmesan onto the agnolotti to my liking.  This starter dish was very good.  When eating the fried mozzarella, I couldn't help but think of my students and their senior prom.  They always cleared the place out of mozzarella sticks.  The second course was a choice salads.  I chose the Caesar and the server did freshly ground pepper to my liking.  The romaine was as crisp as can be and the dressing was great!  A large salad course but I managed!For the third course, I had to go with the house specialty--Osso Buco.  It was amazing!  The meat gently came off the bone and the sauce in which the veal shank was braised was very good.  The server brought me a cocktail fork and stuck it in the bone to use as a marrow fork.  A straw would have been a good idea, too!  Along with the Osso Buco, there was a nice sized mound of fettuccine.  It had the brazing sauce poured over it.  Again, the server round parmesan over the dish.  I've had Osso Buco a few times before but it was never this good.  You can tell their process takes hours.  Service throughout the night was exemplary.  There must have been 10 people at least on duty and every one of them worked every table.  I was asked several times if I wanted a fresh iced tea.  When I finished my first glass, immediately a server appeared to take the glass to be refilled.  An empty pack of Sweet 'n Low was removed within moments of putting it on the table.  One of the servers who hadn't been at my table took my check and payment.  No waiting.  It's all for one and one for all.  Many of the Yelp reviews refer to this as old school.  I agree, and I think it's a great idea.  Seeing the servers with white jackets, watching the plates be pushed by my table on a rolling cart, having service that is outstanding--these may be characteristics of old school, and it's good that some places retain their old school ways.My only complaint with the place is the mandatory valet parking.  The lot isn't that big.  I can walk.  If some want to valet, let them.  A requirement--no, it shouldn't be!A Vegas classic...This place has been around for many years and even featured in one of my favorite movies ever, Casino! We came here for Valentine's Day per my man and I was hoping for the best as it wasn't exactly on my radar. We both left disappointed. To start off, an older lady who has probably been the host since it opened wasn't friendly and that's how the experience began. We arrived early and were seated near the kitchen however there were many other tables open including booths. Not cool. The room itself was a little odd. The low ceilings and outdated furniture wasn't pleasing to my eyes as I'm always into the decor. Odd space and it didn't feel like a classic Italian restaurant. We must have been served by 6 different people this evening which was a little odd however they were all very nice. Now let's get to the food -Started with a few cocktails, a lemon drop for me which was very smooth and a belvedere and ginger ale for my man which he enjoyed and had a few of them before the end of the evening. His second drink wasn't correct so we had to send it back. Crispy bread was brought over with very good butter. Next we ordered crispy cheese with house marina that was a little on the spicy side and this happened to be my favorite part of the meal. After that came a garbage Caesar salad that was traditional with a few extras like - avocado, shrimp and tomatoes. The salad was on the bland side, was hoping for a more flavorful dressing. Next came out entrees - osso bucco for him and penne alla vodka for myself. The osso bucco was fantastic loaded with flavor and bone marrow. We both enjoyed it very much. My penne was bland and boring. I make this dish better at home, was very disappointed. For dessert we had two large chocolate dipped strawberries that were super juicy and we thoroughly enjoyed them. The bill came and it was nearly $250. Not worth it. I've had cheaper meals that were much more memorable. At this price I expect at least one food orgasm and it never came :(I have long wanted to eat at this purveyor of classic Italian food with an "Old School" Las Vegas vibe and a longstanding reputation for memorable dining.  Now that I finally have, I am pleased to report that my high expectations were exceeded.  We had 6:00 p.m. reservations, and, when all Las Vegas Convention Center lots were full at 3:45 p.m., restaurant management was kind enough to permit us to park here without charge.  Normally it is valet parking only.When we returned from the Las Vegas Jewelry & Watch Show, Diane and I were quickly shown to our requested booth, and soon enjoyed a starter of cheesy and gooey Mozzarella Fritta with thin and spicy Marinara Sauce, along with exceptional crusty Italian bread and butter.  By the end of the meal, we (mostly me) had collectively consumed almost two entire loaves. A House Salad with fresh tomato, carrots, Green Bell Peppers, Red Onion, Iceberg Lettuce, and a light Italian Dressing was cool and refreshing, and a half Garbage Caesar Salad with Romaine Lettuce, tomato, a generous amount of avocado, croutons, Hearts of Palm, and large chunks of tasty shrimp was even more delectable.I wanted to sample the Verdure e Legumi in Brodo, so I requested a half order.  When the so-called cup of soup arrived, I was shocked to see that the white lion-headed crock containing the hot liquid would have qualified as a bowl almost everywhere else.  But not here!  After being on the lookout for a bowl, I finally found one being carried through the dining room by a server.  And it was a huge white ceramic tureen covered by a plate.  As good as the soup was, I was glad that I only had to face a half order.  Filled with cauliflower, spinach, carrot spears, celery, vermicilli, mushrooms, and a very tasty vegetable broth, the soup was simply great.The chef then surprised us by sending out from the kitchen complimentary Creamed Corn Au Gratin with Parmesan Cheese, which was sweet and creamy.  But nothing overshadowed my delicious signature dish entree of tender, falling off the bone Osso Bucco: a perfectly prepared slow-cooked veal shank mingling with a light tomatoey sauce and al dente fettuccine.  Meanwhile Diane greatly enjoyed her main of Veal Scaloppine Parmigiana topped by requested homemade Alfredo Sauce, and accompanied by splendid Roasted Potatoes.     A dessert tray then beckoned with several tantalizing treats.  But, since Diane is allergic to berries, we had to turn back a chosen Cream Puff when we saw that it contained pieces of strawberry inside.  With sincerely expressed apologies, a slice of Carrot Cake with Coconut-Flaked Cream Cheese Frosting was quickly presented as a suitable replacement, for which we were not charged even though I was quite willing and poised to pay for everything we ate.  There was no reason for any restaurant employee to know of Diane's allergy.Service from our highly competent waiter John Y. and his able assistants was on point all evening, with unbidden water refills, and requests for more bread and butter quickly accommodated.  Our booth was very comfortable, and, despite a bustling dining room, the ambiance was somewhat romantic with dimmed lights overhead.I will surely return for more fine Italian cuisine and hospitality.We had early evening reservations for a group of 4 on Tuesday of this week. We were seated at a table in the bar area where it's a bit noisy but convivial, especially the one chick grinding on her boyfriend's lap at the bar. Group orders cocktails, appetizers, salad, 4 entrees, a bottle of wine, dessert. Service and alcohol are wonderful; food mostly bland except for the veal chop parmesian, which was excellent. The service has been paced perfectly: no long waits between courses and no courses overlapping. Group has just finished dessert and has paid the bill -- a mere $600 -- and two of the group are slurping up the last of the wine. Older dude (I'd generally use the more respectful "gentleman" but it doesn't apply in this case) comes over and says, "It's time for you to leave. You've been here long enough." Group looks up and thinks he's being funny. Nope. Crabby dude says, "I'm serious. I'm the manager here and I need this table." Group looks around. There are two empty tables next to us. Most of us are fairly cosmopolitan and have eaten at swanky places all over the world, but never, repeat, never has anything so uncouth and rude happened to us in a supposedly classy but definitely expensive joint. We could certainly understand if the four of us had been loud and obnoxious or rude or cheap or spent an extra hour dawdling after we'd finished our meals. And even then we would have expected the manager to say something like, "Hey, I'm sorry but we need this table for a large group. What if you head over to the bar and I'll buy you a drink?" The woman who had treated us was not only livid, but embarrassed, and she dashed out of the restaurant. Two of us were slower and a different manager came up to apologize for the old man, saying that had happened a few times that week. What? We then made our way through the throngs of people waiting to be seated -- oh, sorry, there were only about 4 people standing in the lobby.So, a fun evening with friends was soured for no reason whatsoever. Plus I had to use up time which could be spent on better things writing this because I could never forgive myself if I didn't. For the record, the dishes I classified as bland were the mussels (puny mussels in broth not even interesting enough to dip bread in -- if you're into mussels, try the green mussels from New Zealand served at The Barrymore up the street), the shrimp appetizers, the garbage salad and the Osso Bucco, which was tender but didn't taste much different than mom's pot roast.
Arcadia Farms Cafe=Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny.I'm listening to 2 Live Crew as I'm writing this so I'm feeling extraordinarily misogynistic. Forgive a brotha. There are two things you should know about this place, and it pretty much sums up my entire existence... Take a girl here on a lunch date. She will see you as sensitive and intuitive. You may want to use phrases like "I feel..." and "When Carrie gave her assistant that Louis Vuitton..."Order the Mushroom tart. Or is it tort? If you follow my advice, gentlemen, you'll have a great day. Good luck. And god speed.I've been to Arcadia Farms several times since my last review...Spotty service a few times, i admit, but I can't bring myself to take off a star since their food and iced tea are so fantastic!I went today for a baby shower and we had the back room for our group of 20+ ladies.  They gave us a limited menu so I couldn't order my usual (warm vegetable salad with chicken).  Instead, I decided to try something new... I went with the "wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart."  It was delicious!  The cheese was not overpowering and each bit had the perfect balance of the crust with caramelized leeks, spinach, mushroom and cheese... it was served with a mixed green salad on the side.  Yum!The AF staff did a great job with keeping our glasses filled with iced tea and lemonade and everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  AF continues to be a fave destination in my books!Gabi K and I happen to be "ladies who lunch."Arcadia Farms is THE perfect location for ladies who lunch, as it turns out...A perfectly made pitcher of iced tea, an heirloom tomato salad with mini mozzarella balls and sweetly poised basil. VERY good. Everything on the menu was quite tempting, including the desserts that greet you upon entering. EVIL tactics. For a moment in time, we were those lucky ladies. I just need more jewelry, and a better car. ;)Visit # 827 to Arcadia Farms...Since my last update over a year ago, I've literally been to Arcadia Farms way too many times to count (which is why I will estimate 827 total visits above).I've never once had a bad meal at Arcadia Farms... and I'm proud to say, I've ventured away from what my 'usual' order is on several occasions.  You really cannot go wrong at this place, but my favorite dishes are:*For appetizers: the brie cheese and the crab and avocado tower* For entrees: goat cheese tart, salmon, grilled vegetable salad, pesto shrimp salad, strawberry chicken salad, raspberry goat cheese salad, tuna sandwichAnd again, the apricot iced tea is my favorite in town!Despite how amazing their desserts look and sound, I always refrain from dessert because the meal is so filling!This is the perfect ladies lunch spot and although it's a bit pricey, it's so worth it for the fresh, healthy, and delicious food and the lovely ambience.  Keep up the great work, Arcadia Farms... I hope to be a loyal customer for years to come!Yes... I am writing yet another review for Arcadia Farms.  I've been in more times than I can count and aside form slow service once or twice, I've always been extremely pleased with the ambiance, service, food, quality, and overall experience.Whether it's lunch with a girlfriend or two, a business meeting, lunch with my family, out-of-town friends, and even baby and wedding showers... i love this place.  But can you believe it took me this long to go check out their breakfast?I was part of a business breakfast meeting at Arcadia Farms earlier this week.  We chose the venue because of the private dining room and it worked out perfectly.  Tiffany was our waitress and she was fabulous.  I had one too many cups of coffee so I was feeling great!  I also enjoyed fresh squeezed OJ and a delicious egg white asparagus scramble.  It came with potatoes and fresh fruit - I also had a side of whole wheat toast.  The other menu options looked fabulous also; whether you're in the mood for fruit, pancakes, yogurt, omelettes, french toast, smoked salmon, or the AF signature wild mushroom, spinach and leek quiche (which I bet is similar to their amazing wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart), there is something for everyone!Our business breakfast was wonderful not only because of the people that attended, but because of the experience we had at Arcadia Farms.  Now I can add Arcadia Farms to my breakfast rotation in addition to my lunch rotation!  See you there!What's a French cottage doing in the middle of Scottsdale? I don't know, but I adore it. I had lunch here with my lovely gal pals, along with scores of other ladies who lunch. Everything is so dainty and cute here, it might not be a dining destination of choice for most manly men. But no doubt that the guys who have eaten here will tell you that the food is pretty amazing.Farm-to-table food is dished up here, and there is not one thing on the menu that won't tantalize your taste buds. I had such a hard time deciding what to get, and after looking around at other tables and digging deep into my own cravings, I decided to order their Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes with goat cheese and basil beurre blanc. Wow, was this decadent! It's saucey, which I wasn't expecting, so it was a bit rich. But the combination of ingredients were delicious and I ate every last bite. The salads that my friends had looked fantastic as well, and portions were huge. I was also eying the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart and their signature strawberry chicken salad, but unfortunately, I'll have to wait for my next trip back to AZ to taste them. Of course, we had to make room for dessert. You must not skip their desserts! Again, everything sounded wonderful, but we went with a carrot baby cake and a coconut baby cake. Don't be misled - these cakes are not bite size. We had to take at least half of each home because they were so big. A beautiful setting for a lovely lunch, and if it's gorgeous out, try to snag one of their patio tables out back. It's places like these that make me wish I was a professional lady who lunches!um wowi was a bit nervous trying this place for lunch since everyone says it's so slow but we took a risk and we told our waitress we were on a lunch break. she was so awesome about it! we were in and out of there in an hour, with to-go iced teas to boot. seriously awesome! like, so awesome we went twice in a row. this is a frequenter.i had the roasted chicken with tomatoes, spinach and artichoke with a side salad. it was delicious. my friend had the mushroom and chicken crepes which she said were insane. and our other friend had the shrimp salad, also good. but from my eyes i would say my meal and the crepe meal looked the most delicious. i wish my backyard looked like their patio. im going to spend the rest of my afternoon pretending i'm still out there relaxing.I can't remember the last time I've had such a picturesque brunch. The patio at Arcadia Farms is absolutely beautiful, and it almost reminded me of the times I had brunch in Key West (which, trust me, is definitely a good thing.) Our group of six grabbed a round table on the patio under a huge tree, and it almost felt like we were brunching in a treehouse. In case you can't already tell, I really loved my experience here.The coffee was strong and much-appreciated after a long travel day the day before, and the iced tea had something fruity going on which was quite refreshing. The menu is pretty big and I was happy to see so many unique items. And can we just talk about the warm strawberry shortcake? I wanted to, but I decided to be "good" and go with something a little healthier.I ordered the mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese, and added tomato and spinach. I loved how fresh everything was and how generous they were with the vegetables! I subbed fruit for the potatoes but they gave me both (dammit.) I ended up being happy to have a few potatoes along with the great spread of fruit. It was a really healthy, happy & colorful way to start the day! Service was a bit slow but this isn't a place you go to for a quick meal. Visit, enjoy, and definitely score a seat on the patio.Awesome place. I hope to visit again sometime soon for that cake!I had a lovely Sunday lunch at Arcadia Farms Cafe with my husband and two friends, during a weekend visit to Phoenix. It was a charming little restaurant, with the feel of a rich old white lady's house--greenery and white picket fences outside, white furniture, white tablecloths, and gingham prints inside. The vibe was calm and relaxing in an upscale kind of way--like this would be a great place for a fancy tea party. I had a glass of red sangria with my lunch, and that felt right, too.The food was excellent--fresh, clean, farm-to-table kind of fare. We ordered some warm brie with caramelized apples to share, and this was a wonderful appetizer, the cheese baked soft and gooey, the apples the perfect sweetness, all served with crusty toasted baguette. I got the roasted salmon "super" salad for my lunch, and it was perfectly executed. The salmon was ideally moist and flaky, and it came over a bed of farro, kale, radicchio, red onion, chickpeas, and cherry tomato, with a tarragon dressing. I loved all the textures, and every element was inherently flavorful. I very rarely order salads for meals, but this was one I'd get again and again. My husband got a modified ham and cheese sandwich (the kitchen graciously made it more kid-friendly for my 32-year-old boy) with the potato salad on the side, which I ate with enthusiasm. It was a phenomenally good potato salad, with firm, fingerling potatoes in a flavorful dill dressing.Arcadia Farms is across the street from the Poisoned Pen bookstore, which is my destination whenever I come to Phoenix. I'm happy to have a go-to place for lunch in the area, and look forward to my next Arcadia Farms meal.
Jack In the Box=I infrequently go to Jack in the Box. Don't get me wrong; Jack in the Box makes great burgers, sandwiches and sides.But the only time I'll go to Jack's is in the wintertime, in which they featured the Pumpkin Pie Milkshake and Eggnog Milkshake. And I was craving for the Eggnog Milkshake after my dinner. Another piece of technology I don't see back home is the kiosk booth to place your order for your food. As a substitute of seeing the cashier, you input what you want and how you want your food(s) and/or drink(s) customized. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=MkeNe_5lsNK9CkM4mqZMKgAnd the large $2.99 seasonal milkshake is programmed in the machine. You can even request for extra whipped cream and extra maraschino cherry as one many options. I slide my Visa to pay for my treat and I get my receipt with the order number. My milkshake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=ymC0PFMYFXXeOjZgd5QH9wAfter a few minutes, the clerk yelled out my number and I finally got my milkshake. One sip of the thick seasonal milkshake, I was instantly in the holiday spirit.Ladies and Gentlemen: that is technology in Las Vegas!
Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar=Holy mother of god!!  What an outstanding meal THAT was!!!  Thanks to Susan R for hooking me up w/ the link for $50 off cuz I probably wouldn't have tried this place out if I didn't have it.  You could easily spend $100 by yourself.  The guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine, crab cakes, osso buco and the crepes for dessert.  He also inhaled the whole damn thing but that's another story....How can you possibly beat homemade pasta???  You can't.  We opted for the pasta sampler for the appetizer which consisted of gnocchi, ravioli and risotto. I've never had gnocchi so tender.My wife went with their version of frutti di mare which was amazing and I went with the squid ink pasta w/ clams.  Did I mention how good fresh pasta is???The waiter even brought us a couple small desserts on the house which consisted of a small tiramisu and cannoli which was really cool of them.I guess the only thing that would hold me back from coming back here would be the price.  I'd be interested to see how it is for lunch.  I know we'll go back again before the coupon expires.  This is definitely the best Italian I've had in Vegas.Was very excited to visit Ferraro's for the first time last night.  Although I've lived in Vegas for 17 years, I've never been to Ferraro's.A good friend was hosting a party there to celebrate the launch of his new company.  For hors d'oeuvre we were served slices of Cheese Pizza, Sausage Pizza, Risotto Balls, and Sausage w/Marinara Sauce.....all of them were awesome.Once we were seated, we were served Gnocchi w/Marinara Sauce & Penne Pasta with Bolognese Sauce for Appetizers.  For a Salad we were served a salad w/Heirloom Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar, Avocado, and Red Onion.....this was soooo good too!  For an Entree, I chose the Filet w/Wild Mushrooms in a Veal demi-glaze reduction while the Better Half chose the Fresh Seabass.....a couple of friends ordered Ferraro's World Famous Oso Buco......we loved them all!And to finish the dinner, we had Tiramisu & Cannolis....what!!!  I think I died and went to heaven!Plus the wine was free flowing all night long.....I can't remember how many glasses I put away.....ha!I hate to sound like such a Homer, but this was a really really good experience from beginning to end.Will I return?  F-U-H-G-E-T-T-A 'B-O-U-T I-T!Want a mouth orgasm? Ferraro's will give it to you, and give it to you good!Finally tried Ferraro's for lunch with my gal pal. Lunch special 11-4 $9.95!We started off with an Appetizer Arancini Tartufo, rizoto filled fried balls MMMMMMMMMMM YUMMY!I ordered the Salmon, very good, moist and delicious!My friend had the Chicken Vesuvio, must have been good she wiped her plate clean with her last piece of bread, lolOur meals came with a delicious house salad, scrumptious!Bread basket is a winner, comes with Olive Oil and garlic spread.They have sweetened Iced Tea! Yeah baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The service was fantastic!Peter was our Server and he rocked! He really is a kick ass server! They are lucky to have him!Will be back for sure!HAPPY HOUR...yes they have one! 4-7 and 10pm-2am in the lounge and bar!This is a great restaurant for a first date!I added a few photo's of our visit.It's all about the lunch specials here.  Fantastic spaghetti and meatballs with a salad lightly dressed in a yummy balsamic vinaigrette for only $10.  The pizza I had was good, not great.  I appreciate the different size pours of wine offered.  Other restaurants should follow suit.Excellent!  Love this place. My former "go-to" place was La Scala.  However if you want a special meal, try Ferraro's.a. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.b.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.c.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.d.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.e.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu. I love coming here and will continue as the food and service are great.Came here for restaurant week!Semi casual Italian restaurant, off the strip, that caters to locals!  Not sure if they offer the menu at 1/2 price for locals year round, but during our visit it was still going on!  That's EVERYTHING on the regular menu at half price for locals!We supplemented the RW menu with Calamari Fritti ($15 / $7.50 for locals): Fried calamari and Spicy Tomato Sauce. This was good, very tender pieces of squid. Lightly breaded with not much flavor/seasoning...almost plain!  Wish these was a bit more zing/kick in the flavor dept.The Complimentary bread...nothing crazy here, but the pesto/olive oil combo was nice.  I dipped the calamari in it to add flavor lol.Tasting of Agnolotti : Ravioli Filled with Spinach, Mascarpone, Ricotta, Mortadella, and Tear-Drop Tomato Sauce. Good, but wish there was more to the tasting lol.  They gave up one ravioli, so it was a pretty light portion.Tasting of Gnocchi Bolognese : House Made Potato Dumplings with Bologna Meat Sauce. This was perfect! The dumplings were super soft, tender and meat sauce was flavorful! This was the highlight of the night for me actually, and I would come back for this dish alone!  Gnocchi doesn't usually do too much for me, but this actually wow'd me!Mista del Casa: Mixed Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette. This was actually pretty good, coming from someone that doesn't enjoy eating salad lol. Simple but flavorful salad.Caprese di Bufala: Bufala Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil, Pine Nuts, Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil. I only tasted the Mozzarella, which was good. Not my kind of dish.For main entrees, Osso Buco ($45 or $22.50 for locals): The House Specialty, Veal Shank Braised in Red Wine Reduction and Faro. This was super tender, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth! Sauce was a good consistency, but a bit rich...couldn't finish it!  Tried the bone marrow...ok, but I guess I am not a huge marrow fan.Pollo Piccata: Chicken Breast, Capers, Lemon, Butter and White Wine. Good chicken, a bit heavy on the capers with a strong mustard taste, but good overall.And for dessert, a Tasting of Tiramisu and Cannoli. Tiramisu wasn't overly strong tasting, but good overall. Cannoli had a crisp shell and light filling...good! Service was very friendly, and our waiter even entertained Little Foodie Dude while he ate :PPrices would be great if you are local, and fair if you aren't...just not as much bang for your buck on certain dishes.  Go with the pasta since everything is made in house!  Give em a try :PPics :My bf had gotten a restaurant.com certificate a while back and we finally made a date to go and try out Ferraro's. I love going out to fancy dinners and splurging every so often so I was super excited. Basically, the ambiance and food were awesome, but the service was so blah that I just couldn't enjoy the restaurant much.We arrived right on time and were seated right away. Our server came over and my bf showed him the certificate, but he told us they had stopped taking them. We said we didn't know because restaurant.com usually informs you if that happens with a certificate you've purchased. We were not rude or upset with the server at all and in fact were totally nice about it. After that little exchange, he basically treated us like we didn't exist. We had checked in on Yelp and saw that there was an appetizer offer for checking in and didn't even feel comfortable bringing it up as he had seemed so annoyed about the restaurant.com certificate.I think this sums up everything he said to us that night: "Wine? (takes our order) Great." And then later, "Ready to order? (takes order) Great." And once we were done with our meals, "Dessert or are you done?" To which we replied, "we are super full, so ready for the check whenever." And that's it. When he dropped off the check after running our card, he didn't even say thank you for coming in or have a nice night or anything. Just dropped it off quickly on his way to another table. Needless to say, I don't even need to go into details about the food, but I will say that one of my fave places is Gaetano's in Henderson, which has a swanky romantic ambiance and the food is even better AND the service is TOP NOTCH. You always feel welcome and greeted warmly by the owners, unlike Ferraro's.I always know that if I ask for a recommendation for good Italian food from a cabby from MA (Hey, Mike!) that I won't be led astray. My mom and I were looking for some chow before we went to see Divas last Saturday and ended up at Ferraro's. It's in a strip mall, but do not let that fool you. I've only been to one other restaurant, ever, whose service rivaled theirs. Our very helpful and welcoming waiter, Eric, made our dinner such a treat! He also gave us really great tips on what to order, and I must say that although it was so out of the ordinary for me, I could not have been more pleased. BREAD. It needs to be in all caps because up until this meal I'd been forgoing all gluten....but when they sat the basket of warm focaccia and rolls in front of us with the tangy balsamic/oil dipping sauce I knew I was in trouble. There was no way I wasn't going to eat it and can I just say that I don't regret not one bite! The focaccia is buttery and crispy and chewy...all of my favorite things. The rolls were crunchy on the outside and perfectly airy and chewy on the inside. The oil & vinegar didn't last long. I almost licked the dish. I also ordered a side of their marinara since our main dish wasn't marinara based. So delicious....I can imagine the pasta dishes where that is used are out of this world.We started with the Beef Carpaccio. It is served with a bed of arugula and fresh Parmesan cheese atop and then Eric squeezed half of a lemon on top of the whole thing and rolled it up for us. I just don't even know how to explain to you how delicious this dish is. Simple, flavorful, and I didn't want it to end. While I was in the ladies' room, my mom ordered the grilled octopus salad. I can only imagine that Eric recommended the dish as my mom would never, ever order octopus on her own! I was a little worried until it was brought out and I got my first bite. It is served cold, diced up with other amazing things that I am blanking out on at the moment, but it was all perfect together. Interesting texture to get used to, but oh so very tasty. We shared the Pappardelle Mimmo which is long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, and truffle. So decadent but they also do such a great job of not overwhelming the dishes with any one flavor. This was a celebratory dinner and it couldn't have been more of a success. Eric took such good care of us along with the rest of the army of servers who made sure we never had an empty glass.There's not a lot to not heart about Ferraro's. There's not really a reason to read this review either since you can tell that everyone is telling you... GO! Pros:- Perfect for a date, no matter what age- Fancy pants enough to have a bathroom attendant?!- Clean!Cons:- Erm, like none? Service - 5/5. Staff was beyond wonderful. Just genuine, warm vibes through and through. People here to treat you with kindness because they're just good people, not ONLY because they're here to make some money. (Which is a great way to earn even more of my money, too.)Happy Hour Food- - Wine is 25% off! - House bread- 5/5 Ohhhhhhh you need this. One of the best I've ever had.- Beet salad- 5/5 Fabulous flavors! - Calamari- 3/5 pretty generic. Comes with a sweeter sauce.- Caesar salad- 4/5 pretty plating. Whole leaf served- Pizza with prosciutto (forgot the name!)- 5/5 super delicious.- Meatballs with polenta- 4/5So in summary... I don't have much to say about the HH except that all of the bites were wonderful. Come here with some friends, and look forward to a good night.Items Selected:Focaccia and Ciabatta with Olive Oil and CaponataArancini with Truffles and Polpettine with Finger Fried PolentaAffettati e Formaggio - Imported Italian meat and cheeses, olives, marinated vegetablesSpicy Eggplant Risotto Caprese - Italian Arborio rice, tomato, ricotta cheese, black olive powderCapellini Puttanesca - House made angel hair, fresh tomato sauce, black olives, capers, anchoviesGnocchi al Pesto - House made potato dumplings, creamy basil pesto sauceAgnolotti - House made ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, light tear-drop tomato sauceArtichoke Spaghetti with Brown Butter, Caviar, and CinnamonTrippa Satriano - tripe in spicy tomato sauceConiglio Brasato - Braised farm raised rabbit, sauteed spinachOsso Buco - Veal shank braised in red wine reduction served with farroFlourless Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Mousse, StrawberriesTiramisuTold that Mimo Ferraro's recent focus on Pizza Forte had given way to a new Chef with skills set to further improve the cuisine at local legend Ferraro's Italian Kitchen, it was with expectations of rustic Italian done 'right' that four friends sat down to dinner at the storied space on Paradise, and with top notch service that saw visits from both Chef Francesco di Caudo and Gino Ferraro the four-course family style tasting was everything that was anticipated, a few 'gifts from the kitchen' showing signs of things to come while classics came through loud and clear.In many ways a 'locals' spot, in part due to the heritage but also as result of location and Sin City's celebrity chef culture, entrance to Ferraro's is met by jovial greetings at the podium and with a bar plus outdoor patio on the left as the low-lit dining room sits to the right the feeling is at once familiar but also intimate - the white linens, candles, and rose on each table all building on an atmosphere less-and-less frequently seen in modern dining realm. Navigating a menu steeped in heritage, many 'signatures' outlined while seasonal notes decorate a large collection of house-made pastas, it was with a basket of warm bread with oil atop caponata that the two-and-a-half hour meal began and with a bottle of white from the well-priced list soon poured for some a duo of sliced truffle alongside meatballs and polenta proved a decadent opening duo, both notably available as part of the 4-7pm happy hour in the lounge at a fraction of the a la carte price.Transitioning to Antipasti, the well sourced Affettati e Formaggio was presented as a veritable bargain at $18 with mortadella, prosciutto, and speck all shining alongside crumbly Pecorino and rich Gorgonzola, but acknowledging that none of these items are made on-site the true star was actually bowl of Mrs. Ferraro's sliced eggplant, an in-the-know sort of item served at the request of one diner that saw the oft-fried ingredient breathed new life through vinegar, sugar, and black pepper - each bite delicious on its own, but all the moreso when used taken as a poignant foil to the charcuterie's meaty sapor.Joking that an Italian Tasting Menu mostly means the chef will send out more pasta, round three featured a quartet of primi plated tasting-style by the kitchen plus a bowl of pasta created at the Sicilian Chef's whim, and although the risotto unfortunately came off a bit undercooked the four house-made noodles were undoubtedly amongst the best in the city, the signature Puttanesca not nearly as briny as one may guess from the ingredients while both gnocchi and agnolotti were tender bites of decadence, the artichoke pasta marrying discrepant flavors with brown butter a truly dynamic dish that hopefully represents a sign of evolution from a kitchen already well versed in the things it has long done well.Sticking entirely to signatures for secondi it would seem obvious that no meal at Ferraro's should end without the city's most storied Osso Buco, and carved tableside by Gino with no more than a fork and spoon the tender meat in rich wine was just as good as rumor would have it, a compliment no less applicable to juicy braised rabbit served alongside lemony wilted spinach or the best tripe dish I've encountered stateside in quite some time, each supple bite rife rife with texture while the spicy sauce served to highlight the offal's intrinsic flavor rather than hide it like so many others.Perhaps mistakenly allowing the kitchen to decide upon dessert it was with a rather mundane chocolate cake that the evening was originally set to end, but having heard rumor of a tiramisu not to be missed a slice was requested along with four spoons, the sizable $12 wedge every bit as textbook as the menu's other classics with a delicate balance of mascarpone and cinnamon overlying feather-light ladyfingers ever so faintly accented with coffee and a the slightest hint of liquor.Four of us got together to try several dishes at Ferraro's.  Shortly after being seated, we were brought drinks and we took awhile to peruse the menu to agree on the items we all wanted to try.  We were brought a bread basket with ciabatta and focaccia.  We then ordered the following:House made meatball with a fried stick of polenta and a rice ballImported Italian meats and cheesesSpicy eggplantRisotto with Italian arborio rice, tomato, ricotta cheese, black olive powderPesto gnocchiCapellini puttanescaArtichoke spaghetti with caviar and cinnamonHouse made ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, light tear-drop tomato sauceTripe in spicy tomato sauceOsso buco with farroFarm raised rabbit with sautéed spinachFlourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and strawberriestiramisuNoting we were sharing dishes, the house opted to serve our appetizers and initial four pastas on separate plates with a small serving of each.  The imported meat and cheese plate on the menu as affettati e formaggio was outstanding with a good selection of meats and cheeses.  Along with this, the off menu item, sliced eggplant was excellent.  We then moved to the pastas.  The risotto was not cooked enough and was chewy.  The pesto gnocchi and house made ravioli with spinach, ricotta, mascarpone, and mortadella were the standouts.  The puttanesca was also good.  A fifth pasta was brought, an interesting and very tasty spaghetti with artichoke, caviar, cinnamon, and brown butter.  I never expected cinnamon and pasta to be together but it worker very well with the butter and caviar.For the main course items, the peppery tripe and osso buco were excellent.  Their menu notes that the tripe is "awesome" which it is.We finished with two desserts--a flourless chocolate cake and chocolate mousse with strawberries.  This was OK but we ordered one more dessert--tiramisu.  It was excellent.  Soft in texture and not overrun with alcohol, this was a perfect ending, along with a double espresso over ice--to a very delightful two and a half hour dinner with good friends.Service was excellent during the meal.  The individual plating of some of our dishes made sharing easy but sometimes the food appeared lost on the very large plates.  During the second half of the meal, the servers opened the extenders on four sides of the round table so we had more room.
Hometown Buffet=Owned by the same parent company as Old Country, and much of the same food, but just not as good (or should I say not as mediocre?)This location is close to my job and they give a 20% discount if i show my badge, so I end up here sometimes even though it's not so great.The food's ready to grab and eat, so that works well for lunch hour.The digs are showing their age and wear and tear, but most of the bussers seem to keep things tidied up (as they try to earn a tip from you, even though they don't even get you drinks anymore)Pretty much everything here used to be better a few years ago.  The last several visits I've encountered things like wilted spinach one visit only to have my complaint remedied by NO spinach on the next couple visits.  That's what i get for being picky i guess!Your lunch here will consist of such delicacies as cheese enchiladas, cheese pizza, macaroni & cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn bread, spaghetti, chicken dumplings, soup, jello, and an iceberg/romaine lettuce mix, and a few other things.  'tsabout it....day in and day out, with an occaisional 'teriyaki' chicken & white rice or grade-school-cafeteria-grade 'meat' patty on dried bun, or something like that thrown in to keep you on your toes.They used to offer both ice cream and yogurt in soft serve machines, but usually it's only one or neither.  Just like the main courses and sides, the dessert selection just isn't what it used to be.The creme brulee and prime rib must be held back until the weekend when they charge that $2 more.
Slices=Any place with a boisterous Bostonian as an owner and Red Sox memorabilia plastered on the walls automatically makes me a fan. The fact that their pizza is delicious makes me an even bigger fan. All these people who say the counter service is rude have obviously never been to Boston, and cannot appreciate the assholeic nature of its inhabitants. I mean, do you really think the people who are taking your order really give a shit about how you're doing? I don't. Anyway, I ordered 8 pizzas for the office the other day and tried 3 different kinds, yes I can slaughter an ungodly amount of pizza, and I don't care about the repercussions. Call me a fat kid if you want.. The crust is perfection. The cheese, oh god, the cheese is a mouthgasm, the toppings are all fresh and delicious and the slices are HUGE. They also sell em by the slice @ $3.25, but considering what I just said, its totally fair. They have a potato, bacon and cheese kind that I am dying to try, and since lunch is in an hour and its a 45 second walk away, I'm probably going to go satisfy my craving... and then some... My only complaint is that they don't deliver.. but other than that, its wicked pissah.much like my eriberto's review there are certain guidelines and codes of conduct that are associated with Slices; and while i am currently a little too lazy to make an in depth crack at it here's the jist:steps to properly enjoy pizza at slices1. drown yourself in alcohol;   slices is only tolerable if thoroughly drunk, otherwise thoughts like "i wonder how long these have been sitting out under those heat lamps for" or "why is my pizza cold" or "why does this taste strange" will pop into your head, ruining your meal.2. don't bring your girlfriend here;    not only will she think you're a cheap dicknose but she'll look down on you for your horrible taste, and as a cautionary tale there is usually a minimum of 3-5 complete bromosexual pseudo-alpha males here decked out in their matching affliction shirts and amped up on enough cheap domestic light beer/red bull/anabolic steroids to make Danny Bonaducci look normal, just in case you might not want your special lady friend oggled&harassed.3. avoid at all costs;   but if absolutely necessary to eat here- choose a meat free option.   my detractors will wish they'd heeded my words when they're crouched over the commode spewing up that bacteria infested pepperoni the next day.All in all, with the various pizza options in the area;-Otto's-Tessio's-Spinato's-La Bocca-Venezia'swhy would you eat this garbage?
Native New Yorker=I recently had drinks and food with friends here. The service was awful! It took over 40 minutes to get my 2nd drink. In addition, they forgot two food orders. When I spoke with the manager he offered to take the items off my bill. I told him I will pay for the items I got. I was so frustrated because I just wanted him to listen to my complaint and he only kept throwing out excuses.
Garden Court Buffet=Yay! I'm a fan.Thank you fellow yelpers for the spot on reviews of this place.Cheap,decent and friendly. Best downtown buffet? I'm on a mission to find out!Main Street Station, tucked away behind the Cal (California Casino) and right next to the Plaza, is one of the nicer casinos on or near Fremont Street in Downtown..  What I usually do is park my car at the Cal, get a good 4 hr validation and walk over to Main Street for the buffet via the skywalk to save time, money, and avoid the heat by walking outside...  Main Street has a parking lot but it's outdoors, so I prefer Cal's option much better...So...when I was younger I remember going to Circus Circus to have their super cheap buffet!  (for those of you near Vegas I'm sure you've been there and done that too!  Circus Circus was the bomb when we were kids and thought the buffet was great until we grew up and out of it)  Well, Main Street offers a buffet that has the price of Circus Circus, but the food is actually comparable to those on the strip.  Granted it's no Bellagio but food is probably as good as I say Harrah's, Monte Carlo, etc... so it's definitely no slouch when it comes to the quality.  Went during the weekend for Sunday Brunch and it cost us $10.99 with free flowing mimosa if requested!So what makes this place that good?  First, the decor...  For a downtown casino it's got a grand feel to the buffet as it has a really nice european setting...  A few statues here, 30 ft high ceiling with stained glasses and windows, I believe there may also be a fountain inside the buffet, etc... real nice touch!The buffet layout was very nice as well.. wide open, lots of seating, easy buffet lines to get your food as the line goes from right to left starting with salads and ends with desserts.Variety was also terrific as they had everything from salads, pizza, soup, 3 varieties of eggs, country fried steak, roast chicken, steam corn, omelette station, bbq ribs, enchiladas, nachos, orange chicken, bbq pork buns, lau lau pork, etc.... a wide variety which I couldn't name them all but selection is awesome for it's price....Here are the notables..... prime rib brisket was off the hook!  Meat looked dry yet when it gets into your mouth it literally falls apart... Roast chicken was moist like it just took a shower without much oil (which should be the case), lau lau pork has a terrific smokey flavor which I have not had in other Hawaiian places making it a very nice treat, and some chicken wing dishes (Asian) had the most juiciest chicken wings available!  Just overall a awesome meal when you are not thinking of paying $20+ on the strip as this is a great alternative.  They even have ice cream cones you can self serve and the vanilla ice cream was tasty yet not overly sweet.  A great end to a nice meal!Service provided were pretty superb as well.  Our drinks were consistently topped and plates were removed promptly so there were no complaints here.  So guarantee worth your $14 with tip!One fun side note.. after eating do make sure you visit the restroom at this place...(I'm thinking of washing your hands after the meal what were you thinking???)  But for the guys restroom do take a look at a piece of Berlin wall that is used to hold up the urinals.  It's sort of all to see a piece of history while you do your business....  Only in Vegas!Hmm. I don't really know how to review this place. We came this morning for the champagne brunch with a pretty large party. The line was pretty long, but it went quickly and they were able to seat us relatively fast considering the size of our party. There were many pros to this buffet. Once seated, our server quickly took our drink orders and we were able to go get our food. They have a pretty good variety of options and it's organized well. There seemed to be something for everything. The food was ok as well. Now, onto the con and it's one heck of a con. I unfortunately caught sight of a roach on the line, right on the waffle, biscuit and corned beef hash station and that obviously stopped my appetite in it's tracks. That's unforgivable in my book, I won't be back.A long time ago a certain Pineapple clad Yelper told me about this buffet. He insisted that I should try it the next time I'm in Vegas. I did and have been taking family and friends here since.So it's already cheap right? You can make it even cheaper by signing up for their player's card and getting the 2 for 1 deal.I've been here for their Champagne Brunch. Pretty standard selection but good enough to satisfy your morning cravings. The champagne is free flowing and you can always order a side of orange juice to make your own mimosa!Filipino tip: They have ox tail at the far end of the Asian section. My family loved it and said it tasted like "kare kare". And if you're familiar with that dish, might be worth giving a try. They also kept saying how the oxtail was worth the price of the buffet alone.Service was pretty good. The servers are on top of refilling drinks and taking plates away. So if you're looking for a cheap, no frills buffet outside the Strip, give this one a try.UNPREDICTABLE QUALITY =2.5 STARS What had been a rewarding relationship with the Garden Court Buffet (abbreviated GCB)  has become volatile and unpredictable. On its good days, GCB is a reasonably priced buffet serving decent (not great) food. Excluding themed buffet nights, $10.99 with a Boyd card is a sweet deal for a buffet in downtown Las Vegas that is walking distance to the Fremont Street Experience. A handful of my Fremont Street Experience adventures plus two visits to the IRS were anchored by dining experiences at GCB. Although the GCB selection has trailed behind many of the popular Las Vegas buffets, there was always a few delicacies to reward my taste buds. I have enjoyed their meat loaf, salmon, lasagna, rice pilaf, miso soup, and Asian foods station. A sweet dessert would top off the experience.   With any volatile relationship, the bad days pull you away. Yesterday was one of my few bad experiences here. And it is a shame because it was my day off and I just happened to have my mind set on topping off an afternoon in downtown at the GCB. This experience started off promising. By 5:30 pm, a line to the cashier had developed. Being proactive, management opened two cashier stations leading to a smooth transition to the host then table. From there, I might as well been as present as a utensil to the server. It took a while for him to acknowledge me. Finally he'd bring me my two glasses of Pepsi then pass over checking up on me afterwards. When I was on the buffet cues is when he'd clear off my table (small portions on my plate).  Near the end of the meal I'd give up on waiting around for him to ask me if I wanted coffee,  if he would of even done that. But forget about the service, I was disappointed with the food.    Supposedly this had been coined the Best Buffet in Vegas. I tend to disagree. I have dined here on and off for nearly a decade and no way this was the Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Today GCB is supposedly one of the top five buffets in Las Vegas according to their advertisement. No way! Right off the bat I could say that better buffets include Carnival, Red Rock, The Orleans, Boulder Station, and South Pointe. And if you add the higher priced buffets in the Bellagio category, GCB falls lower on the Las Vegas Buffet totem pole. On its good days it has been simply "good."    There are a few reasons why yesterday I was disappointed with the food. First off, sushi which is  currently my favorite buffet food was nonexistent. No sushi whatsoever. Boo! Then there was no peeled shrimp. Ditto for the meatloaf. The fish was unappealing. Celery spoiled the taste of the rice pilaf. Not much choices at the Asian foods station, which is my current second favorite buffet station. On a bright note there was miso soup. Disappointingly , the miso soup that I have relished in the past was now dull and a few degrees short of the warm temperature of how I prefer my soup. Regardless I'd fill up on miso soup. A complaint I have with their miso soup is that the soup cups are not much larger than the ones that you put cocktail sauce in when there are peeled shrimp. With my options running out, I'd place spaghetti on my nearly empty plate. If this is supposed to be the fifth best buffet in Las Vegas, how come they skimp over meatballs? Why did it taste like can pasta?  And why would I go back here in the foreseeable future?   My relationship with GCP has become volatile and unpredictable . The way I see it, you live once. If you live once, why settle for unpredictable experiences? It has come to the point that I will now separate from GCB for at least six months.Very solid buffet for the price! I have come here for normal dinner nights, prime rib dinner on Saturday as well as champagne brunch on the weekends. Price is great for a buffet and the selection is decent. Tucked away in Main Street Station, the buffet is directly next to the cashier. It's pretty hard to miss. Make sure you are a B-Connected player's club member to get a discounted price. My favorite is the champagne brunch. All you can drink champagne and all you can eat brunch food? Love love love. Like I said, the selection is decent, but other buffets on the Strip definitely have the upper hand here. That is the only downfall imo about this place.Located inside the Main Street Station Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas, I was curious to try this place out and I must say that this place left me quite impressed. In a very good way!I managed to get there in time for their dinner buffet. For only $14 each, myself and my foodie date got to enjoy quite the cuisine they had to offer. I had to start off immediately with a plate of spaghetti paired with a garlic bread slice and chicken wings. For beverages, I had their pink lemonade which was not too sweet but just right! For my second helping, I had their chicken taquitos, dirty rice and a taco I made out of ground beef. Very good in taste! Since I was trying to not get too stuffed, I had to opt for dessert, which to my surprise, they had one of my all time favorite desserts- key lime pie! Had to grab a slice!Inside it is very roomy with a very lovely décor. It would kind of remind you of the décor that you would expect to find in a restaurant off the Strip. Since we arrived a few minutes early for dinner, there was already a long line. If you are a card member, your meal will run for less, maybe a dollar or two cheaper. They also have a very well known seafood buffet, which we did not have time to check out. Servers were very attentive to filling my beverages. I overall had such a great time here and my experience was very pleasant. Just come prepared with your fat pants, as you will be feeling very full with quite the variety of eats. From pizza to fried yams to spaghetti to salads to pork chops and fresh fruit, they got it all. Already become one of my favorite buffets when I decide to come visit Downtown Las Vegas next time!Came here for dinner. I'm not used to eating buffets anymore. I normally snack throughout the day. Been feeling more dehydrated than normal cause of the heat. I ended up drinking more than eating. The trick is to eat first and then drink if you eat at a buffet. I remember coming here way before I started Yelping with my now mother in law. This place is descent and offers a wide variety of food including pizza for the most pickiest eaters like my daughter. I thought I could handle more food but I only had one plate that consists of fried chicken, corn on the cob, grilled fish, sausage and rice. Rice was mushy. Blah. Chicken was good. A little dry but the skin was crunchy. Fish and sausage was good. The fish had a mild flavor. Sausage was flavorful. I had to save room for dessert. I had a chocolate cream pie which was sugar free but I also grabbed a couple of smaller desserts. One was a strawberry rolled cake with coconut on top and a chocolate fudge with a very rich frosting. It was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. Too sweet! Service was great. The waiter refilled our drinks and cleared our table once he saw the empty plates. I really like how attentive he was! The place was very spacious and had plenty of room to move around and grab food as you walk back to your table. It was an okay dining experience.
Chuy's Mesquite Broiler=Once upon a time I was a young lad with a powerful hunger for life and meat. I used to love going to Chuy's. Tri tip sammiches FTW I would have pronounced had FTW not still carried the Tupac meaning back when I liked it...yeah the good ol days. How the mighty have fallen.After a trip to Ikea that went a bit too late to get my lingonberry fix, my companion and I were famished. One of the first places my navigation brought up in the area was  Chuy's. Hey right on, my generation digs nostalgia. The folks working were nice enough...I love the idea of serve yourself all you can eat chips and salsa, I forgot they have a bar, hey things are looking good....until.I don't know if the stale chips just put me off enough to realize that Chuy's looks like my ex's parents bedroom after they refinanced their house to take out an equity loan in order to make their bedroom look like a Margaritaville restaurant. Parrot Heads. They did a half-assed job and so did Chuy's. It lacks the charm I remember the old Metro Center location having.The chips were stale, the salsa was lame, the tri-tip was dry. The service was ok but apparently Wednesday night is the night to visit your buddy who works at Chuy's and get your drink on..I dunno maybe it's just short of payday and you couldn't afford your meds so this seemed like a good idea at the time. Point being I had to (got to?) listen to a loud conversation about a guy's terrible luck. He got pulled over speeding while hauling a trailer that he knew had no lights and got ticketed for everything he was doing wrong, Next day his wife got mad at him and busted a window in their house, later she burned his trailer down, ater again while "partying" he accidently hit the panic button on his friends house alarm causing the police to come to their rescue only to find 3 men with a pile of coke, entertaining a hooker. you aren't unlucky bro, you have bad judgement and worse taste in women.Sigh. If you dragged me to Chuy's I would go I guess...maybe...for childhood Nathan's sake.
Remington's Restaurant=Our first visit to Remington's was on a recent weeknight.  We made reservations but they certainly were not needed as the dining room was nearly empty.  By contrast the bar lounge area was rather busy.  A piano and lounge singer could be heard into the dining room, kind of a nice background that we did enjoy.  Others have raved about this being a classy place.  I sure didn't get that vibe.  It was more 80's dated hotel restaurant than classy to me.We had a very attentive waiter who served us well.  There seemed to be a lot of servers with a lot of busy acitivty, constantly in and out of swinging doors.  There was a large group in a private closed off dining area.  We noticed most patrons were in their Senior years.  Maybe they alternate between here and Charleston's?Between us we ordered steak & grilled salmon with a potato dish to share and a couple of side salads.  The steak was not cooked as requested but we didn't bother to send it back.  Salmon was unremarkable.  The tomato mozzarella salad was abundant but yellow tomatoes were inedible mush and the red tomatoes were just flavorless.  Lyonnaise potatoes were a tad greasy.  Dinners are all ala carte.  Nothing was particularly bad, just nothing to get excited about.  I felt like I was dining in a hotel restaurant, food was delivered with plastic covers like they use in room service dining.  Overall I have to say I was simply underwhelmed.  After reading other reviews I had greater expectations for Remington's.  At a total of $84 (no alcohol) we expected more.  If I were a hotel guest on an expense account, maybe I would have felt differently. For the money, next time I would drive just down the street and go to Ruth's Chris.  We won't be hurrying back to Remington's.If you've got the time, then Remington's is the place.  I made reservations on line for a Wed. night at 7, and they even called to confirm but when we showed up they had no clue who we were.  The maitre de said 'no problem, give me a minute' and then disappeared.  We were left standing for 10 minutes before a hostess came to seat us.  We assumed they were clearing a table and were surprised when we were led into an almost empty dining room.  We were seated and although someone brought us water almost immediately, it was another 10 minutes before our server showed up and asked if we wanted menus!  NO let me guess what you have!  A few minutes later, she came back with the menus and left us alone again.  Assuming this was how the evening was going to go, we decided to skip any appetizers and just order, eat & get out as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, Remington's must have liked our company because it seems they wanted to keep us there for as long as possible.  Our salads arrived promptly at 8 (1 hour after being seated).  Shortly after, someone dropped off a basket of dinner rolls -  butter would have been a nice touch.  We finished our salads and sat waiting for our entrees.  And sat and waited and sat and waited.  At 8:30 our entrees were finally delivered.  We ate our meals and as she was clearing our plates we asked for the check so we could make our exit.  And again we waited.  The time stamp on our receipt shows she rang us up a little after 9 but it was almost 9:30 before we allowed to sign the bill & get out. The one redeeming factor of Remington's is the food.  I had the tomato/onion salad and pork chop while my g/f had the baby spinach salad and shrimp.  All were wonderful and certainly worth the price on the menu, but not worth the time.After looking at the menu and having a groupon burning in my pocket I was pretty excited to try out Remington's Restaurant.  Unfortunately that's as far as the excitement went as far as dining experience went. Pro's:LocationCon's:Fly landing on bread bowlHost's dressed like morgue workersFood comes out with plastic dome's over it to keep warm but really wasn't too warm anywaysFelt very dated inside Server pointed out total before groupon like I was going to stiff him on tip Overall I will not be back and wasn't impressed at all.  I guess if you are staying at the resort it's not a bad choice but I'd still go for a quick drive to one of the many other fine establishments within a short distance.
Uncle Bear's Bar & Grill=I went to lunch with my buddy, Rob M., to a place called Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill. It was actually pretty cool! I was surprised because it is in one of the more LAME areas near my house. Namely "Warner and Cooper".When we entered however, it was anything BUT lame. Dog bowls on all the tables filled with mutant peanuts. Granted, it was lunch, but there really wasn't more than 3 other groups there. This led me to believe the food/service was bad. Not at all! This place rocked!We shared some nachos in a heterosexual kinda way, and shared manly stories about football before shoving off. By the way, Rob, you owe me $15.00!!!
Subway=What the...I was super impressed by this Subway. I tend to reserve four and five stars for places that really exceed my expectations. And fortunately, because I am addicted to Yelp, I find only the best of the best. But what brought my to Subway was the need to feed. On a hot AZ day I was driving around running errands with friends when suddenly I just had to have some lunch. My friend spotted this Subway and while I first thought that finding another option might be better, I didn't see the point in disagreeing. We walked in and were immediately greeted by three smiling employees eager to take our orders. We wanted the same sandwich, split, so they offered to make two sandwiches but give us the low low price of 1 footlong instead of 2 6 inches. This saved us two bucks!The "sandwich artists" were super funny and it was clear that they had been working here a while. They had a good time slapping the ingredients together and really piling on the toppings. I don't live in the area but if I lived closer, I'd come here just for the service. I left here with a smile on my face and a pretty decent sandwich to boot.
El Molino Mexican Cafe=Have I ever shared my issues with microwaves before? I know I am a creep but I really dislike microwaved food. I almost had a meltdown when my expensive green chile burro was placed in the microwave. It was $11 and it's not even fresh? Is it cold? I watched you scoop it onto the tortilla, it wasn't from the fridge and if it wasn't hot to serve......does that mean it was at the perfect temperature for food born bacteria?  Also, don't you know microwaves make tortillas all funky and weird textured? While it was microwaving I was able to check out the dried, crusty filth on all of the appliances: evidence of cooking and not cleaning. Yuck.  I really need to stop looking at stuff like that. Luckily, I was able to talk myself out of being a total nut job and I ate it. I was only able to eat  some of it because 1. it was effing huge and 2. the image of the crusty splatter kept popping into my head. regardless, It was so tasty. My favorite green chile burro used  to be from Espos but I have other issues with Espos.  This burro compares and while not totally clean and it being overpriced... and the fact that they microwaved it....it was really really really good. like good enough for me to give this place 3 stars. I like my green chile burros made with shredded beef, none of that weird cubed meat for me,  and they deliver on that aspect!i honestly don't know if i'm capable of going again, but if you're more hardcore than i am and you are down with the get down, the i say munch up!Looking for quick, moderately priced Mexican in Old Town?El Molino is your answer...It's nothing fancy but it hits the spot.  I've had chips and salsa, guac, a chicken taco salad, and most recently a bean and cheese burro... I hear the breakfast burritos are pretty delicious as well so I may be back soon for some am fuel or to cure a hangover.Either way, El Molino is a step up from fast food but it's no frills.  Oh, and the people in the Yelp office are huge fans... they are the ones that turned me on to it.  (Gracias amigos!)
Metro Pizza=Metro pizza is a Las Vegas locals pizza place. It's NOT cheap but they are pretty consistent.Most recently we had a lunch caterered in at work and everything was quite good.The delivery & setup man was fantastic he made sure we had everything and extra.We ordered the salad, garlic knots, baked ziti and chicken parmesan. The food was hot,cheesy and the chicken had crunch. I couldn't find myself shelling out $40 for pizza & breadsticks but it was a nice treat.For starters, the complimentary fresh baked sourdough loaf bread and butter basket is a nice treat!Mmmmmm yummy I love Metro Pizza. The Decatur and Flamingo location is cozy and fun always a nice experience!The Service is Fantastic every time I have dined here and I am unsure why I am now just submitting my review for this Awesome pizza and Pasta place?Mmmmm yum what we ordered this time around was a Sicilian sub, spicy shrimp pasta and baked ziti.The jam packed Sicilian sub was great and set on home hearth baked bread it just melts in your mouth!The baked ziti loaded up with sauce, mozzarella and ricotta cheese it was the best!The portions are very generous as you are guaranteed to be leaving with leftovers for another meal!I have always had their pizza in the past which is very good however this is the first time I ordered a pasta dinner and am so happy I did!!!The Spicy shrimp pasta was divine, the sauce spicy and so flavorful the perfect mix of goodness! The big shrimp mixed in as well was very good and all tied in with angel hair pasta. Soooo good and my boyfriend loved it as well because we shared both of our dishes.We even saved $12 bucks off of our meal with an Entertainment book buy one dinner entree get one free. That is insane considering what the portion of the pasta dinners are!The service is always Stellar!!!See posted pics! Enjoy!Do you have any idea how good the pizza is here?On a scale of 1-10, it is a 9.5.  I am only holding out because we have a Tony's Little Italy Pizza in Placentia, Ca. that ranks a 10 in my book.We have been coming here for years, whenever we find ourselves in Las Vegas.  I think this may be the original location.  There is a decent amount of seating, not really huge, and bright, cheerful, NY ambiance.We usually order the extra thick crust, but we were trying to cut down our carbs this time around, so went with a thin crust.  I loved it's thin "crustiness"  with cornmeal base, and would definitely do it again.But....our real downfall was the fresh out of the oven, hot Italian bread with sesame seeds.  Fabulous tasting, it has a crumbly crust and the most tender insides you can imagine. They brought out a soup bowl of their amazing marinara sauce (I ended up drinking it like soup when everyone else was done) for dipping, and lots of butter.  I think I like the less acidic marinara even better than the pizza sauce.  Either way, you will be tripping over your feet trying to come back just for that.The good Italian sausage with fennel seed, cheese, pepperoni, and fresh mushroom is our standard order.  It never disappoints.  A large size gives you 8 large slices.They kept the Coke coming, and it was free with a Yelp check-in.  Even refilled our marinara bowl.  Such piggies we were.  No leftovers. We walked away full and happy, 4 of us for ~ $30 including one generous glass of house red wine for Mr. B. Happy to share this with you!Items Selected:Warm Housemade Bread and ButterMeatball Sliders and Garlic Romano Fries - Housemade Meatballs, Melted Provolone, Soft Garlic Knots with Marinara SauceFried Metro Calzone - Pizza Dough, Ricotta, Mozzarella, Romano Cheese, SpicesThe Cicero Stuffed Pizza - Meatballs, Ricotta, MozzarellaCannoli, Carrot Cake, Red Velvet Cheesecake, and Chocolate Fudge Layer CakeTold of a fried calzone that can be special requested whenever owner John Arena is present at any of the Metro Pizza locations, and perhaps occasionally even when he is not, it was on the invitation of the pizza-guru himself that my family stopped by the spot on Decatur for a lunch featuring the crispy golden pockets, a few additional items again proving the high quality of the local chain's wares.Decked out with a Mid-80's Miami Vice sort of vibe, the retro décor apparently demanded by locals who rebelled when an attempt was made to change up the style, it was with greetings from John as well as friendly servers that our group of five was seated in a large round booth in back, more stories of Italy and Metro's New York roots helping to pass time before the start of a true feast; the well-seasoned fries a bit less crisp that would have been ideal, or perhaps simply just less memorable than a quintet of delicious meatballs atop soft garlic knots and the restaurant's complimentary housemade bread.Ordering a stuffed pizza but told that the customized calzones would indeed arrive first, it was admittedly a bit shocking when three of the folded-pies landed at the center of our table, each large enough to feed two-to-three adults all on its lonesome with a crunchy shell giving way to a molten cheese center, the flavor of ricotta particularly prominent even when dunked in a sidecar of meat sauce with each bite far lighter than one ever would have guessed.Requesting one of the trio be packed to go, a reheated calzone reportedly proving more than palatable per a reliable friend, it was next to The Cicero that eyes were turned and as much as a pasta-filled iteration was a fun bit of novelty just a few weeks prior the meatball and ricotta-stuffed double-crust was even more decadent, the execution impressing not just those of us calling Las Vegas and Ohio home but also those visiting  from the Windy City land of Giordano's.Missing out on Metro's desserts during the seminar on Sky Pointe, and almost too full under these circumstances to indulge once again, it was at John's insistence that a platter of pastry arrived last, the crisp cannoli rivaling some of Sin City's best while both the chocolate and carrot cake were as elegant as those served full-fledged bakeries, the cheesecake simply too at this point to be enjoyed past more than a bite.A bit dated on first glimpse, the explanation from John helping to explain décor that dates to my childhood, Metro on Decatur may not be as 'fancy' as the one up North, but with food just as good it seems John's formula remains in skilled hands even outside the Flagship, future visits to other locations soon to come.Previous visits I had sliders and salads, but lately I've been eating from the pizza portion of the menu exclusively. The rumors and ratings are right: this place has fantastic pizza. Multiple crusts to choose from, several specialty options, but almost everything I've tried has been great.The Modesto is my favorite: roasted mushrooms, garlic, and roma tomatoes, with fresh basil. And you can add sausage for FREE. Who has ever heard of that?! So props for having legit vegetarian options, and for kicking them up another level with the carnivore customization option. The small is perfect for two, add on some wings or a salad and you won't do too much damage to your diet.The stuffed pizzas are also a hit- I'm not a fan of carbs on carbs on carbs, but BF would consider selling one of his kidneys for a large Loop (sausage, pepperoni, roasted mushrooms). The marinara dipping sauce is robust and comforting, but the crust is a bit too thick for my personal liking. I will say that the large, 8 slices for $30, is a great deal if you have a large group: similar, smaller, thinner slices in town go for $5/each elsewhere, and this averages out to under $4/slice with much better quality and a larger portion.And service. It's always great. Phoning in my order is easy, it's always ready on time at pickup, and staff are friendly when I pop in. Bonus points for having the two takeout-pickup spaces in the parking lot!2 for 1 Whole Pizzas on Sundays and 2 for 1 Slices or Whole Pizzas on Thursdays. This location only. No player card needed. Open everyday from 11 am to 12 midnight!Located inside the Ellis Island Casino off of Flamingo and Paradise, this find of a gem is a must especially on those days! For those that are not familiar with Metro Pizza, these guys are consistently in the top 5 of the Best of Las Vegas. For you first timers I suggest the Gotham, which has a little bit of everything. If not that, then the Honululu, which has ham, pineapple, green onions, and bacon bits!They not only have pizza, but their Garlic Romano Fries will definitely keep the vampires away from you! Or that one obnoxious person you don't wanna talk to! They have other locations as well but why would you not go here on those two days listed? You not only save money, but you get 2 awesome pizzas guaranteed!The only downfall I think is that on those particular days, they are very busy. They do have booths with tables but they are usually taken. My suggestion would be to call for pick up. When you get there, if there are tables available, by all means, grab them! If not, then you can always go somewhere else to eat.Lastly, don't forget to get an Ellis Island player's card because you just might score a free slice!
Oregano's Pizza Bistro=Don't tell anyone back East that I had a Chicago-style pizza last night!  I'll lose a pinky or end up buried in the Meadowlands.What I like about Oregano's is the freshness.  We ordered the deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza and they warned us that it would take 45 minutes.  Hey, fine with me.  So, to bide the time, we got cheesy bread.  This thing was about 2 feet long!  It came out in a bread basket, but was hanging over the ends.  That's how long it was.  Hey, I'm single.  I pay attention to length.There are a million different ingredients you can put on your pizza.  We had mushrooms (you can choose regular or portabella), onions (white, carmelized or red), green peppers and jalapenos.  It came out loaded with cheese and topped with sauce.  I like that.  It made the veggies and cheese all melted together and then topped with sauce.  I could only have one piece.  I didn't stay for the pazookie.  One of these days, I will.  The service was excellent.  We had a table outside (it had stopped raining) near the heaters.  The manager even gave me a blankie to put on my lap.There is a great amount of effort that goes into eating at this particular Oregano's. First of all, arriving between the times of 430-6ish means you will be arriving near the time where there is limited parking space. I'm not sure how many people Oregano's seats, but it's 3x the amount of parking spots available. Secondly, the wait time can be killer. They do not accept reservations so you can easily wait up to 45 minutes during a non-weekend dinner rush. It's up to you to bring a powerbar or a TIME magazine, luckily I live 1 block away so I can come by, write my name down and go back home to watch LEBRON JAMES manhandle Paul Pierce. Or you can wait around and hope they bring you out pizza samples while you wait, which they commonly do.I did take my dad to this restaurant for his birthday. When we were all seated...my mom changed her mind and decided she did not like her seat...."uhhh, excuse me waitress, my mom really doesn't like this seat...can we please move?" Even though it was busy and crowded, no hesitancy, we got moved immediately. Definitely some solid service points with the staff. Despite the wait, the customer service here is impeccable, makes the wait time extremely tolerable.So we built our own Stuffed Crust 12 inch pizza with mushrooms, chicken and jalapenos....which takes 45 minutes to make. 45 MINUTES! So, yeah that sounds like a long time and it is. But good food is not fast food, do not forget this. While we waited we ordered the large Big Beefstroni Salad, which came anchored down with a mix of shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, white cheese, tomatoes, spinach, Romaine lettuce and crispy sauteed sweet onions on top. And it comes with some bomb dressing (not ranch). Definitely enough to feed 3-4 people. Once we finished that up, our pizza was knocking down our stomachs. This was a massively deep pizza with cheese and sauce and toppings for days. The menus says that it's big enough to feed 4-6 people. Sometimes when I read that, I think to myself that's a lie. But not this time my hungry friends. 4-6 people actually means 4-6 people. Oregano's, you have great dinners but you make me feel like a wood-legged pirate running a marathon...it takes me so long to finish with you, but alas your food is good and the amount of homeless people surrounding your establishment is amazingly 0....which is difficult to accomplish when you are so near to Mill Ave. So for this I thank you.I do wish parking was better, I do wish that there was more variety on your menu and I do wish that your seating was more comfortable. I'm 6 ft 3 and when I sit in one of your booths, the table is nearly on level with my head. I feel like a child who needs a booster seat.If I were ever to be grossly obese and it were due to the fact that I stuffed myself with Oregano's on a daily basis, I think I'd be willing to set my vanity aside and be quite content with that fact. Needless to say, this is not a place to go while you are on a diet. This is the place to go when you want a good ol' fashioned carb overload Italian style. I consume more carbs in one meal here than I do in a month of eating at home. And I love every gluten filled bite of it. Notable items: Cheesy bread - two foot long loaf of soft wonderful white bread slathered in garlic butter with oodles of melty cheddar cheese blend. GAWD. This is my favorite thing on the menu. I don't even try to pretend I'm not a gluttonous pig when it comes to this stuff and I always help myself to the last piece. Wings- BIG FAT drumsticks. All of them. Honey hot is delish along with the buffalo. Caesar salad - holy crap their salads are huge. They have three sizes. The full (or whatever they call it) is big enough for four or five people to eat from if it isn't the main dish. Bollo Pasta - with meatballs - Angel hair pasta and marinara with two huge meatballs, oh and the pasta is never ending. I have yet to see anyone get more than halfway through the first round though. *note angel hair being so thin sometimes the pasta has come out mushy(overcooked), all I've had to do was mention it and the problem was remedied in a very timely manner usually followed up by a manager visit, they don't mess around with customer service. Pizookie - Obvi. No, it isn't the best Italian I've EVER had but it is solid and consistent and really hits the spot when you want your fix. And the pricing is awesome. Lisa E, Nydia A and I binged at the one on Shea a couple of months ago, had the cheesy bread, wings and pizookie and our bill was $20. We sat there staring at the bill and each other dumbfounded for a couple of minutes. If you don't like this place, all I have to say is "Wanna PIZZA me?!" ;)
Cowboy Ciao=One senses a unique bend of lighthearted swank and artsy irreverence when entering Cowboy Ciao. The mixture of these two elements is a dicey proposition that's fraught with peril, but management has successfully done it...and  created an ambiance that mixes soft and hip music, subdued and sultry lighting, and break-the-rules decor while still coming off as elegant funk rather than young punk angst.Myself and my sidekick got here during prime time on a Friday night when the estimated table-wait was hovering right around the 40 minute mark.  Rather than hole-up for a table, we opted for zero-wait seating at the bar.  The waiters were great....both informative and talkative folks that made you feel comfortable with a genuinely friendly air about them that eschewed excessive fawning in favor of a down-home demeanor laced with neighborly charm.Grub-wise, everything we had was fantastic.  We started out with a Ciabatta appetizer served with both green and kalamata olive puree.  Next up, the famous "Chopped Stetson Salad", an indescribably unique and wonderful taste that's often known to upstage the main course.  They bring it to you with six different ingredients set in rows and explain what each ingredient is. Next, their server mixes it up in front of you with a special dressing.  It's savory taste and simple recipe has presented experienced cooks with something of an inexplicable magic trick.  From what I gather, many have tried to duplicate the taste, texture, and nuances of this deceptively simple dish, and lack of success has created vexing puzzle that's become the local culinary equivalent of Fermat's Enigma or the Four Color Problem. My date opted for Pistachio-crusted salmon.  I went light and ordered the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Both dishes were fantastic.  Icing on the cake came in the form of my favorite beer on the planet....Anchor Steam on tap.  My only gripe?  My dish should have come with bread to soak up the excess Mushroom sauce.  We asked if we could get some, and the only option provided was to order another ciabatta appetizer.  C'mon people...bread is cheap!  My date and her raging sweet tooth opted for desert....I had another beer.  She satiated her sugary cravings with something called a "zinger" that looked like raspberry infused cheesecake, and sang it's praises while relishing every morsel of it.Welcoming ambiance and staff.  Great menu and fantastic, creative dishes.  There's no TV visible anywhere, but the staff will update you on the D-backs or Suns games if you ask. Downtown Scottsdale is chock-full of incredible shops, and the surrounding area makes for a nice post-meal stroll. All in all, it's a truly unique dining experience that's taken the artistic ethos of it's surrounding area and successfully applied it to Southwestern Cuisine.  If you're in the area and looking to chow down in a manner that'll give you something to tell the folks back home about,  then by all means stop by, sit down, and check it out.By the time I ate here, I was totally cynical of all Scottsdale restaurants and was really thinking about having my lunch at In-N-Out.  I got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!So, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  Anyway, this place has "Republic of Tea" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!Next comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.Anyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.One of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!This is a tough review to write.  The location was great and I'm sure the dinner would've been good too based on the other reviews.Unfortunately, my team didn't like anything on the pre-set menu and the restaurant didn't want to work with them on finding alternates.  I was a restaurant manager, so yeah, I get it - the food has already been purchased and prepped, etc.  But there were only 8 of us; how hard is it to be flexible?  How hard is it to say, "Yes of course, but we will have to charge you separately"?  When a group that is spending a couple thousand dollars on dinner tells you they're going to leave before you even bring the appetizers out, doesn't that concern you?  Wouldn't you send a manager over?If you're Cowboy Ciao, the answer to all of these is no.  What a bummer.I enjoyed a meal here this past Saturday with two girl friends and I have to tell you: THE best barbecue sauce I have had in my life! I am talking about the cherry barbecue sauce that comes on the side with the short ribs (which were pretty dry on their own). I am somewhat embarrassed to share that I was plucking the cherries from the sauce and eating them straight! The short rib was served on cheesy grits and while usually the texture of grits doesn't work for me, these were pretty good. I credit the abundance of cheese with altering the texture. Dessert was also delicious: the cuppa red hot chocolate is a mug filled with two layers of dense chocolate mousse at least one of which is laced with chile that inspires a cinnamon red hot-like burn in the very back of your palette on the finish. Definitely a desert to be shared. We also split the peanut butter mousse dessert which was in a chocolate cookie shell and was much less dense - in fact, it was runny and spilled out of the sides when the shell broke but the peanut butter flavor was perfect and it was accompanied by 3 chocolate covered peanut butter cookie dough balls. One for each of us -- we didn't even have to fight over them! Other great things warranting these stars? We were able to walk in on Saturday night and get a table; the wine list is extensive and includes very accessible options; the portions are huge and the price is moderate - more than a fair deal for the quality of food.It's no secret that I love cowboys. I love anything that has to do with cowboys. One day, I will make a cowboy mine...*ok calming down now* So the decision to dine at Cowboy Ciao was a no brainer! Next, I need to scold myself: WHY haven't I been to Cowboy Ciao for a meal before??? BAD Dottsy! BAD! Moving on... I visited CB's with two friends and didn't know I was going to be hit upside the head with some REALLY. GOOD. FOOD. We were greeted and seated immediately, which was quite a surprise for a Friday night, but there was a table just about to leave so we lucked out. I decided on having the special of the evening which was the Harris Ranch Rib-eye with creamy spaghetti squash. My dear Yelpers, I dream about the dish to this day! I had it perfectly rare which made me a very happy Diva! The spaghetti squash was perfectly cooked and perfectly creamy. It was amazing! I am batting my eyelashes blissfully as I type these words. We also split a dessert that was equally delicious, but I don't remember exactly what it was. I do remember a chocolate cup filled with a peanut butter mousse. Fab! Oh wait! How could I forget the cup of chocolate with chili mixed in? Again, another GREAT dessert...So why not 5 stars? I have yet to return to CB and you all know I don't give it all away on a first date! I excitedly await my next visit to Cowboy Ciao. The food was masterfully prepared and I enjoyed my entire visit!Went for half-priced brunch this weekend and it was awesome! Totally plan to return and pay full price - they're already beyond reasonable! And, there's a delicious assortment of interesting and delicious breakfast cocktails - what more could a brunch-goer want!?!The food is decent, nothing to really go crazy about and not really worth the price. but it's decent and close to work so that makes it easy.the biggest issue i have is with the service. after multiple visits i have come to the conclusion that the servers and employees are friendly but it takes 1.5 hrs to have lunch. and that wouldn't be a problem if i thought the food was spectacular enough to wait that long. and our drinks are almost always empty and the servers are hard to find. i'll most likely continue eating here every now and then bc it's convenient and it's easy to please everyone... but i wouldn't really go out of my way to go here.The word "perfect" can been defined as, "having all the required or desirable elements, qualities, or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be."Based on that definition, the Stetson Chopped Salad at Cowboy Ciao is "perfect"!  If I was a salmon, then ending up in this salad would be the perfect ending to my life.  Ok, that sounds a little weirder to read that it did when it was in my head... but the point is that this salad is absolutely "to die for."  For salmon, that is. The Berkshire Pork Belly comes crispy confit style with roasted Brussels sprouts, shallots, toasted almonds, cheese, and a Oaxacan chile honey drizzle.  I don't have to tell you how good that sounds, just go back and read those ingredients again.  Seriously, I'll wait... go read them again.  Pork Belly makes me smile...Needless to say, the Pork Belly also came close to being perfect!  But... even if the Pork Belly was not perfect, the excellent friendly, timely, and attentive service made this entire experience truly perfect. Way to go, Cowboy Ciao!  In the words of the Governator, I'll be back!So this has been one of the best meals I've ever had, yet I have some constructive criticism. PROS:1. The food is to DIE FOR. The Stenson salad is delicious and the perfect appetizer to split. The truffle mac and cheese is so gooey, i wish there was more of it to share. I had the special, which was a 20 oz. ribeye steak. IT WAS HUGE. Also came with asparagus and this great mashed potatoes. It was seasoned perfectly, it wasnt till halfway through they give you some delicious sauce to pour all on it. Yet, you really dont need it! 2. The servers are very friendly and well seasoned employees, they DEFINITELY know what youre talking about. 3. They do wine flights? Need I say more? Plus, they have one of the most eccentric wine lists, it would take you at least an hour just to read each one. Some offered only by the bottle. 4. They gave me a free shot for my birthday, delicious. ------------------------CONS: 1. The layout of the place, its kind of cramped, especially when you are trying to maneuver around people trying to get to the bathroom.2. The food service, while amazing, was slow. For 2 appetizers and 3 entrees being ordered at the same time, the entire service took 3 hours. It was fine for our party, but not suggested if you are in a rush. 3. A litttttle on the pricey side, while the food was amazing, you cant get an entree and an appetizer for under 50 dollars per person here. Just to warn you, then again, it IS scottsdale. TIP:Make a reservation. On a tuesday night, there wasnt one empty table in sight. people were sitting at the bar just to get some time of meal service. One of my new favorite american places!We were excited to visit Cowboy Ciao last Friday night for a business function which turned into the worst experience of our lives in a restaurant.  I can get over the fact that our entrees took well over an hour to arrive and one of them had a long, blonde hair on the plate to boot.  What I will never get over is how I was treated by the manager after choking on the short ribs at the table - one of the most terrifying experiences of my life.  I'm not sure exactly why this happened; perhaps, because my entree was cooked on the same grill as shellfish, which I'm allergic to.  I started choking and literally threw up at the table in front of my friends and clients and nobody came to help; offer a napkin, glass of water, anything!  (However, I will give the waiter credit for bringing me a mint 15 minutes later.  Lost points though for adding in an auto gratuity for subpar service).  The only time the manager stepped up was 10 minutes later by yelling at our wives for being in the men's room stall with me because I was having a hard time breathing.  And then he had the gall to insinuate that I was drunk.I spend about $40k/year entertaining clients in restaurants and our tab this night was $700 (which I was picking up).  You can bet your ass that I will never set foot in this place again and I will be sure all my business contacts do the same.  The manager should be fired because for being a total disgrace and sorry excuse for a human being.
Z Tejas Grill=Yes, it's a chain. But it's a Texas chain that opened it's first restaurant on 6th Street in Austin. That's street cred in my book. I've been to all their Austin locations, but now frequent the one off Mill Avenue in Tempe. Went for lunch just this afternoon as a matter of fact, and it always amazes me how I forget how good the food is between visits, even the complimentary corn bread. Today I ordered the Blackened Catfish Tacos with black beans and rice. Yum. I also recommend the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas and Baked Seafood Enchiladas.I paid my first visit to Z-Tejas during a nice bike ride in Tempe because a co-worker of mine claimed they had a great happy hour. I have passed by this restaurant numerous times and didn't think anything special would come from a visit. I had the notion that this was another typical Mexican chain that was most likely overpriced and overrated. I can only speak for their happy hour, but it was probably one of the best happy hours around town! Everything was so cheap and great quality! I swear by their Chambord Margaritas...They are only $5 and although they seem smaller than expected, they pack a killer punch and tastes great! I was not expecting to feel that kind of buzz from one margarita! They definitely pour heavy with the alcohol!! We were planning on hitting the Chuck box for dinner afterwards so we decided to try an appetizer off of the happy hour menu just to give it a try and munch on a snack until we finished our drinks. That did not happen. We were sooooo full from the pork nachos appetizer that we could not even think about eating anything else. When the waitress brought them out, we were in shock and I guess it happens all the time because she immediately said, " I know, they're huge and the biggest thing you can get for $5 anywhere." (LOOK AT MY PICTURE OF IT) Not only was it humongous, it was incredibly delicious!!! They are extremely generous with all of the toppings (and boy, do they have a lot of toppings). We asked for hot sauce and she brought out sriracha. At first we were like, sriracha? That weird, but she walked away and I love sriracha so I was like I'll give it a try, why not? WOW it surprisingly went perfect with the pork and cheese etc. I can't wait to come back for happy hour again because everything on the menu looked amazing!! Our server was so kind and funny. She was very helpful and helped us choose the perfect meal for the day! I think her name was Christina. I definitely recommend trying their happy hour!! I posted a picture of the HH menu and their hours are in there on the side. Happy Hour is 3-7 Mon-Fri and 2-6 on weekends. Do ITTTTTT!
Kimberly Ann's Tea Room & Cafe=A tea shoppe serving tea in bags...that can be bought at the local grocery store...tsk, tsk.Some of the food was from Costco (confirmed by our waitress).  My sister and daughter thought the chicken salad made them a little sick.While strolling around Downtown Glendale, the girls and I decided we were hungry.  Upon walking around the many cafe/restaurants, we decided to give Kimberly Ann's a try.When entering, we were overwhelmed by the theme of this cozy little place.  It was pretty cute --- not TOO overkill-y.  There was tons of stuff to look at.  You can say this place borderlines cluttered.  I felt like I was on that TLC show, "Hoarders: Buried Alive!"So anyways, two of the ladies got the quiche with chicken gumbo soup, I had the BLT, and we had some scones afterward.  The quiche just melts in your mouth, the BLT was cooked to perfection, and the Mae's scones were truly the best.  We shared a strawberry scone, a blueberry scone, and a cranberry scone with devonshire cream and lemon curd.  Yummy!Although the chips were a weird non-Victorian touch, I think this place is okay.I wish I could review this place, but after walking past we found it closed...on a Saturday...despite it being 10:30 and the posted business hours said 10-4...I am in favor of helping local business and I enjoy spending money at mom and pop's rather than chains, but it is hard to do when a business doesn't even adhere to their posted hours.I had the misfortune of holding a group function there today.  I had been in touch with the owner for two days before the event to give her the numbers, which ended up bring 16.  I walked in an hour early to set up.  The set up wasn't quite what I asked for so I asked her to adjust it (take three off of one table and put that at an empty four top.   She seemed very put out but did it.  Her two young granddaughters were the only staff there and the place was empty when I arrived.  My function was called for 1:00 but several guests arrive late and 3 did not show up.  Still we had 13 for lunch.  I saw that there were two other rooms in the back, each having 4 tables of 4.  When I arrived she told me we had to leave by 3:00 (those were her exact words)!  That was never mentioned before.  At about 2:00 another party of 4 arrived and were seated in the back room.  I figured since there were coming in so late they couldn't possibly be closing by 3.  Everything was fine, except for the unbelievably slow service.  At the end, everyone paid their bill and left, except for 2 that stayed behind to talk.  I kept asking for my bill and finally got it - The item I ordered was $8.95.  There was also a $50 charge for room rental.  I told the owner that there was never mention of a room charge and had I known there was, I wouldn't have booked my event there.  She said that since she had to hold a whole room for me and was limited to the reservations she could take, I was being charge.  She began to argue with me and I finally stopped and said - "so you don't mind losing the business of 14 new customers?"  And she replied "No, I don't!".  I tried to reason with her but she kept arguing and was very nasty.  She even insulted my two remaining guests by telling them how messy they were.  I was going to charge the amount and then dispute it with my credit card but I was afraid to give her my credit card.  I ended up leaving $20 on the table and left ($10 more than I owed).  A few minutes later she had left a message on my voice mail telling me I could either come back and pay her or she was going to call the police.  I have never encountered such a nasty women in my life.  I'm glad she feels she doesn't need the business because it looks like she's not getting it anyway.  I had 3 less people than I told her, but she had 7 empty tables in the back so I guess she was trying to make up for her own lost income since no one made reservations.The food was good, however, the service was definitely lacking and the decor a bit lacking and tacky.I felt that the food was not worth the cost.  Also, was not happy with the requirement to pay in cash since we used a Groupon. Jane LI used a Living Social coupon for 2 people for high tea at Kimberly Ann's. Sounds like it should be a fun and enjoyable experience, right? Well, it turned out to be a lot of "work". We wanted to go to high tea in December, but they were completely booked. Ok - we were disappointed but we scheduled it for early January. Well, a week or so before the date we were to have high tea, they called and said they would be closed due to plumbing problems. Another disappointment but we rescheduled for later in the month. What made this difficult were all the "rules":1. You need to call at least 24 hours in advance to make the reservation.2. They require a Visa or Mastercard number to hold the reservation. No-show's who do not give 24 hours notice will be charged $25.00 plus tax. (Is this a doctor's office???)3. You must mention any coupon over the phone or you will be charged the full price on the day of your reservation.4. The coupon price does not include tax and gratuity. They suggest a gratuity of 18% - 25% of the original price of $25.00 per person.5. CASH ONLY for the $10.00 "required" gratuity for the coupon plus tax of $2.63 per 2 people. If you do not bring cash, you will both be charged the full price of the high teas.WOW! That's all I can say. While the food was terrific and the service was good, they also had an additional "rule" stating only one type of tea per table. What if one person wants decaf and the other wants caffeinated tea? Too bad! As previously mentioned, there is a "funny" sign on one of the bathroom doors saying: "If you have to go #2, please do not use this restroom." They then direct you to another restroom away from diners. Weird but true! I wish I had taken a picture of the sign.I'm a huge fan of high tea, but I won't go back to Kimberly Ann's. I would recommend the English Rose Tea Room in Carefree for an exceptional high tea experience. Check out their website: www.carefreetea.comAlso, the Biltmore and the Phoenician Resorts have fantastic high tea as well, for a higher price than the English Rose.I was SO excited to go here... One of my clients wanted to thank me for the work we accomplished together and so she treated me to High Tea. I dressed up for the occasion and when we walked up I noticed the sign next to the door announcing the soup and scone and salad (I think?) of the day. It was listed as a walnut scone and since I am HIGHLY allergic I told our server as soon as we were seated that I would need whatever the alternative was due to my allergy. There was no nut free alternative. And on top of that she scolded me like a child for not saying something at the time of the reservation. My client had no clue of my allergy and could not have known. THEN our tray of goodies were brought out and she pointed out everything on the trays that had nuts in it. (Probably close to 75% of the tray was nutty). She half heartedly apologized that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to pick around my allergens.In today's day I am stunned that they are so callous towards such a common issue, and that they couldn't have been bothered to even make me some sandwiches on a different bread so I could enjoy a little more than half a sandwich and some fruit. The tea wad lovely, and the decor was perfect for a tea house, but their total lack of regard was awful. If I had gone on my own I would have demanded a refund and made a but of a scene. As it stands I think I'm going to be letting the health department know about this place....I have very mixed feelings about this place.  I very much enjoyed my tea time with my grandmother.  She enjoyed it immensely.  It was pretty, quiet, and our server (a guy who I thought was the handyman or something) was super nice.  The food was good, the tea was delicious.  As a livingsocial deal, it is ROTTEN.  Getting a reservation was impossible.  I was told I could only make one for Monday thru Friday at 11 or at 2.  And to include gratuity was offensive because on their menu gratuity and tax are included in the $25 per person cost of tea.  And now I gave my extra voucher to a friend to use, because my original reservation in December got canceled due to a flood in their kitchen and I didn't have time to use two vouchers.  My friend was told that the voucher had already been redeemed, which was impossible (the voucher I used didn't even use the name on her voucher).  I don't really understand how this happened.  Or why it wouldn't have been brought to her attention when she made the reservation.  Then, my friend decided to just order off the menu and still hadn't been served after 40 minutes of waiting with her 3 year old daughter.  Overall I wish that they would just stop running the livingsocial deal because it seems like it is only making people mad.  Its a cute place and was a good time but not worth the headache.  I also don't think that it would be worth it at full price.Took my Mother to High Tea today thankfully the owner extended my Living social voucher for one more day.  Boy what a mistake it was buying this deal!! I bought two vouchers but was told I could only use one even if we say at separate tables. Ok so I should read the fine print better.  Our waiter was the only one working today bad sign, we saw him a total of 4 times , had to go find someone for a box and then we were leaving out the back since my mom is disabled . Waiter comes out joking I thought that we were dining and ditching!!! I told him tip is on the table he said it wasn't correct!! Well I am not leaving 12.50$ for his tip !! Talked to the owner who called me cheap and said everyone else left that much ! Not me!! As I was leaving heard waiter say " yah and they tried to leave without paying!! Oh ya me and my disabled mom making a run for it!! Ha ha would not recommend this place to anyone!!!I was so excited to take my mom here for her birthday last year. I bought a groupon months in advance. Problems first started when I tried to make a reservation. The lady did not seem to know exactly what a good time to come and was not very professional. We finally found a time in the early afternoon. When I got there it was very busy and it took a while to get acknowledged. There were a few open tables that still had food sitting on them. We were told to wait outside and someone would show us to our table. We waited and waited outside. I was pregnant at the time and started to feel sick from being hungry and waiting outside. I went in to check. I had to wait about 5 minutes before anyone even came by. The tables were still dirty and the same people were waiting for food. We were told to wait outside some more. We waited for about 50 mins past our reservation before we were even seated. Then we continued to wait some more. By this time I was feeling really sick and needed something in my stomach. Our waitress finally came. She was a young girl and it was her second day. She told us how 3 waitresses did not come but the owner kept sitting walkins so that is why we waited so long. She took our order for tea and what menu we were getting. We sat for another 30 mins without any service, not even tea. Our groupon came with soup so I flagged the waitress asking for our soup while we were waiting for our sandwiches and tea so I wouldn't throw up. She said she would get it right away. It never came. Finally the sandwiches and tea arrived and I didn't throw up, so it was a miracle. This place would have gotten 1 star but the sandwiches and food was really good. The service and management is just terrible. The owner has no business sense  You would be better off to go to your niece or daughters tea room and have a pretend tea than go here.This place is a disaster as a tea house.  Don't go here.We had to wait to be seated, even thought we had a reservation.  The owner and waitstaff were extremely rude and put out to seat us and take our order, even though the place was almost empty.I love tea, and have frequented may tea houses before.  I made a reservation to have tea here,  Apparently, I did not specify that I would want tea and tea sandwiches  when I made the reservation, so we could not have high tea or any type of tea that you would normally get in a tea house.   We had to order off a bistro menu and I had a salad and my friend had a sandwich.  We thought it was a fluke and came back a second time making sure to emphasize we wanted to have tea at the tea house when we made our reservation.  We got there.  More rudeness, more waiting, mediocre food.Skip this place.Called to inquire about High Tea service as a gift for my wife and her sister as sort of a Sister's Date since she was coming from overseas. The people on the phone were so RUDE that I know now why they have such a poor rating. If you don't like customers and they are such a bother to you, why are you in business?The service was excellent from the young man who brought our tea, salads, and lunch items.  No complaints there.The tea was great, the salads, too.  However, the cucumber sandwiches were bitter, and so was the tunafish.  When we told the woman server of this, we were told "Well, sometimes you get a bitter cucumber."  When we asked her to substitute those with the ones we DID like (cranberry chicken salad or egg salad) we were told, "No, the chef already made all she's going to make for the day, and we won't make you more."I about fell off my chair, so did my mom. For a 70th birthday present, I couldn't believe we had to endure 'no substitutions' for SOUR food.! What a joke. We will NOT be returning, and will take our business to better establishments for high tea, like the Ritz.We also did not care for the fact that gratuity and tax were automatically added and would NOT have tipped that much on a $70 bill for such POOR customer service. I'm surprised this place still sticks around, what a disgrace.I attempted to use my living social voucher this afternoon at Kimberly Ann's Tea Room. Had the pleasure of dealing directly with the manager/owner, Kimberly. Unfortunately, she would not honor my voucher stating that it required 24 hour advance reservation. I asked her to show me where in the fine print this stipulation was listed and when she was unable to find it she stated that it was Living Social's fault for not including it. Really? Aren't you in charge of final ad copy as the merchant?? I requested that she apply my voucher to purchase price of anything else on the menu and she refused. I didn't think that was too much to ask. Now she will have to deal with the negative feedback about her establishment/management practices on the internet. Definitely NOT a smart management decision on her part. Below is an exact copy of fine print on my voucher:the fine printLimit 2 per customer, 2 additional as giftsLimit 1 per table per visitValid Monday through ThursdayExcludes holidays including Valentine's Day, Easter, and Mothers Day weekendEntire value must be used in a single visit
Cocomo Joe's=OPH how can I 'splain it? Someone called this OPH which stands for "Old People Hangout." Oh contraire mon fraire. There were a hand full of people in their late 20's. Ok...pretty much everyone here was in their 40's or 50's. Lots of divorcees here. So if you're a young single stud...cougar season is year round. This bar provided my first glimpse at a couple getting freaky to a U2 song. Where the Streets have no name will never be the same. Tip the bathroom attendant. I did..after I grabbed my 3rd lollipop. The cover band performing was in their 6th year in Cave Creek? Might be time to get out guys. You blew my mind when you dropped the parents just don't understand line. Wow. 32 ounce beers are dope. Oh and some dude tried to pull my brother-in-law's sweater strings. So my brother-in-law gave him a titty twister. I watched this in a drunken stupor. Don't worry I was gonna step in when they started tickling each other and thumb wrestling.Next time I want to party with my mom this is where I will go, because every single person in there aside from the people at my table were old enough to be my parents. And most of them were apparently swingers.. Lovely. 50+ year old husband/wife swappers looking to score.. The mental pictures are scarring my mind. Excuse me while I barf.Anyway a few friends met up here to watch some football and drink some cheap beer. Who knew it would turn into Beerfestival 2009 accompanied by way too many shots of Jameson. I think this is the only way we all could stand the atmosphere. To top it off the food was not good at all, my Chicken Chimi tasted a little bit like vomit and the sampler was pretty much a roasted pineapple slice with a mound of hard potato strings and 3 overcooked shrimp on skewers growing out of it. To top it off, I was in the ladies room with 25 cougars and a mouse ran across the floor.. imagine 25 half naked 50 year old women bouncing up and down, arms flailing and screaming at the top of their lungs.. because that is what was going on. Ridiculous. I will only go back here if Georgie S. drags me here again for drunken football debauchery.. otherwise, count me out.Cooooouuuuggggaaaarrssss..... here cougar, cougar.....Botox: CheckFakies: Check (including my own)Vaginal Rejuvenation: CheckIt gets worse... yes, can you imagine???Affliction: CheckFaux-Hawks: CheckOverbearing Cologne: CheckNow that I think of it, this is probably a perfect match: Women significantly past their prime and the douchebags of society waiting to pray off of them...I shouldn't judge; I really shouldn't... I may end up here in 26 years when I am at the equivalent age of the majority demographic. In fact, thank god this place exists otherwise we may have to worry about the douchebags and douchebaguettes (credit, Dallas G.) infiltrating our beloved downtown favorites. 2 stars for the mojitos and wasabee dipping sauce.MeeeeoooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwI give up.A friend suggested meeting here for lunch this week. I reluctantly said yes. We were the first ones in. We went to the right and up the few steps to find a table. EVERYONE had dirty chairs and tables with crumbs, obviously from the night before. If i was desperate, there might have been enough food around to make a meal.After looking at each other we decided to try one of the high tops down in the bar area. OK, the chairs were clean and the table top looked clean so we sat. Since there were two of us at a four place, i went to move the salt and pepper out of the way. Not an easy chore since the salt was stuck to the table. Breaking it loose and moving on to move the small appetizer plates, they were stacked for four.The top three slide off, the bottom one stuck to the table. The table had that sticky "someone almost tried to clean it off" feeling to it.To the waitress' credit, after mentioning the upper chairs and tables she got a towel and went to clean them off after telling us it must have been the night crew's mistake - WELL DUH!Again, there's no management at this place. If they would clean up, improve the inconsistent food and get it together, they might do more biz. Maybe they need to call in Restaurant Impossible, OR... just ask their customers. We could all tell them a few things... those of us that care.As a note, it was my friend's first time there wanting to try it. She said she'd never be back. . Maybe my standards for cleanliness and good food are higher than some others but... I always tell it like i see it. ...I give up, I'm done with this hole
Casey Moore's Oyster House=How can you go wrong with Casey Moore's,This chill location is like no other, located in the middle of a residential district Caseys offers a chill location compared to the busy Mill Ave.  The wait staff and patrons are great peoples that come to enjoy a good beer and their friends.  Be ready to enjoy a very diverse crowed of people here.  The food,Ok well the food is above average here, personally I like the fries and the sandwich, I won't boast about every item on the menu. Look for the lights on the tree when you driving down Ash.So Casey's has been reviewed up and down on Yelp. I hope to provide some detailed information to help you get the best experience you can when coming to this neighborhood bar.First off, there are beer specials every day. If a review states that the beer was $3.50 it was either on happy hour or was the beer of the day. Most of the beers on draft are regularly $4-$4.50. They also have a decent selection of bottled beers (and Boddington's in the can).They have a board inside at the end of the main bar that has daily specials, this will usually consist of a higher dollar specialty item and desert along with a lower cost lunch type item. Just ask your server and they will give you the run down.If you are in the mood for a very fast appetizer, the clams or shrimp will arrive in usually less than 5 minutes. Other apps come out as usual 10-15 minutes. Sandwiches and salads run about the same time depending on what needs to be cooked. I personally recommend the Hippy Sandwich with Blackened Chicken.If you are looking for less of a crowd avoid Thursday-Saturday, as said before the bar is very popular and the weekend warriors come out in packs. Tuesday is a great day to come out, the special is Black and Tans but you can get either Bass or Guinness for $3.50 all day/night. A good place to park is the alleyway behind Buffalo Exchange or the parking lot to the east of it. If it's a busy night don't even try to get in the main parking lot.Sunday's a bartender named Tyler works the outside bar and he makes a seriously spicy Bloody Mary. He also loves to high five, don't let him down.Hope this info helps you have a good time at this great neighborhood spot, see you at the bar.Quick attentive bartenders. NoConvenient parking. NoPatrons above the age of 24. NoHot waitresses. No.Slow Waitresses. Yes.Everlasting brodeo. Yes.Dirty Bathrooms. Yes.Douchebaggery all around. Yes.Unfresh oysters. Yes. $3 kiltlifter. Yes.Asshole cops that follow you home afterwards. Yes.I decided that I pretty much hate this place. Sorry, I just do.I almost died at Casey Moore's!  Okay, that might be a bit of an overstatement.  I'm sitting in a booth and enjoying my first visit to Casey's when a drunk guy decided to lean against one of those outdoor gas heaters and almost knocked it over on me.  I think I yelled "oh my God" in horror as it tipped over in my direction, but thankfully it was more like one of those Weebles preschool toys.  You know, Weebles wobble but they don't fall down.  Then he actually tried to lean against it again!  After a few awkward moments, he finally realized what a horrible idea that was and moved on.  It reminds me of the time I saw a waiter try to put some candles out at the end of the night.  He kept using his fingers to extinguish the flame and kept getting burned, over and over again until he realized that he could just blow it out.  Why are some people so stupid? I loved the idea of Casey's.  The patio is awesome.  The food is basic.  I ordered the seafood sandwich and the waitress said they used imitation crab meat.  Not a big deal for me but I know a lot of people hate it.  Something I didn't know is that the process of making imitation crab was developed in Japan over 800 years ago... or so I read.  What the hell, did I just make this review useful?! Anyway, great place to grab drinks.  Just avoid jerks who use gas heaters to steady themselves.I have enjoyed some tasty food here in the past, but I won't be stepping foot in here again.  One of their bouncers, who refers to himself as "G", decided that it would be completely acceptable to let some transphobic words escape his mouth.  Now, in no way am I a transgender individual, but I do have much respect for the trans community and I can't believe this place would keep this dude around.  So, my girlfriend had to use the restroom and there was a huge line, so she peeked around to see if there was the same traffic jam by the guys bathroom and this dude just comes at her all aggressive like telling her she needed to get away and all that...which she was quick to move and apologize.  But then she asked him, "What if I was a transgender person?" To which this guy replied "Well then you can get out."  Really dude?  So, she informs the manager of this and he was on her side for sure.  The bouncer then began harassing her again and was trying to kick her out of the bar (for what?! Right...he didn't say) and she called to the manager that he was still being aggressive with her.  The three of them went to have a talk and the bouncer was trying to say that she called him the "N" word...UM MY GIRLFRIEND IS BLACK TOO JACKASS!  She never uses that word and would NEVER call someone that because she actually is a respectable person and isn't ignorant.  Did the manager say anything to the bouncer about his transphobic comment??  Did he?! NO!! I later called to ask what the manager's name was, and found out that not only is Gavin a manager but he's also part owner...you've got to be kidding me.It's a real shame when you let your employee harass a guest who didn't do anything but try to go pee.  Yelp folk, whether you're gay, straight, bi, queer, trans, a straight ally or something of the like, I strongly urge you to steer clear of this establishment and spend your money where this kind of behavior is not tolerated.Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.Visit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.Visit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.Visit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?Visit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, "I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there." Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, "There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar..." "We don't." He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). "No, I told you we don't." Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.I mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way.For March's International Supper Club UYE, we went lookin for a lil luck of the Irish and headed on down to Casey's Moore's Oyster House. I liked the feel and the look of the place, very woody, felt like it could be a pub in Dublin.  We arrived around 6:30 and our server let us know it was Happy Hour till 7 and that all apps were  1/2 off, so after checking out the app menu I went with the potato skins. They were potato halves stuffed with green chilies topped with melted cheese, chives and bacon with a side of ranch. These were good tasting potato skins!After checking out the menu I went with Casey's homemade Crab Cakes, sometimes I crave crab cakes, it's crazy I know.  These crab cakes are handmade and severed with fried served with homemade chipotle remoulade. I wasn't that impressed with the crab cakes, to me they were over fried, and the chipotle remoulade just tasted greasy.  Maybe the kitchen was having a bad nice because some of the other dishes that came out where not that great either. Or maybe this is the place to hit for Happy Hour drinks & Apps?Our serve was great, even though it stated on the menu 1 check per table, he gave us all separate checks. I thought that was nice of him to do.
King Wah Express=I really had the most unusual second experience here. The waitress's remembered us and the Chef ran out to take our order. He said he wanted to make us a special meal for us and said I remembered you like spicy. I said I'd like something with fish and vegetables. The waitress translated what I said to him and he ran to the kitchen. Soon out comes these tasty silken tofu cubed bowls that were lightly battered holding these tiny shrimp with a tasty dipping sauce.Next comes out this big bowl of hot and sour soup. The soup had lots of tofu threw it, pork and shrimp. Also some fresh made fried noodles that were very crisp and made with fresh clean oil. The soup was well made.Then we get a big plate with Sea Bass and Bok Choy. The fish was very fresh tasting and moist. The bok Choy was crisp and tasty. The sauce was silky smooth made very carefully from stock with taste of garlic a spicy pepper and the perfect amount of salt.Our two drinks and all this food only cost $26.00 before tip.As I said in my previous review. If you aren't Asian they give you the Americanized Chinese Menu. I note they have a Hong Kong Menu and Many Menus written in Chinese all over the walls here that change Often. I also note this isn't a fancy place.I don't think you are going to find another place like this anywhere.Update 5-30-15 As of April-2015 This restaurant was sold to new owners
Zur Kate=We set out to find Bavarian Point restaurant and stumbled into Zur-Kate by accident.  They are next door to each other, although I had never heard of Zur-Kate before.  What a stroke of luck.The atmosphere was very cozy with lots of German flair.  The place was very crowded at 8pm, and everyone seemed to be having a very god time.  The first thing we noticed about the menu was the far lower prices than the ones on menus we had seen on line for other Valley German restaurants.  Many different kinds of wurst, schitzel and chops are available to choose from.  Each entree comes with a choice of German potato salad, spatzel, potato cake, home fries or french fries.  You also receive your choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage.  A salad bar is included, and basket of rye bread delivered to the table.  There is not an entree on the menu over $12, and you can add a wurst to any entree for $2.50.  Beers are in the $2-$4 range - where does that happen?  These prices are already amazing, but then you see the portion sizes.  The schnitzels are huge, and each comes with a generous portion of side.  I had the Rhein Schitzel - juicy pork, lightly breaded and fried until golden bown and crisp, topped with sauteed onions and a sour-cream based light gravy.  It was fantastic.  Very well seasoned, light, not greasy and absolutley huge.  Add in the red cabbage and spatezel and you have a formidable meal.  I added a knockwurst just to try it, and there was no way that I could finish my dinner.  Everyone at my table felt the same about their meals.  This place is a gem and should not be missed.  I really cannot imagine what more you could want out of a German restaurant, except maybe higher prices.  Im sure the other restaurants in town are also good, but we cant wait to go back to Zur Kate.Who even knew such a good, authentic place existed way out here in the East Valley.  The place has been around for like 20 years.  The decor inside makes you feel like you're in Germany.  The wait staff was very nice and I thought the food was VERY good.  I had the sausage loaf with gravy, cabbage and these unreal home fried potatoes fried with bacon, OMG.  So good.  My date had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and potatoes.  I thought the brats were excellent as well.They have a nice bar with a lot of German beers.  The price was not bad, 2 dinners, 1 beer was about $24.00.Also note, their gravy is gluten-free!  Whoot.
Pizzafarro's=I think this family made the very first pizza I ever tasted. That's the story I'm going to stick with anyway (it was probably Chucky Cheese in reality). I have been a rabid fan of the pizzas they make for over 25 years. I remember when they were on Camelback near 44th Street. As a kid, I remember being afraid to try it, but after some coaxing I became a huge fan. Then they moved to the Scottsdale and Shea location... I have most of my memories of it here. Their kids opened a spinoff location on Indian School and 46th, but that eventually closed - it was never quite the same (though it was similar). The Scottsdale and Shea location finally closed two years ago much to my dismay.I only recently discovered this location way the hell up north. I'm glad to see them still making pizza (yeah, it's the same people - I recognized the chef/owner), and I'm even more glad to find that it's just the same as I remember. The crust is simple, the sauce is mild but plentiful, the cheese is gooey and high quality, and the toppings are fresh and delicious. Everyone has their favorite pizza and this is mine. Nothing has changed about it in a quarter of a century. It's still awesome. I always get Sausage and Pepperoni in case you're wondering.Aside from the quality of the food (which is amazing), the staff is nice. The interior needs a little work (it's kinda ugly - they should at least go back to the checkerboard tablecloths). The place kinda stinks too for some reason. It's not the food though... I don't know what the deal was with that. As soon as our pizza came, the smell went. Maybe someone ordered a stinky sandwich? Or maybe someone's colostomy bag needed to be emptied... I mean, the customers were a little on the silverhair side today. I'm sure it varies a lot. I do love the food here - I wish they would move close to me.Oh, and as has always been the case, the prices are pretty reasonable. It was less than 20 bucks for the two of us. Go check it out - definitely worth the trip.Good but not great. Friendly. Empty.The above capture my experience at Pizzafarro's, an intended quick stop before catching a flight back to a strange and distant habitat where 95 is considered hot. Arriving shortly after 5 on a Tuesday, we were the only dine-in patrons until right before we left when a lone diner arrived, signaling either a general or specific off-season.We settled on a loaf of garlic bread without melted cheese ($3.50) and a two-topping large 16' (~$23) with spinach and mushrooms. A brief aside - I come from the land of NY style pizza, and currently live in the land of not much resembling pizza. Under that lens, the garlic bread was a bit weak on the garlic and it was the best and will be the best pizza I've had in months with the right amount of oil and cheese, but the standard crust was a bit too hard and dry for me to appreciate it when compared to my memories of pizza in the NY area and the price seemed a bit high even for a boutique community. Pizzafarro's has mostly a monopoly on its market in its surrounding neighborhood and history to sustain it, since the commercial zones of Carefree (and Cave Creek) are practically non-existent. For a near the only game in town establishment, for convenience or in a hurry, one could do far worse, but there are better options (consider N.Y.P.D.) if one doesn't mind a short drive, already an Arizona residency requirement.
Karsen's Grill=If you can call a place that's been around for over 20 years a hidden gem, then I guess that's a good description of Karsen's. If I hadn't met dayside bartender Heidi at another location I would never have known of this place and I've probably walked by it numerous times in the past.Located on 1st Street in Old Town Scottsdale, Karsen's is a great place for comfort food like burgers, salads, soups, and patty melts. Karsen's also sports a full bar.In addition to the food, the other item that's clearly kept Karsen's going all these years is the atmosphere. The staff and the owners clearly know and value their regulars and you can tell that the regulars reciprocate. Even going in as a new customer I was made to feel very welcome and that's the type of service that builds loyalty.If you want a no-pressure, low key place to get food or drinks in Old Town Scottsdale, check out Karsen's Grill, you won't be disappointed.
Pedro's Mexican Restaurant=Stopped in for lunch just after 11 today.  The parking was already almost full even though there were plenty of empty tables inside.  The sign, that I didn't see for a couple of minutes, said to seat myself so I picked a table.  Just by myself I would have like a two top but all of the seating arrangements seemed to be 4-6.  The restaurant never filled up so I didn't feel bad for taking a space away.  I got a two item lunch special ($7.25) of a beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans (I could have had rice rather than beans).  I also got a root beer ($2.05).  Most of their drinks have an extra charge for refills but this was not a small glass and was plenty.  Right after I seated myself a bowl of warm chips, a small mixing bowl, a carafe of mild salsa and a bottle of hot sauce were on the table.  It was neat being able to adjust the heat of my salsa.  The shredded beef was very tasty and the shell was thin and crisp without being hard to bit through.  I would suggest eating the tacos quickly before the shell gets soggy. The enchilada and the beans were ok.  The sauce was a bit different than some other places.The service was quick and attentive.  You can tell they are used to getting the lunch crowd in and out in a reasonable amount of time.They have a couple of other weekday lunch specials as well as some smaller appetite options of  their regular menu items that can be ordered anytime.Whopping portions and exemplary service combine with excellent-tasting Mexican food to make Pedro's a Mexican restaurant worth your drive and money.Regular customers fill the seats which reflects the excellent service.  Chips and homemade salsa are delivered almost instantly after being seated, and the entrees are delivered quickly.  I had the 3 mini beef taco, tostada, and tacquito combo (picture is attached) and it was enormous and very tasty.  I was hungry and could only eat half, so it could definitely be enough for two people to split.Part of what brought me here was the buy-one, get-one coupon in the Entertainment Book.  So, even though my combo was normally $12, it averaged out to $6 after the coupon.  On the downside, the place is pretty tacky and the building is outdated.  But, I'm willing to overlook it once I realized the quality that they serve.  In short, Pedro's is arguably one of the better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!
Library Bar & Grill=Never have I been so disrespected by an employee at an establishment.  Maybe you should think about how you make money, and how creating a bad rap for yourself hurts only you.I went in last night for one beer about 9pm and sat at the little outside bar deal in the back. The female bartender was passing out calendars and drink coupons to everyone at the bar EXCEPT me. She totally skipped over me and when I asked "where's mine" I got a total fucking attitude. She told me I never asked for one and I explained I'm not a mind reader and she should have offered. She didn't offer to get more, she didn't apologize, whatever. A couple minutes later the couple two stools down from me said this is a great calendar and I replied that I wouldn't know. The bartender then flipped out and started telling the couple, not me, how she has no problem "owning these stupid ASU kids that can't handle their liquor." Way to judge, bitch. I'm not an ASU student and I've only had 1/2 beer at this point. I called for a manager and told him I have 1/2 a beer left, I'm not paying for it, I'm leaving and never coming back, and I'm going to tell everyone I know about how rude your bartender is. He gave me all sorts of free coupons for the block party, $1 drink coupons, and of course that calendar I wanted. I'm still not going back, ever, no matter hot skankily hot the cocktail waitresses are.Lame, the place is crammed and stinks. The drink was ok and the price was ok. Some "ratard" spilled my drink because he was oogeling over my wife while she danced on the bar. (can't blame him, and he did buy me another) doubt I would be back.
Olive Garden Italian Restaurant=I'm as afraid to write this review as I was to admit:...My love for Anne Murray songs..."I cried a tear, you wiped it dry..."...How sometimes I chew my toenails off...(and save them for salad toppings.)...That yes, once, once for a year or so, I smoked Capris Ultra Lights. Menthol. 120s. But I went to Olive Garden. And I enjoyed it. Stuffed mushrooms. Better than Oregano's. Fettuccini Alfredo...sauce clinging to noodles like The Hills girls to their careers....just barely and not smothering. The infamous salad...you know what?...quite good and with those galdarn breadsticks, almost orgasmic. Rickie's Marsala chicken...perfect...really! I had generic wine with great service and left very happy. Shout out to Stephanie especially who served and put up with a gaggle of urbanites in tacky paper tiaras. And a mini shout out to Susan who assisted for putting up with the gang but not having quite the mojo as Stephanie. Olive Garden. Ugh. Don't make fun of me for eating here. Don't reprimand me for clogging yelp with a tacky chain review. Just don't! I had fun. We ate. Even took home leftovers. I'm from Minnesota and have no idea what authentic Italian food is. I'm SURE this isnt' it. And those who complain that it's not are clearly delusional. IT'S NOT. But tonight was a blast and worthy of a solid 3.5 star review. Thank you for dining with us this evening and have a good night.-Consistant food.-Good service.-Not too long of a wait.-Parking was convenient.-Updated decor.-Area is questionable.
Bravo Bistro=I bought a Groupon for Bravo Bistro after reading other positive reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. The groupon was $44 which included a dinner for 2 (seemingly an amazing deal). It was supposed to include any appetizer, any 2 glasses of wine, and any 2 entrees. The groupon explicitly stated that the value of the deal was $124 (up to $16 appetizer, 2x$16 wine, 2x $38 entree).When I sat down to the table and explained that I was using a groupon, I was surprised when the house menu was taken from my grip and replaced with a small green piece of paper detailing the "Groupon Menu". On this menu, the most expensive entree was $22 and none of the large 2 person appetizers were included. My $124 valued groupon now felt like it was worth MUCH less.Needless to say, we were furious. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over an acted very smug while he explained to me that this was the groupon menu that I had to order from.The manger listened but seamed to care little that the restaurant was completely misleading customers with the groupon deal. After a 10 minute argument, he agreed to to "accommodate us" and gave us the normal menu back. I then ordered the Veal Ossobucco (my favorite dish and the reason for us coming to Bravo Bistro in the first place).I'm then told that they are all out of Ossobucco! Of course, how convenient. And they also wouldn't allow us to order any of the specials either.We paid for our two glasses of wine, left, and refunded our Groupon by emailing support@groupon.com.We'll never go back.There are plenty of great restaurants in the Old Town area. I'd recommend staying far away from this place -- Don't be temped by misleading groupon deals!
Brisam's=On a whim we tried Brisam's last night over Cocomo Joe's strictly based on Yelp reviews.  So glad we did.  It's got a great vibe, great staff and fantastic food.  The clam chowder is probably the best I've ever had in Phoenix.  My fiance had a spicy chicken sandwich that was top notch, I had the killer mac n cheese, and it was as advertised, killer.  Incredibly cheesey and huge portions, I had the rest of it for lunch today.  We split chicken strips as an appetizer, they were the only part of the meal that wasn't amazing, but they were still very good.  Our server was incredibly attentive (glass of water never got close to half empty and the restaurant was hopping) and friendly, and the host (also assuming the owner) dropped by the table a few times and was very personable.  We've lived less than a mile away for nearly a year, and had never even heard of Brisam's, but will certainly be back.
A Touch of European Cafe=Great service.  Make sure you call to make a reservation.  It can maybe hold 25 people maximum inside. Yes they do have outside seating, but it can get cold during the winter.  Even with the outdoor heaters going.  I like the home feel of the place, I felt like I was eating inside a friends home.  The food is the same as it is comfort food.  I felt very satisfied when I left.  The sample plate was great and gave me an idea of what the food was like.I did enjoy the service, nice home feel of the place, and the food.  If you want to try Polish food in Arizona, this is the place.
Mi Pueblo=-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place, but it is a casual sit-down, full service restaurant. They even had margaritas for $2.-REALLY good food, BIG portions! $9.95 for a Carne Asada plate loaded with guac, rice, and beans. Not super cheap like a 'Bertos, but decent prices.-FAST & friendly service! The food was brought out by the time we started digging into the chips and salsa...like SUPER fast!-Chips & Salsa were delicious with the wonderful taste of fresh ingredients. They also have extra "burn your mouth" spicy upon request.-Clean restrooms. Convenient parking.-Located in a 1/2 dead strip mall, next to Peter Piper Pizza on the west side of the Metrocenter Mall.-I would eat here again for sure!
Red Shrimp Company=Friendly service, mediocre food. With such close proximity to Chinatown, there's really no reason to stop here when better choices are a block away. Simple setup, Americanized dishes, relatively low prices, $15 limited-area delivery minimum.The beef & broccoli consists of a little beef, a bit of broccoli, and, inexplicably, a lot of carrots and mushrooms as filler? I like mushrooms but really don't care for carrots, this was an unpleasant surprise. Sauce was decently flavored but on the watery side. Portion for price wasn't as great of a value as I had anticipated.Wor Won Ton Soup was incredibly disappointing. Takeout container is packed with tons of chicken, some shrimp, and a lot of fresh produce, and the won ton skins held up well. But the broth is unforgivably weak and flavorless! Rice To Go (cheesy name and all) is a far better option for quick, takeout Chinese with better selection and quality, get thee to Decatur & Spring Mountain instead.
Pacific's Cafe=What the!! Am I really the first to review this spot? There have to be about 150 Yelpers within an 5 block radius of this place! But, no reviews! Makes me want to grab a can of spray paint and tag them!All righty then, here goes!I don't always need to make my own lunch or go someplace fun for lunch, sometimes you just need a good, serviceable sandwich or a bowl of soup, for a quick decent lunch. Someplace that isn't a drive-thru, isn't greasy (I suppose they could add grease if that's how you roll), congested (I mean in the automotive sense rather than then bronchial sense...although the fumes from most drive drive thru's make me long for a plugged sinus).Pacific's is a sweet little family run (apparently, they speak passable English and they always have trouble understanding me when I tell them my sandwich was terrific...a nice touch is that they all bow when I thank them...they are beyond adorable!) operation.They make, as noted above, a really serviceable sandwich (I'm fond of the egg salad with some chopped olives on it) and decent soups, as well. The place is very clean (they always hustle out to wipe down tables, even though they are busy behind the counter, making sandwiches, etc.), and smells good, too (like a good food joint should).I know they also do breakfast (which I cannot comment on...if I go out to breakfast, I want to make count with something like the Breakfast Joynt or Matt's).This little spot isn't easy to find, frankly. It has an Indian School Rd. address, but it's 1/2 block north of the street in the office complex by another one of the statues of Winfield Scott (we should start a new game and see if we can't find and count all of the statues to the Scotts...including that delightful paean to Mrs. Scott in the park...you know, the one with her on the horse looking like she has the worst case of constipation in American history).At any rate, try to find this place and have a sandwich. It's pretty good food, freshly prepared (like Subway only clean and nice), at a good price.
Casey Jones Grill=This was my favorite dive bar back when I thought a dive bar had to be absolutely rank. I recently returned a few times after years of having been away and realized why i had stayed away so long. The service varies depending who your server is. The beer is awful. Just a shitty selection. Really effing shitty. I seemed to remember their buffalo chicken strips being delicious but I must have been drunk out of my goddamned gourd. They were dry and had almost no sauce. Oh and don't listen to what anyone may tell you...LandShark is not tasty beer.I also remembered why this is the only bar I have been kicked out of for getting into altercations. Almost all of the patrons were ass hats speaking total douchery and making me sick to my stomach as they used their smooth lines on the waitress such as "Why don't you want to go home with my friend? He is hung like a horse. Har har har"Never have I been to a bar with so many children seated at the booths. "You have a baby!...at a bar...""OK so why two stars Nathan?" you may be asking yourself,  "you seem to be really getting riled up about this place, why not give it one?"The jalepeno cheese steak sandwich is sooo effing good. Dirty real dive bar food...sooo good. Go during the day when no one is there and do not drink the Land Shark...it is not tasty beer.
Sweet Cakes Café=Holy Shit! That was the best brownie I've ever eaten!The 5 Layer Brownie is 5 layers of Luscious Sinful Heaven!Devils food brownie base with cream cheese filling topped with chocolate chips, marshmallows and fudge OH MY! (see pics)I also got a Sugar Cookie frosted with cream cheese and a Giant  ginger snap the size of my face, both delicious! (see pics)Cute little cafe offering soup, Boars-Head sandwiches and a few salads, but it looks like there money  maker here is the baked treats. That's what I had and the other customers were all eating the treats too.They have about 10 different types of cookies and 7 or 8 bars, all generously sized and reasonably priced. I can't wait to try them all.5 stars for the brownie at least , maybe I'll try the food some time.Stop in for your 5 layers of heaven! You'll Thank Me Later~-Sandwiches are pricey. Nothing special.  $7.50+ (includes a pickle and small cookie.)-Lunch lines not very organized, moved slowly.-I would give 5-stars for the cookies, they are really GOOD!-Beverage area is in the next room, found this confusing. Too much chit-chat among employees behind the beverage counter, instead of helping customers.-Pretty decor. Plently of tables to eat at.-Very friendly employees.-Parking (1 hour) is along Main St or parking lot around the corner.This review is based solely on the baked treats here, but don't worry I'll be back soon to try out everything else on the menu too! But let's start with the sweets. What do I think? Well let me quote the famous yelper Sarah G...holy shit! First off, the store itself is adorable. It reminds me of a neighborhood family cafe in a small town. It's wholesome, clean, the staff is friendly and there's plenty of seating all around. I saw a boy comfortably doing some work in one corner and a group of chatty friends having fun in another corner. The baked goods are prominently displayed and it's hard not to leave with some...especially since they conveniently had a whole plate full of cookie samples! My waistline hates me but I'll deal with it later. It was well worth it! The cookies are reasonably priced for their size. They are $1.50 and about the size of small clock. They had oatmeal chocolate chip, sugar cookies with frosting on top, peanut butter M & M, oatmeal toffee, chocolate chip and many many more. Since I was in the area, I had to stock up for the weekend, so I left with three different kinds. I think my favorite is the sugar because of the yummy frosting and then secondly, I like the simple yet succulent chocolate chip. I will definitely be sharing with my bf otherwise I will be rolling down the aisle at my friend's wedding in a couple weeks!As I was about to walk out with my cookies, I was handed a brownie for the road. I couldn't say no and I am so happy I didn't! Before I was even 2 miles away, I opened the wrapping and took a little bite. You try having one of these little guys next to you without your will power taking a nap so you can take a bite!The slices of heaven known as the brownies are squishy because they are topped with ooey gooey chocolate. The ooey gooey chocolate is surrounded by marshmallows, cream cheese, chocolate and a secret sauce. I mean, it's got to be a secret sauce because they are delicious. They are rich, cream, chewy, delicious....etc etc etc. I see why
El Sol Mexican Cafe=El sol bakery is one of those places that everyone says "You have to go there" or "OMG....it is so good."  So over the past 5 years I have gone there 3 times.  Each time swearing that I would not go back for any reason, then like every victim of abuse I find myself going back to the same place that has hurt me so many times before, thinking "This time will be different."  and "Maybe it was my fault, if only I was a better customer.". The food here is good.  I have always liked the food, once I have gotten it.  But there in lies the problem with El Sol Bakery. Every time I have gone in to place an order for take out, it has taken over 1/2 hour for them to get the food to me.  Have you ever had to sit there and look like a dope waiting for your take out order?  Well if you haven't, let me give you brief snipet/summary of the conversation that played out in my head, wit my self.10 minutes after ordering:Man...this is taking a while....Can't rush good food... heh...Hmmm... lets look at my phone.15 minutes after:Boring...Hey! how in the fuck did that guy get his food, he just walked in.I am so hungry.Really?  That lady came in like a full ten minutes after me....This is horse shit.I did order didnt ?20 minutes:Am I losing my mind? Did they forget about me?Should I be a dick and say something?25 minutes:Berrber grrrrmmmdrib!Really?What the Fuck?She knows I am here, she just looked at me.Thats it. I need to say something.30 minutes:GOD MOTHER FUCKING DAMMIT!!! I AM LOSING MY MIND!All I wanted was a Burrito. That is it. A simple little burrito.I did order didnt I? Did I already say that? Hmm...what was the answer?Well did I?I have been here all morning.  It is going to start looking like I like to hang out here.That is it. I am going to burn this dump to the ground.  That'll teach em. I am not even hungry any more.And then sometime beyond 35 minutes, she brings over my order and I like the dope that I am just smile and say "Thank you" and walk out.  Why do I take such a beating over a stupid food item?  Why don't I ever say something?  Why do I go back knowing that these people are going to systemically push me over the edge?  Why does it take over a half hour to make a burrito?  Really it is not worth it.
Quiznos=I've never been a fan of Quizno's and this location in particular isn't great. The service is always subpar. When we approach the counter I always feel like I'm bothering them. They barely utter a word of greeting and can't seem to be bothered to even crack a smile or ask if we're ready to order. On every occasion I have been here I have to start the interaction which is a little annoying. We came here recently because I'm a Groupon addict and I just can't seem to resist. I'll stick to Firehouse Subs and Subway in the area instead.
Inside The Bungalow=As an update to my previous review, I have since learned that the staff here was extremely rude to my wedding coordinator and the caterers on the day of the event.  Very sad to learn that as I loved the place.Additionally, I had to contact them weeks later to determine the status of my security deposit.  At the time they explained to me the reasons why I was not receiving any of it back, and I won't argue that with them, it was in the contract; however, send me a letter or call me and let me know.  I shouldn't have to track you down to find this out.Not sure why, but I feel a bit like I'm in a fairytale land when I walk into this place :) Surely the 7 dwarfs or the mad hatter are sipping tea in one of the many nooks & cozy corners!The loose leaf tea is great. Take a moment to open up the containers & take a nice big ol' whiff before you decide on 'the one'. The best one as of now in my opinion also doubles as aromatherapy, lol! It's black tea & coconut, yum!The food is all made from scratch & so far I know that the Bungalow Salad, Curry Chicken sandwich & the Enlightened One sandwich are all FANTASTIC :)Add to all of this that you are in a lovely historic home & that the owners & employees make you feel like you are a wanted & welcomed guest & it all adds up to a truly relaxing & delightful experience.P.S. they offer yoga if you want to work off your food OR make room for more ;)Been here twice. Vastly different experiences; the first was five stars, and the second was 0, so I'll average it out to 2.5 and round down.I found this place via yelp, and I have to say I was not let down by the yelp reviewers who heaped praise on this place. Fresh, healthy food; lots of seating options including couches for lounging, tables for having lunch or doing a little bit of work, free wifi, and a very unique setting that's uncommon in the east valley. On that visit I was 100% satisfied; ordered a sandwich and sat for an hour or so at a table in the back.I raved about it a few times to my wife, knowing she would appreciate the garden vibe of the place and its healthy options. So one day, I convinced her to stop in and try it. She is 9 months pregnant and very uncomfortable, and was meeting me there with our hungry toddler in tow. Having just come from a grocery store with two small items that needed to remain cold, we were in an admittedly uncommon situation - needing to find a way to keep our cold food cold for the 20 minutes it would take us to have a quick sandwich. I chose this place that day because I remembered the great mom-and-pop vibe it had, and thought if anyone in the area could accommodate our need to refrigerate these two things (the size of small lean cuisine boxes, factory sealed), it would be these folks. I also had the realistic expectation that there might be some health code rule against it or something, so I politely asked, explaining that if we couldn't keep our food cold, we would have to leave. The owner was downright impolite - she had two large coolers/refrigerators, but said they were full of 'her food.' That was that. I explained that we just had these two very small items and if we could just borrow some space for a half hour, we would have a $30 lunch... she then held up a separate, portable igloo cooler that would have been perfect for our items, but still inexplicably said no. Another customer piped up and suggested a plastic bag with some ice in it, which would also have worked, so we both looked to the owner, who just said no and went back into the kitchen. It was honestly such a strange interaction, and goes so fully against the grain of how a locally-owned small business tends to act toward customers, that I have to boycott this place and recommend you do the same. Sure, they have a nice concept, but there are other places around that serve good food in a nice environment and who will treat me better. It seems like I'm in the tiny minority here on Yelp, so perhaps I caught her on a bad day. A very bad one.I've never reviewed before but I thought I needed to say something about this place. I wanted this place for my wedding more than anything. I saw it online and my fiancé and I decided to go to their open house they hold on Wednesdays.  We get there a little early and go in and check it out. I ask if I can have more informations on the weddings they hold there and the owner just hands me an information packet that is already online. She said the open house starts at 5 30 so I thank her and we go and wait. Her husband comes out and turns on all the lights and tells us we can look around and this is around 5 10. He tells us to go inside if we have any questions. I'm done looking and I go inside to talk and get more information. I go up to the owner and she claps her hands together and goes " ok it doesn't start till 5 30, thank you" and walks off. Really? It's 5 20 and you are standing doing nothing! why are you being so rude? Plus I was just told to come in here and ask you if I had questions!  We go outside to leave and her husband stops us and tells us he can show us and help us. Another couple comes in and she is nice as pie to them. Based on what that other review said about this lady I would never have your Wedding here.  If you own a wedding venue be prepared to be nice to people. I would have been ready to sign papers if only she was nice to us. Found a much better venue after this experience but wow blew my mind!Coffee was good but the service left a bit to be desired.  The older couple who waited on me started off pleasant but quickly turned on me as I requested a decaf americano ( i guess they like caffeine) with a pump of mocha ( he corrected me " chocolate") and extra room for cream. It seems the request for extra room was against the rules here.  Betty ( the lady making my coffee) gave me the look of death while the other guy suggested " sounds like a latte to me". So, if you want coffee your way- go to Lo Fi down the street, if you want it Betty's way then come here:) ps. if you are allergic to nuts, beware-they don't label  it as suchInside the Bungalow was like discovering part of downtown Mesa's historical treasure. At nearly a century old this charming home has been transformed into a whimsical café. The patio is inviting, the décor is delightful, and the friendly service immediately makes you feel right at home. I visited for the first time this past Saturday morning and my only regret is not finding the Bungalow sooner. I brought my Mom and daughter with the intention of ordering a coffee, or tea and perhaps one of their baked goods. To my surprise what we uncovered was a lovely café with more than meets the eye, be sure to look up the twisted chimney once you've entered the kitchen. There are cozy tables chairs and even books, magazines and board games too. They  drink menu consists of coffee and tea, espresso (hot or iced) Chai lattes, Italian sodas, twisters (blended drinks) in coffee flavors, green tea and creamsicle , and they offer smoothies too! The cashier offered the option of hot chocolate with whipped cream to my daughter's delight and even a few ice cubes to cool it down. They have several baked goodies; we chose a fudge brownie and 2 magic brownies (no not that kind) but irresistibly made with a graham cracker crust, coconut, chocolate chips, butterscotch and walnuts with two tasty Chai lattes to wash them down. They have breakfast and lunch sandwiches, even healthy options several salads, a Thai peanut tofu wrap, a hummus platter and a veggie pita.  While we were there  for over an hour I might add; they starting setting up their beautiful garden court yard for a wedding which they told us they host quite often. Open Mic nights are on Wednesday evenings so if your talented as well as hungry you can go for that too. This is sure to be my new home away from home, I can't wait to return. If you're in the area be sure to pay them a visit, you won't regret it!My mother decided to go here with coworkers for their lunch break because the food is diverse and can suit all their dietary needs, such as gluten free, corn free, and vegetarian. This used to be a place they went to often to eat a good meal. Too bad for the owners, they have lost the business of a large department of regular customers. Why is this do you ask? Well the story is a very dramatic one that does not reflect kindly on the owners of this little joint. Looking at the other reviews on this page, I would say that many other customers have received the same kind of treatment. The owner was atrocious. I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in an industry where you serve food and you have earned a reputation, chances are you're going to get a lot of customers. If you cannot handle that, you should probably close shop or hire staff to help out in the establishment. Today, the owner decided to tell my mother that they were not able to serve a party of 6 or more, and if they ever wanted that, it was required that they call 24 hours in advance. No where, not on the web page or in person, is this policy displayed. It is entirely new to our knowledge. Not to mention, they were not a party, instead they were a group of coworkers who happened to go to the same place at the same time. Coincidence? Not particularly when your place of work is close by. Two of her coworkers were taken aback by how the owner nastily told them about this policy and decided immediately to eat elsewhere. My mother and the last three coworkers were hungry and wanted to eat immediately. Upon seeing that they were staying, the owner decided to tell them that since it was only her husband in the kitchen, the food was going to be served very slowly. It was almost as if she did not want them as customers and was trying to get them to leave. They decided to order anyway, there was not much time to go elsewhere after the nice long discussion with the owner. My mom was the last to order, and upon receiving the change back from her purchase, the owner decided to rip into her. She explained once more, nastily, their policy of parties. My mom explained, once again, they were not a party. They were coworkers that were coming in for lunch. After this, while they were sitting at the table, the food for my mom was served first. She had to get a to go box because the service was so slow. She followed the owner back to the front to get a box, to which the owner decided she was hiring my mom without pay, and asked her to take the orders back to her coworkers. Strange thing to do when you're supposed to be the server. Couldn't even do her own job. I don't recommend this place to anyone. My own personal experience was not good there when it was like the world was over when I didn't want cashews on my sandwich and preferred peanuts instead. They really need to work on their hospitality skills.I met with a group of nerdy(bookish not loud) college students over the summer to review a team project. At 10 am, the place had no other customers. Of the 7 of us, 5 bought items. I bought three items which included food and a drink.As soon as we all sat in a side area, the staff member delivering our food explained that everyone must purchase or we all needed to leave. I was so embarrassed for the students who may not have expected the cost, since I was the one who had suggested we meet at the coffee shop. After the staff member left, I went to the counter. I explained why  we were meeting and that I could not order for the two people who had not ordered because I did not know their preference (I did not want to  embarrass them by asking) but I had purchased three items that I was sharing with the group and some of the other students had purchased two items. I asked if we could stay for at least half an hour . (We had just started outlining our who would be doing which part of the assignment.) I thought that she would see the logic and our situation. Instead, she explained that the owners could not afford to have people using the bathroom if they were not paying customers (the bathroom is not a locked, ask- for- the-key place--to their credit). I was told to make our meeting quick because two people had not purchased items. We had planned on staying for an hour, but because we felt rushed, we left with the project half-outlined. None of us used the bathroom. I have not been back since.
P.croissants=So I went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch. Which 99% of the time means real ingredients. I looked at the croissants and they looked unappetizing, the decription sounded good but the didnt look flakey or anything. Which was a sign of hydrogenated oil, for some reason it weighs croissants down and is not only worse for you than saturated fat it makes them taste like shit. I asked the woman if there was partially hydrogenated oil in any of the food or margairine which has trans fat. She went and get the 13 yr old baker. Who told me they dont make the icing which has partially hydrogenated oil. WTF!! why would I just go to the grocery store if I didnt care about the oil. I could get 7 unfresh pasteries for this price?The make there shit from a mix and have premade icing. That is literraly the dumbest thing I have heard of.  I am definetly sending them an email, because if they dont even make there food than there is actually no point.It's been a few months strong, but I am still in love with Pleaissant Croissant Patisserie!  How can you not be? The minute you walk in, you feel as if you are at a café in Paris!I now have had time to try the many items they offer, from flavored croissants, breakfast croissant sandwiches, salads, coffee, water, tea.Every single time, the croissants are soo light, buttery melt in your mouth good! I have worked my across most of the flavored one, though the Cherry Cream is my favorite all of them are so very delish!!So happy to have found this little bit of heaven!"Do you know on this one block you can buy croissants in five different places? There's one store called Bonjour Croissant. It makes me want to go to Paris and open up a store called Hello Toast."  ―  Fran LebowitzWoke up this morning to find some delicious croissants on the table and a mug of french-pressed Kona coffee all thanks to Mr. W.  This is how every morning should start off.  Being that it was a gorgeous Sunday morning, I sat down on the couch, dragged a throw blanket over my shoulders, ripped a croissant in half, and chewed on the most flaky and buttery croissant ever.  It was light, airy, and delicious.  I was lucky enough to grab a peanut butter filled one and had ended up splitting it with Mr. W.  Also to be tasted was a Bavarian cream filled croissant.P.croissants has been Mr. W.'s favorite place for croissants growing up, seeing that his childhood home is down the street.  I'm glad he's decided to share this treat spot with me.  I would love to come back and try some of their sandwiches!
Tom's BBQ=While visiting Arizona I was driving down Baseline Road in Tempe and noticed a place called Tom's BBQ Chicago Style. What caught my eye in particular was the signage stating that they carried Chicago Style Italian Beef. The next time I went down Baseline road I made sure to stop by and give it a try.I walked in to find a small restaurant. After looking over the menu I noticed they did indeed serve Chicago style hot dogs, and being the hot dog critic I obviously had to try one. I also ordered an Italian Beef as they had a big sign in front and I figured it must be a specialty of theirs, after about a 10 minute wait my food was ready. We'll start with the Italian Beef. This Italian beef was bland, they had the soggy part right. The bread was right, it had the right texture and softness. The Italian Beef meat itself did not have the usual Italian Beef seasoning that I find in Chicagoland. I've had worse Italian Beef sandwiches, but for a place putting this at the top of their signage I would expect it to be better.The hot dog was even worse. This was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog. The poppy seed bun was the right type (not a given in Arizona), but there was about three hot dogs worth of mustard on this thing. There was way too much tomato and too thick, this caused tomato water to soak the bun causing the bun to become soggy. There was a thick and watery pickle slice that caused the bun to be even soggier. The relish was also applied too liberally, while it was the neon green style of relish typically found in Chicago the application was just a mess. There were two sport peppers about the length of the dog between the two of them. Then cucumber slices and practically no onion. The bun fell apart as I attempted to pick it up, this was just a total disaster of a hot dog and puts a bad name on Chicago style dogs.Overall Tom's BBQ was a big disappointment. Despite signs indicating "Chicago Style" all over the outside, the two Chicago style food items I had here were lousy. Perhaps their BBQ is better but if and when I return to Arizona I'll take my chances elsewhere. Two stars for Tom's.
Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine=The quest continues on to Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine to find a decent dim sum spot in Vegas.  Chang's is a smaller venue compared to Orchids Garden over on W. Sahara.Arriving in the middle of the Saturday lunch rush, I was seated immediately, even without my party of four present.  The table set up was a bit awkward and I found myself rearranging the chairs and place settings before the rest of my dining companions arrived.The dim sum carts came rolling by and I do admit, they had a better selection than Orchids.  We immediately got the shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings.  We also ordered a few random dumplings in a more translucent type skin, similar to the shrimp dumpling skin.  The chicken in the black bean sauce was a bit drier than other places, and not as flavorful.  We tried mushroom on tofu that was tasty and had the beef rice noodle and shrimp rice noodle.  Both the BF and the cousin enjoyed their Soft Tofu, which was sweeter here than other places.I think we were impressed by their wider selection that we forgot to inquire about the elusive Shanghai dumplings or Shark Fin Dumpling Soup!  Next time for sure!I was craving some sweetness to close out my meal and had the Egg Custard Tarts.  They had three small tarts to an order and they just came out of the oven!  These were definitely yummy!  I would go back just for these!  They had the Pineapple Bun, but not the kind with Egg Custard inside.  Bummer.Service was okay.  Because the busboys are a bit overanxious to clear your table, they will consolidate your dishes for you. This is something I have always hated, unless it was necessary to do so.  I don't particularly enjoy watching the busboy bang the steamer against another steamer on your table so the lone pork dumpling will join the other lone shrimp dumpling just to have one less dish on the table.  I mean, for gawd's sake, are they short on dishes in the back?Overall, despite the lipstick mark found on the BF's water glass, I would give Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine a solid 3.5 stars.  They have a decent selection of dim sum choices, but could fair better on service and quality.  So far, they match up pretty competitively with Orchids for now.  But the search continues on to find a place that offers a wider selection and yummy tasty morsels of dim sum to satisfy this SF girl.Total bill: $40 and change, not including tip.Update! 10/26/07 - Recently hosted a dinner here for about 40 people in one of their private rooms.  There were some people that were really easy to work with and friendly, while there were a few others that could be a bit abrasive.Our menu:* Seafood Chowder soup - Pretty good. I have this soup a lot, but I never knew it went by this name.  Chunks of seafood and tofu in a thick broth.  * Peking Duck ($32) - The skin is separated on another plate so you can start using them with the twelve buns provided.  Then the duck meat comes along on a different plate.* Walnut Prawns ($13.95) - Jumbo shrimp with candied walnuts on a bed of broccoli.  Beautifully presented and eaten all up!* Mongolian Beef ($8.95) - Not a particular favorite of mine, but eaten up by my fellow diners.* Steamed Chicken, Country Style (half $11.95) - I like steamed chicken, but the chicken head can be a bit of a distraction for those who maybe shocked by it.  Light flavoring and with a little white pepper, yum!* Fish Filet with Blackbean Sauce ($9.95) - A fave by someone else, but it was okay for me.  I prefer my fish steamed instead of stir-fried.* Baked Pork Cutlet with Seasoned Salt ($9.95) - Tasty, but it looked like we got all the little bits while the other tables got the large pieces of pork.* Stringbean Szechuan Style ($8.95) - I prefer my stringbeans braised, or double fried.  This was pretty standard, nothing special.* Chang's Crispy Fried Noodle ($9.95) - HUGE order and loaded with veggies and seafood bits.  A good value for the money!Service wise - The food came too fast.  With so many orders coming out, our guests barely had a chance to make a dent into one dish before another dish would come.  There was never enough room on the table, and it would be nice if the waitstaff assisted with condensing the dishes onto smaller one (instead of just pouring them together).  They probably should work better as a team to make sure there is room on each lazy susan before coming out with each platter.  They were better at refilling water, tea, and rice pots in the beginning of the meal, but slacked off near the end.  They did bring us a knife to cut the cake (and offered to cut it for us too), extra napkins, to go boxes, etc.  Some polishing up on customer service overall could definitely use some improvement.  Overall, Chang's worked out well for our dinner party.  They were easy to work with in making our own menu and providing suggestions.  We also came early to decorate the room, which worked out well too.We were led to this place by our friend who is a local here. Morning dimsum on Saturday was a definitely fantastic idea, I have to say.The dimsum here was excellent. I am not that familiar with dimsum but man, every one of the dimsum we ordered was kickass good. I also wanted xiao long bao, and they had it on the menu, so we ordered it. The skin was a bit on the thicker side, but the bao itself was top notch. They also had egg tarts. Oh man, egg tarts. I lUV EGG TARTS!!!I wish I knew the names of the dimsum better. Guess my review isn't that useful after all, but I surely enjoyed their food =DThe dim sum here was hit or miss. I came came here with some family that were already in town right after I flew in. Some of the dim sum was 4 or 5 stars while most were really bland in taste. I've been here before and would have given it a 4 star review at my prior visits here. I was pretty disappointed overall with the food here the other day. Still, the dim sum here is pretty cheap though.We ordered the usual dim sum dishes which included a variety of dumplings, steamed dishes and fried goodies. We ordered quite a bit of food so I'm just going to highlight the goodies. The sticky rice dish, the steamed chicken paws, and a few of the fried goodies were all pretty good while everything else we ordered was mediocre at best.I might have to check out another dim sum place next time. This place isn't the go to place that I've always relied on it to be.every time i eat dim sum, two things are inevitable:1.  i always eat waaay too much 2.  i always wear a white shirt (not planned) and get splashes of soy sauce all over my shirt that ends up looking like ink blots on a rorschach test...run- on sentence...i know =)on my last trip, my friend and i ordered:siu maihttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=wjCjFIztbagVr9lHBQ0C5Qspare ribs with black bean saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=0MsGq9FNq0j8_DuU4mu_8gXLBhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=pcKfKHdWMaguiWGuQDuqrgsteamed bbq bunshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=5H8zdgaVzoRbIAw6EA_sOQsticky rice with shrimp and chinese sausagehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=A74GTaO1gsz24yRK3mttcgflat noodle with shrimphttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=4pxQ8iD5jGlfywsv-cWw5gsticky rice wrapped in lotus leafhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=ouW5rSHjWjJo-XKmp1bqRAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=tPsRoVF7rxbUFZKC-txU6wchive and shrimp dumplinghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=fZ9stiaNEPs-7ITysnN82Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=5Gy2f2LHSSG-vvqNM4zkGAfried smelthttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=d3Ry2bDDtXT5vtgw3mHjUwsmelt roehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=b0i870qndlOkZ3Qut0eLPQtofu pudding with carmelized ginger saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw?select=Cxihey8np1zw_pmyufDfpQdim sum at chang's is consistently good...i love that they serve dim sum EVERYDAY...they even have fried smelt on a weekday...although we had to ask for it...also noticed they have a larger selection on the weekends, but gets really packed...i suggest going early to avoid the wait and crowds...parking can also be a painChang's will definitely be our go-to place for dim sum in Vegas!On a recent weekday visit, I was concerned that we may have arrived a bit too late for dim sum.  But I was wrong!  A little before 1 and there was still a stream of leisurely dim sum eaters enjoying their lunch and reading the newspaper.  (This was definitely a good sign since many of the customers were reading the Chinese language newspaper!)Most importantly, tea was brought out to us before the food came.  Nonetheless, the dim sum cart ladies were more than happy to surround us once we were seated.  I did ask for them to give us a moment as we were waiting for the rest of our party (in Cantonese) and they were more than happy to oblige in a polite manner.Among the offerings, this is what we got:* Shrimp Dumplings* Pork Dumplings* Shanghai Dumplings* Peanut and Chive Dumplings* Tofu Skin Roll* Steamed Tripe* Pork Spare Ribs* Beef Rice Noodle Roll* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce - The first few carts didn't have this, but they were sure to let the kitchen know it was requested.  And the best part, they brought it to our table first when it did come out.  And that's how a dim sum restaurant should work!Our favorite - Egg Custard Pineapple Bun!  It was so creamy good, delicious and piping hot!  Look out for the ladies holding it on a tray because that means it just came out of the oven and it's definitely not something you want to miss!  (The Husband and I were still thinking about them later on in the day!)Prices for dim sum are:Small, A group: $1.85Medium, B group: $2.50Large, C group: $3.75D group: $5E group: $6.75(Seven of the things we ordered was part of the B group, with three items being in the A group, and one item in the C group.)Sure, they can really invest in updating their sign outside since it's fading so bad.  And one dim sum cart lady was a bit pushy, in a humorous way, as she joked with me in my poor Cantonese.  But once I ordered a dish from her cart, she was gone.  Empty dishes were cleared in a quick manner, maybe still a bit too efficient but workable.And they do have hot chili oil!  They will automatically bring out hot chili sauce, but let them know you want the oil and out it will come!$36 for party of three, tip and tax includedUpdate! (05.12.10)I just went yesterday for dim sum and they were still pretty where we had to wait for a short while for our party of four.  They apparently ran out of hot chili oil!  Argh!  So, we were stuck with the regular hot chili sauce. Bleh.  $40 for a party of four, tip not included.Chang's of Las Vegas is an institution.  When the Chinatown region of Las Vegas was just developing, I remember having a meal at Chang's and being impressed by the quality.  Fast forward at least ten years later and I'm glad to see Chang's is still around (now with two branches) and that their quality is still up to par. The majority of diners go to Chang's for traditional Hong Kong style dim sum.  However, for our meal, we came for dinner and ordered a traditional Chinese banquet.  Having eaten in Hong Kong, Vancouver, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, I admit I wasn't expecting much.  But after dinner, I came away quite happy and thought the meal was a fantastic deal as well.Service was surprisingly good and it's a surprise this place was relatively quiet of patrons.  It may be off the strip, but I can guarantee the Chinese food is better than most offerings on the Strip and of much higher and authentic quality.  Two thumbs up.A sampling of our menu:Appetizer plate - a beautiful presentation of Chinese BBQ items like duck and goose, alongside sliced meat selections, jellyfish, shrimp and seaweed.  Everything was flavorful and really started the menu off right.Crab claws - Deep fried crab claws fresh out of the fryer were hot and delicious and was served alongside what looked like deep fried seaweed.  The waiter later informed us it was the top part of the gai lan Chinese vegetable deep fried and seasoned with salt.  Unique and delicious.  No one wanted the waiter to take it away.Shark Fin Soup - classic presentation with good flavor and plentiful pieces of Virginia ham and chicken to complement the fin.Peking Duck - a whole prepared duck was brought out, skinned, and served to each patron in a bun.  They then sliced the excellent duck meat and served that as a platter as well.Braised Abalone with Chinese Vegetables - the abalone was not the least bit overdone and the vegetables were top notchSteamed fish - I believe a whole rock cod was prepared steamed with ginger and soy sauce.  Live and fresh.Wok fried lobster - a large lobster cut into pieces and sauteed with ginger and scallions.E-fu noodles - a wonderful side dish alongside the fried rice.Fried rice - standard fried riceOverall, we were extremely pleased with Chang's.  Service was polite and fast, entrees were delicious and plentiful, and prices were very competitive.  We all left with more leftovers than we knew what to do with and everyone had plenty of their favorite dishes.Next time you're in Vegas craving authentic Chinese food, you deserve to give this place (or it's sister branch) a try.  Chang's accepts credit cards, including American Express.Things have changed since my last review of Chang's, so it looks like another update is necessary!First off - the sign out front!  Yay, they got rid of that faded old sign advertising Chang's.  Although I'm not particularly fond of their tacky new font, at least it's legible! Looks like prices have gone up too!Group A - $2Group B - $2.75Group C - $3.95 Group D - $5.95Group E - $7.95For our hungry party of three, we had five items from Group A, seven items from Group B, and one item from Group C.They included:* Shrimp Dumplings* Pork Dumplings* Beef Ball* Tofu Skin Roll* Steamed Tripe* Beef Rice Noodle Roll* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce * Deep Fried Ground Pork Dumpling* Deep Fried Taro and Ground Pork Dumpling* Shanghai Dumplings (Group C) - It's something they don't push around in the carts.  You have to put in a special order for it.  Our order was had four dumplings, but you can request eight.  It came out piping hot - just the way it's supposed to be.  Be careful with the soup inside because it burned my tongue! The whole point of going out for dim sum is to "yum cha" which means to drink tea. Therefore, tea charges is as follows:* Tea is $.50/person* Chrysanthemum tea is $1/per personI wanted to end our lunch with something sweet and looked over the Egg Custard Tarts.  They appeared to be the same ones that were out when we first arrived, so I passed on that.  We also skipped on the Egg Custard Pineapple Bun this time around since we didn't see them come out fresh, and these buns needed to be eaten piping hot only!  They did offer the dessert tofu dish, but that's not my favorite.  Perhaps they need a better sweet selection or at least a higher turnover on it so things can still come out fresh! The service was surprisingly attentive on a Monday and there was no wait.  Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly refilled without us asking, which we really appreciated.  A large bus group did arrive shortly after us and did take up some of the attention, but it was understandable.Unfortunately, they do not have hot chili oil anymore, just the regular hot chili sauce.  I'll continue to ask for it in case they bring it back!3.5 starsService is non-existent, rude if any and racially discriminatory. Basically if you do not look Chinese or are not Chinese the people who work here are extremely rude.My husband (1/2 Chinese 1/2 Swedish) and I (100% Chinese) came here with our son (1 year old) for an early dim sum lunch. We have been coming to Chang's since 2004 but the restaurant is now under new ownership. We experienced the WORST, actually it was NON EXISTENT service. The hostess was rude when she seated us. She brought over 2 forks, ignored me when I said we do not need them and then slammed them onto our plates and walked away.When we complained to the manager he told us the restaurant workers bring forks to Americans. This in itself is racial discrimination/profiling, seriously who doesn't know how to use chop sticks?!?!? Do Japanese restaurants bring "Americans" forks? Do Italian restaurants bring Asian customers chop sticks? When it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seated us point blank ignored our raised bill in the air and purposely did not take it. At this point my husband walked over to her and tapped her on the back to give her the bill. She continued to ignore him and refused to turn around. He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.When we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back. Uuuuummm really? How else am I supposed to get a workers attention so they can DO THEIR JOB? Instead of being apologetic or recognizing the blatant discrimination the owner and the manager of the restaurant blamed us the customers for being a problem. I will never come to this restaurant again and believe what comes around goes around. The food is mediocre at best and the service does not exist. We are from San Francisco and have never been treated in such a manner at any Chinese or Asian restaurant.I've eaten plenty of dim sum in my life and this place fell so short of my expectations. It was a Sunday morning and they has just opened up. Ha gow were tiny and skimpy on the shrimp. The dim sum tasted like leftovers from the day before and wasn't fresh. Besides the disappointing quality - there was a very small selection to choose from for a Sunday. The service was so so and the prices were high for the quality of food received.I wouldn't even think about coming back here in the future.We were all in the mood for Dim Sum and decided to come to Chang's cause I've been here a bunch of times and it's always been good. Parking was easy as it wasn't busy, usually it's packed and I'll tell you why in a sec. It's on Decatur just north of Tropciana. Not far behind the Home Depot. The only reason I've giving this place 1 star is cause of the shitty customer service. Their website clearly states they do Dim Sum till 10:30pm. We came in and sat down looked over the menu for about 15 minutes while we drank our tea. We tell our server were going to do Dim Sum and he says no dim sum today because the cook left early. WTF!? That is the only reason why we came here and thier website says they serve it till 10:30pm!What's worse is they didn't tell us when we came in we sat there wasting our time. It crappie when this is what your known for and you don't have it. When I told the server about it and what their website says he looked at me like I was from Pluto. Won't be coming back for awhile, was quite disturbed.
The Lotus=I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. In my opinion, the Chinese restaurant lunch special is one of the best deals around. Why? Because for the same price or even less than a fast food chain, the Chinese lunch special usually includes a delicious entre with soup, fried rice, and sometimes an egg roll. Additionally, the Chinese restaurant lunch special is a chance to become acquainted with a Chinese Restaurant. If the food is delicious at a reasonable price for the lunch special, then the restaurant could be a great place for dinner or a date. Recently, the lunch special reacquainted me with the Lotus, when I took advantage of their lunch special twice recently.      The Lotus sits in the heart of historic Henderson in the Water Street District. It is diagonally across from the Eldorado Casino and City Hall. There is a small parking lot adjacent to the venerable building that houses the Lotus. On my visits, I parked in the Eldorado parking lot, cut through the casino and walked the short distance along Water Street to the Lotus.     The Lotus lunch special differentiates from several lunch specials on account of the fact that it ends at 3 PM in lieu of 4 PM. Additionally, the Lotus is one of the few Chinese restaurants that I am aware of where the lunch special includes wonton soup.    The inside of the Lotus is grander than it appears from Water Street. There are two dining rooms. Both times I  recently visited, there were relatively few people dining inside. Both times the host turned waitress invited me to sit in the dining room to the right. The ambiance is more casual and relaxing than a take out with a few seats.    On the two visits, I ordered a different lunch special combination for $5.95. On my first visit, I ordered the beef chow mein soft noodle style. It came with fried rice, an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce, and wonton soup. The beef chow mein was far better than what China Go Go and some other restaurants use as filler with the entrée. It was far better than a handful of fast food restaurants. On my second visit, I ordered the pepper steak that included the exact sides. The pepper steak was delicious at the same time that it had a unique taste that my taste buds would consider brisket. The wonton soup that came with the meal, complimented the meal. I wish more Chinese restaurants would offer wonton soup instead of the standard soup of the day that is usually egg drop or hot and sour soup. On visit one I complimented the beef chow mein with a Coke and on visit two I complimented the pepper steak with hot tea. With the beverage, tax, and tip; the lunch special totalled out at less than $10.   The waitress was friendly. I felt more like a guest in a person's living room with a sundry of tables than a diner in a restaurant. My favorite Chinese restaurants are the cozy places where I mentally feel that I am in a living room. Throughout the lunch special, she'd see to it that everything was good. Both times, she'd conclude my visits by saying she hopes I return soon. With a reasonable price for lunch specials that gives you a lot for the same or less price of a fast food chain in addition to good service in a cozy environment it us a possibility that I will return to the Lotus soon.
Khai Hoan Restaurant=This is some of the Best Vietnamese Food the valley. Nice little Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant in a tiny strip mall in Tempe. You will always see the same friendly family members there providing great tasty food and service. Inside is clean and cozy but simple. Gets busy really quick at lunch. On many of my visits there for lunch I see our hard working local law enforcement and fire fighters taking a break and enjoying a quick meal before they get back to work. Some of the tables are round and ready for a large group.I love the Pho there. It is so much better than some of the others in town and is packed with flavor. It comes with a plate of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and some lime wedges. The table also has all the condiments you may want such as schricha, housin sauce, fish sauce, etc. The Glass and Egg Noodle Soups are fantastic as well. Try the Bun which is very tasty and is an Angle Hair Noodle dish with the meats of you choice topped with scallions, peanuts, fried shallots and served over chopped red lettuce, herbs, cucumbers, sprouts and yummy fish sauce. One of my favorites is a specialty dish call Pho Ap Chao and is a plate of fried Crispy Rice Noodle Cake with Shrimp, Crab, Beef and all sorts of Veggies covered in a delicious light brown garlic sauce. So good.Everything is great here and they have too many dishes to explain them all. They also serve a large selection of Chinese food for those who are not in the mood for something different. Simply Outstanding!Here's my scaling system on how this place received 2 stars from me:  I came here with 3 of my co-workers for lunch, thankfully we were seated right away because this place was packed (+5 star). There was only one server, so we waited and waited and waited about 10 minutes before he finally came over to take our order, after he took the order of two other tables that came in after us (-1 star).  I initially wanted to order ban cuon dac biet #25, but the server told me "No, we're too busy, I'm not making that" REALLY??!!??! Isn't this a restaurant? Aren't you in business hoping to have a full house every day?  The item is on the !*&$*# menu!  Tell me you're out of it or something, not "we're too busy..." (-2 star, YES I deducted 2 stars for this).   I settled with #19 - Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong.  Two of my co-workers ordered basically the same dish I had, but added shrimp to theirs and one ordered the #1-pho.  They all enjoyed their food (+1 star).  I've had better, the grilled pork was thinly sliced and a bit overcooked, so it was kind of tough to chew (-1 star).
Coo Coo's Gourmet Coffee Cafe=You gotta love these locally owned cafes.  I sure do, especially when it's in Old Henderson. With a ton of coffee shops that boomed in the last 10 years like Starbucks and Coffee Bean, it's a breath of fresh air to see one of these older cafes still around.  Coo Coo's is definitely one of those hidden gems in the area.  Known for smoothies, coffee, deserts, and sandwiches.  It's actually their boba, that I came in for.  I was in the area and met up with T-Elite for a quick boba fix.  To be honest, I needed to break that "2:30 feeling". I had their Almond Smoothie w/Boba to do exactly that.  This treat was creamy and tasted exactly like almonds.  Imagine the initial taste of an Almond Roca.  Now imagine the taste and feel of boba immediately after that Almond Roca taste.  Well, that's exactly what you get here. Simply delicious!!There is a wide selection of different sandwiches that you can get here.  Coo Coo's is small and can house a couple of groups inside, but there's also seating outside.  I say take advantage when the weather is good and eat outside. I'm in this area at least once a month usually for work, the Henderson Police Department, and to visit both Wonder Twins (aka Alicia R and Terri R).  When in the area and if I'm in the mood for boba, I know Coo Coo's will be there to satisfy my cravings.I've been a customer of Coo Coo's for years--literally.  I started working in Henderson in 1997 (I'm old) and ever since then, Paul and his crew have been serving up good food and great service.  Most of the City employees eat at Coo Coo's or have food delivered, from lattes to Funky Monkeys to bagels and sandwiches.  The restaurant is on the small side, but there's outside seating and I know when it's too busy to eat there.  I usually show up around 11:30am if I'm going to dine-in and order online first so Paul knows we're coming.  He'll reserve a booth for us so we have somewhere to sit.  My regular order is the Ocean Spray sandwich (turkey w/ cranberry dressing) or the Veggie Delight sandwich (alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers).  Coo Coo's also started serving boba drinks a few years back and I get my fix almost every other week.  Coo Coo's is a downtown Henderson institution and I appreciate all the years of food and friendly service Paul and his staff have served up.  We've gotten to know each other over all these years and I'm sure I'm not the only one--it's like Cheers without the alcohol.  Thanks for all you do, Coo Coo's--let's stay together.It's like walking into the past, but it's in the present?...Ouch my brain. Imagine you're Marty McFly and you just got zapped back to 1955; well that's the vibe this place has as soon as you walk in. Black and white checkerboard floors, red leather bound booths and chairs with multiple old school movie posters on the walls. "This is getting heavy doc."This place is very tiny with only two booths and a few chairs, so you better not come here during the lunch rush or you're eating in your car. If you're on the run and need a bite, Coo Coo Cafe does offer phone-in orders that you can pick-up on the way to you're next appointment or if you wan to eat at home while you enjoy reruns on TV. "What's a rerun?"With plenty of parking outside, I pulled up, walked in and met the owner, who by the way also takes your food order. This dude has a salty demeanor, but I can tell he's the "big soft teddy bear" type. No messing around though, just order your food and sit down...cool with me I'm starving! I went with what he said was the, "local favorite" the Cali Sub w/ sprouts, avocado, turkey, bacon and swiss cheese. On paper this sounds pretty basic, but it was very fresh and piled high (see photo) with lots of goodies, plus the bread was super soft. Plush in the middle and toasted on top by a sandwich press. Let's be real, the bread can make or break a good sammie, right?!?! "That's right butt head"To wash it all down I ordered the "Kiwi Kooler" smoothie. This had a great presentation, but was a little on the sweet side for my taste so I only drank about half. All-in-all this place was a hit for me and my tastebuds. "Great Scott!"I will be coming back to check out other Coo Coo Cafe food options from their simple, but surprising menu. "Now, let's get back...to the future!"My tip best summarizes why am a fan of Coo Coo's Cafe:     " The best scrambled eggs that I've had in a restaurant the past decade; or come to think of it ever."    Coo Coo's is an appropriate name. You can say that I am coo coo for their scrambled eggs. Maybe with the exception of my grandfather's scrambled eggs, Coo Coo's is hitherto now the champion of scrambled eggs (in my opinion ). The two breakfasts that Coo Coo's served me this year featured scrambled eggs. I ordered the Hearty breakfast plate ($6.99) one visit and the smaller Petite breakfast plate ($5.39) the other visit. For $6.99 the Hearty breakfast plate with a coffee costing an additional  $1.95 is a grand deal. The Hearty Breakfast Plate includes three scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese. Coo Coo's Cafe made me aware that cheddar cheese with scrambled eggs is a winning combination. The cheddar cheese was equally as tasty as the scrambled eggs. I'd choose six slices of Apple Wood smoked bacon over two thick cut slices of ham or two sausage patties. I wasn't coo coo over the bacon. They were good. However, I have tasted better bacon. I'd choose sordough over wheat toast. In my opinion toast is toast. Being adventurous I tried grits. My memory has zero recollection of ever trying grits before I had breakfast in Coo Coos. When the food is good, it is a good time to try something new because you will be experiencing a quality portion of the food. Complimenting the food was quality Illy coffee.    When I stopped into Coo Coo's for breakfast, I left the fast-paced surface streets of Henderson to step back in time. It reminds me of a diner off US 66. The US 66 diner theme fits in with the Historic Water Street (downtown Henderson) District that is along the Boulder Highway corridor between the Freemont Street Experience and Hoover Dam. I could picture a Hoover Dam worker driving his Model T from Fremont Street on the way to working at the Hoover Dam site. In 2015, Coo Coo's Cafe with a walk along historic Water Street is a nice breakfast choice before the Clark County Museum or Lake Mead. Just pass over this suggestion on Sundays because Coo Coo's is closed.   The Water Street Historic District is more than the home of downtown Henderson. It is also the home of a small cafe serving first-rate scrambled eggs. This is my 4 star scramble endorsement of Coo Coo's cafe.
Pizza by Napoli=Make Great Success, The Pizza By Napoli Way!1. Find a major road (in this case Thunderbird) and set up shop at the nearest available crossroads. Don't worry about location, though. Given the size of Phoenix, the chances that you'll be a five-minute drive from AT LEAST THREE other dine-in pizza places is pretty low.2. Decorate the place once, and leave it. In the pizza game, you can never look too "vintage".3. The one or two guys with the heaviest accents? Put them on the register. You want to look authentic.4. Don't waste time worrying about a "diverse menu". Just serve the same pizza and wings as your competition. People don't eat pizza for the taste, they eat it for nostalgia, and with that decades-old decor and Old World accents, NOBODY will be more nostalgic than you, baby!5. Charge extra for everything. Soda refills. Ranch cups. When they gotta pay fifty cents more for it, it tastes better. It's science. 6. Since you're right by ASU West, why don't you offer a lunch special for all of those hungry students? Hey now, don't get ahead of yourself. Just offer two slices of your most generic (in this case, cheese) pie at a "reduced" price. If you make the slices light enough, they'll spring for a third or some wings. After eating Aramark food the other four days a week, college students will pay stupid coin for "authentic" pizza with a quirky "retro" feel. 7. Don't tell anyone that you're actually from Albania, and not Sicily. You'll lose your street cred.8. Uh...we thought we could stretch this out to 10 but that's really all you need. Oh, if you want you can set up an arcade machine (preferably one of a, yup, you guessed it, a 2D fighter...see? You're getting where we're coming from) in the corner just in case they don't want to spend their fifty cents to refill their mountain dew. You'll get those bastards one way or another.9...Very nice!?
Texaco Food Mart & Service=I'm on my way from Buckeye, AZ to Tucson and I forgot to fill the tank before leaving Buckeye, whoops.    I'm driving down the 85 toward Hwy 8 and am looking for an exit with both gas station at a reasonable price and a few fast food choices so I can grab some grub for the road at the same time.    I see multiple options and exit.I pass a few other stations and pull into this Texaco station.   I whip out my phone and the Yelp app, find this business and check in.    Whoa, what's this??   SURPRISE SURPRISE... it's telling me get 10 cents off PER GALLON with check in, YOWZER!!!!    This is the best check in offer I've ever gotten, YAY! I walk in and show my phone with the check in offer and sure enough when I get back to the pump, the price has dropped from $3.25 to $3.15 a gallon, SCHWEET!This is an interesting station, in that, it's a gas station with the usual mini-mart, but they also sell ornamental yard art, decorative water fountains, benches etc.   I'm glad I chose to stop at this station rather than the others right next to the off ramp!
Mi Comida Restaurante Latino=First off this is not a Mexican food place. I overheard a customer trying to compare and it's not the same. The food at Mi Cocina Mi Pais is  South American  with most entrees being Ecuadorian . The owner is Ecuadorian but realized many dishes from Columbia, Argentina and Peru were similar. In fact we talked to the gal next to us who is Colombian and was so excited to find food from home. The food was very delicious and we  are planning on going back and trying other dishes. I loved my fish in Banana Leaves  lots of orange, yellow and red peppers with a light white fish.  Tasty with a side of white rice and   bananas  fried  like chips. My hubby ordered carne asada  Argentina style , very spicy which he adores.  He also had chunky fried plantains . Everything was great. The place is small but the Host/ waiter / Owner's Son did a great job serving the 4 groups of people . The decor is bright and it's obvious they have a passion for what they do. This place is sandwiched in a small place in a strip mall but don't let that throw you off stop by and give it a try for something deliciously different.My kitchen, my country, my oh my what a great little offbeat restaurant this is.  Amidst a dying strip mall area on Bell Rd in northwest Phoenix you'll find an authentic Ecuadorian/SouthAmerican place that has food that will make you want to go back for more,.It's a family run ethnic restaurant that's very small and quaint.  Not hard to drive by, or not see it from the road as a Taco Bell is directly in front of it.  I really don't know why people would go to T-Bell anyway with Mi Cocina a few feet away.  I guess some people don't know better.The menu has many  different choices to choose from and if you have any questions ask the server/owner's son and he'll gladly help.  I'm a fan of the tamales, pork empandas, and shrimp ceviche.  Oh and I forgot the dessert.  As you're dining there the desset case is just over an arms length away screaming at you every minute.  I'm not a sweets person and even I gave in and tried some delightful indulgence.This is one of the best "finds" to be found in the Phoenix metro area!The world has finally presented me with an easy choice.  After years of wandering through life, decisions half-made or made wholly wrong, a simple and easy direction has shown itself to me: I have to move to Ecuador.Quite honestly, if the food here is representative of the native regional cuisine, I'm just going to buy a ticket, pack my cat, and head down there.  Feel free to pick over my belongings.Almost completely hidden from view, this tiny hole in the wall of a restaurant sits, waiting for those looking to find it.  The decor is bright and charming; inviting without feeling like it's trying to be ethnic.  The tables are comfortable and huge.  I had actually thought they were a bit over sized when we first sat down but, well, then food started to arrive.We were started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  And while they may not have been much to look at, these slightly greasy chips and sweetly spicy salsa are very tasty.  This little appetizer was soon followed by a plate of empanadas and a sampler of their tamales.  Now, I love tamales, so I was probably looking forward to this most of all.  These three (a Mexican red, a green, and an Ecuadorian) were not only beautifully crafted and presented, but they were some of the best quality I'd ever eaten.  If it's your first time here and you like tamales, don't pass that sampler up.  The red might not have been the most stunning, but the green is the perfect blend of cheese, pepper, and corn.  The Ecuadorian tamale was just unlike any tamale I've tried before.  Wrapped in a banana leaf, there was just more filling to it than I'd ever seen in your standard tamale.The main dishes followed in good time.  Again, the presentation on this food is just stunning.  If I had ever dreamed about being a food photographer, I'd probably start my portfolio here.  The brisket I had ordered was covered in what I can only term as a "salsa" of peppers and various other vegetables.  Combined with the meat that was tender enough to cut with a fork and the avocado slices, it was just a sublime meal.  A combination of flavors that I had honestly never experienced before.I've had (I think) real Mexican, Spanish, and a variety of other types of food.  The cuisine here is distinctly in it's own category.  I think that's what draws me back to it most: a delightfully inviting, yet wholly unknown, palate to explore.Loved it! Unique Ecuadorian/Peruvian/South American food with good flavors, excellent presentation and a good variety.The vegetarian plate comes with veggie flan doused with cheese sauce, grilled plantains, a mound of rice, lentils in a tasty sauce and a fried egg over easy, cooked oh so right.For those of you who aren't in the know, mash down the rice mound, salt it up, then throw the fried egg on top. Chop it up and feast! I love me some fried eggs & rice and they make the ingredients perfect here.If you're looking for some unique flavors & food combinations that are sure to impress, check this place out!Mi Comida is a new name for an old favorite.~Mi Cocina Mi Pais hasn't changed their staff or ownership, just their name.~I guess it was too hard for gringos to pronounce.Well, ¿Qué te hace pensar que este güero no sabe la buena comida?A brightly colored, spotlessly clean, and intricately decorated interior make you feel festive and also homey at the same time, as soon as you walk in from the strip mall, Taco Bell drive-thru-facing exterior.A friendly greeting, a bit of menu consultation, and a basket of chips with a spicy but perfectly balanced salsa was soon in front of me.My sandwich was piled high with thick, moist slabs of roasted, marinated pork that had the most savory flavor.  It came with a delightfully tangy dish of julienned red onions, pickled in vinegar, on the side.  I used up all of those yummy fuscia onion slivers on my sandwich de puerca; after a tiny sample, however, I left the pico-like salsa fresca alone -- too much heat for this nortero -- but it was a cornucopia of color and texture and flavors!¿Qué te hace pensar que este güero no sabe la buena comida?I have been putting off this review for a long time.Frankly. It has been intimidating to write. I want so badly to appropriately convey just how special this little restaurant is. I suppose there is no other way than to spill out all my blinding earnestness in one fell swoop, casually extolling every virtue this little mom n' pop restaurant offers."Mi Comida", formerly "mi Cocina mi Pais", is hands down, my favorite restuarant in all of the valley. Located  in the most unassuming strip mall, shadowed neath the coporate monster that is taco bell. Mi Comida is a south american restaurant, offering Peruvian, Colombian, and Ecuadorian dishes- of such quality and sagacious cooking method, you'll feel as if your very own south american grandmother you never knew you had cooked it all for you. The food is so good in fact i'd subsitute it for human relationships any day; this leaves you and your wallet: satisfied, happy, and full. I couldn't tell you what my favorite dish is, probably the entire menu. Every time i come here it is an adventure. Will it be closed? Will it be jam packed w/ adoring fawning salivating foodies? What will i order this time?Seriously i have ordered a different item each time, and NEVER, repeat NEVER was i disappointed. I have brought my parents here, my brother, my sister, my best friends, and even my ex girlfriend, and all entered a little skeptical and cautious, but left adoring fans. I'm not sure if it is possible to describe accurately how much i love this restaurant; and for the life of me i dont understand why the rating isnt a complete 5 *****! i'd like to sit down and chat w/ some of my Yelp friends and open a real dialogue as to why they only gave it 4 stars....i'm lookin at you Iain B.! lolWhether you live in Chandler, or Tukee. Mesa or PV make the drive out here (not you sun city folk you'll kill someone on the way)! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!If your blink twice while looking for Mi Comida Resaurante Latino on Bell and 43rd Ave you'll miss it!!  This place is small and not very appealing on the outside.  But it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception.  What an awesome little "Ecuadorian Gem" of a place this is!  Mi Comida reminds us of some of the best Peruvian, Argentina and Columbian restaurants we used to go to in Miami but without all of the flair and the high prices. This is truly a mom and pop, locally owned restaurant serving up delicious South American dishes.  This place is very small and quaint with some personality. They do fill up during lunch and dinner, so you may want to come early to get seated right away.  I was excited to see they serve several traditional South American dishes and delicacies which are somewhat similar to but also very different than traditional Mexican food.  I was excited to try their shrimp and fish ceviche served the same way we get it in our favorite Argentina/Columbian restaurant in Miami, which is in a large goblet, tons of flavor and spice, enough to serve two.  It was fantastic!  We had to try their tamales which are a little different than the traditional Mexican tamales.  I recommend getting their Tamales Sampler which consists of a red shredded beef tamale which was excellente' ~ wound up ordering a couple to go, a white green chili with queso tamale, also excellente' and their Ecuadorian tamale which had pork, tomato, carrots and cheesy goodness wrapped in a banana leaf.  This tamale is worth making a second trip back on the same day ~ lunch and dinner!   My friend had their Seco de Pollo ~ chicken stew which was a wonderful dish and a chicken empandas for an app.  She loved it.  Friend #2 had their shrimp stew for an app and their Bandela Paisa with chorizo, carne asada, plantains, rice and other goodies.  The carne asada was tender and delicious with just the right amount of heat and sauce.  It too was excellente'.  Their menu offers several options so don't be afraid to ask the server about the dish before ordering.  Try their empandas, tamales or ceviche as an app or pick several different ones as a meal.  You can't go wrong here!  You will leave satisfied, happy and already to planning what to eat on your next visit.I'm always a little cautious when I read reviews from people I don't know that state things like "this is the most authentic food..." especially when it's ethnic food and the writer is whiter than me.  Who knows, these writers may be from Ecuador and somewhere in South America, but what I do know is the food at Mi Comida Resaurante Latino taste as good as or better than some of the best South American restaurants I've been to.  They keep it simple with tons of flavor and lots of love! I hope to see you there.Real Deal great food here. I have held off on my reviews as I only have been there 2 times. The first time I tried what you would call a sampler platter. It had a little bit of everything. I scarfed it down and was wanting more! The second time was for lunch. I had an Empanada trio. Each one was so unique and flavorful I wanted more again. The staff is great, friendly and willing to talk for a bit if not too busy. This is a N Phx treasure for sure.Mi Comida is EXCELLENT.  I've been a dozen times or so (used to be called Mi Cocina Mi Pais, which means my kitchen my country).The food is 5 stars but be ready to explore when you get there.  Not much is typical about the menu.  Even the beers are not what you normally see.  There are 3 different types of ceviche.  The one with white fish is the star bur all are great.You must, MUST, get the Ecuadorian tamale.  It is wrapped in a banana leaf and just to die for.  They are darn big and run about $2.50.My wife almost always gets the chicken stew.  So simple and so yummy.  I have a hard time staying away from the Bandera.  It is a Colombian collection of rice, sausage, fried egg, plantains, beef and an arapa (a little cake of masa).  Yikes is it good.The fish wrapped in a banana leaf is also wonderful.  Every dish on the menu is a star.  I'd recommend you stay away from the empanadas and traditional Mexican style tamales.  Not because they are bad, but only because there are other much more defined stand outs on the menu.There are only 5 tables inside and it is located in a strip mall behind a Taco Bell.  Don't be fooled by the location.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry.  You must relax and enjoy.  Only one person cooks and only one person serves.The Chef/Cook/Owners husband or son will be your waiter.  The husband is hard to understand but it just adds to the charm.  The son is soft spoken and great.  The chef is classically trained and worked at the Four Seasons for many years before she started this restaurant making the food she loves and grew up with. Mi Comida is a special place.This is the MOST AMAZING PLACE EVER!!!!***** I feel in love with this small restaurant as soon as we walked in!!!THE OWNER Carlos is FANTASTIC and the food was the best Latin food I have had in my short lived life so far!!! It is simply GREAT, AMAZING, AWESOME, a MUST TRY!! **I had the Encocados de Camaron, it is shrimp in a milky coconut curry sauce with white rice, along with little plantain chips on the side, Mmm GOOD!! ** My best bud Shashi got their Carne Asada plate, which included a spicy, juicy carne asada steak with lentils and white rice!! I also tasted this and it was AMAZING!!!***Great place you MUST GO TRY, it was far from my home, but well worth the drive and wait on our plates, since it is all freshly made from scratch.** I also took 2 of the Guayaba cheese filled empanadas to go for my mom and dad!!THE WERE ALSO AMAZING, I had a bite or two!! :)THIS Little restaurant is my best friends favorite... and I don't blame him, this place is great!!! The food is oh so amazingly fresh and full of taste buds satisfying sensations to your mouth!!!_ Carlos, the owner is fantastic!! :)  Small place, but great food and great service!! :) Give it a try if you haven't yet!! The service wait time was moderate, considering it's own and operated by the owner and a small kitchen staff, the wait time then is understandable!!  MY MOST FAVORITE THING FROM THIS PLACE IS the must try ENCOCADOS DE CAMARON, AND the also wonderful GUANABANA SHAKE!!! OH SOOO GREAT!!!I loved this place so much that I started writing the review at the restaurant before I left!  The food here is delicious.  I tried 2 entrees.  Why not order lunch for tomorrow.  Haha.I had a fish dish and my all time favorite, bandeja paisa, actually a Columbian dish.  Both were delicious.  My dish was Everything I remembered about Bandeja Paisa.  Beans seasoned to perfection.  Steak marinated just right.  Even the plain white rice rated better than any plain white rice I've had.  It was cooked just salty enough and just fluffy enough.  Perfect!Don't come here expecting the traditional restaurant. This place is small.  I counted... There were exactly 6 tables that seat 4 people.  That's 24 seats!  don't go there if you are in a rush!  The food is cooked to order.  Home cooked food takes time.  The gentleman, Carlos, that waited on me seemed like he took his time because they understand it takes time to make good food.I even found that the folks in the restaurant were extremely friendly.  There was a regular customer there that day that kept me entertained the entire time I was there.  Keep in mind, this is a small establishment and it is not fast food, just amazing food.With out a doubt this is among the best places in the area to dine and it happens to be a little Ecuadorian Cafe. This place is tiny maybe only five tables and the only server is the chef's husband. I've been here many times before but I came very often and burnt myself out ordering the same few things so I decided to start fresh and try new things.They offer many ceviches including an interesting vegetarian variety made with Lupini Beans. I decided to try the Ecuadorian Style Ceviche. We were warned by the server it was very spicy and it was very spicy. It was fresh Cod in lime juice with tomatoes and pickled red onions. This was a very bold dish. They gave us dishes with spoons to eat it but I was getting too much lime and it would have been better with a fork. The pop corn sort of balanced your mouth from all the flavors in this dish. I thought it was a very generous serving.I really liked the grilled trout because it was seasoned just so and seemed to have a tasty wood fired taste on it. The fish wasn't perfect as the texture was a little off and ever so slightly over cooked but still very delicious. The salad that came with it was made with high end greens and had a tongue pleasing sweet mustard vinaigrette taste to it. I had my choice of side and picked rice. It was fresh and tasted buttered.I don't remember what my husband's plate was called but I think of it as a man plate sampler. It was tasty tender steak and beans, sausage, crispy pork skin, an egg, avocado, plantains two ways, rice, an arepa and a relish. It cost very little to dine here as my trout dinner was only $10.95 the value for certain is five stars.Mi Comida was the place picked for the International Supper Club UYE for September and I for one was excited to try them out!As others have stated this place is small, and if you are in a hurry, then skip it all together.  With that being said, we all arrived around the same time, and Carlos, who I guess is the owner, waited on us, and I have to say Carlos was amazing, gave us all personal attention, took each person's order one at a time and yes the dishes came out that way as well. But I have to say this was one of the best dinning experiences I have had in a very long time. I enjoyed the fact that we were not rushed and that we all were able to carry on a conversation and enjoy some great food! So if you are not in a hurry and are looking for great personal service, this is your place!I knew before I got there I wanted tamales! I have been craving tamales, but I didn't want the normal run of the mill tamales!  I ordered Tamale de papa, which on the menu said its made in the highlands of Ecuador, it was made with a potato cheese dough (hello this Irish girl loves potatoes!!) and it was filled with chicken, veggies and a slice of chorizo wrapped in a banana leaf, it was pretty darn tasty! Really enjoyed it!I also ordered the Pastel Crillo De Pollo - chicken, veggies and aji chilli wrapped inside a pastry puff, this too was delish!!    I crave/love spicy foods, and Carlos brought out some aji sauce and said that it was spicy, for me, it was lacking the heat, but made up for the amazing flavor it had. That stuff is delish! Impeccable service, excellent food, amazing company, hope to be back soon!Went here for the International UYE.  I have been meaning to try this place since before I was a Yelper. Glad I got the chance.  All of us knew there was one waiter and one cook in a tiny kitchen in advance so having the food come out as it was ready for each of us was not a problem and all of the dishes seemed properly done.  I wish more large groups and small restaurants would accept that as normal practice. As with any restaurant there were some items that were misses based on expectations.  Overall most of us liked what we had.  The owner ran the front of the house well while his wife/ co owner did all the cooking.  It was a very pleasant evening and the pace allowed us do quite a bit of chatting without feeling rushed.  There were also several good sized to go orders picked up while we were there.  I got the impression that they were not phoned in as it seemed folks stood around a bit waiting for their orders.We we're excited to try this place and so finally get to try it today. I've been looking at their menu since last week. The place was empty when we got there and it is a small restaurant.. Few tables, probably a total of 25 people can fit in there. So I ordered the sampler platter tamales (it has green, red & Ecuadorian tamales) and the Encocado de Camaron (shrimp with coconut milk). My classmates ordered Ecuadorian ceviche, Arepa con Queso (Arepa with cheese), Sango de Camaron (Shrimp w/ green plantain puree) and the Churrasco Ecuadorian (Angus beef steak). It took about 20mins wait for our appetizer and 15mins for the rest of our food. I totally understand, it says in the menu that everything is cook to order.The Ecuadorian tamale was good, it was wrapped with banana leaf and it was very moist, it has a different texture than the regular tamales, it's smoother. The red tamale was alright, it was a little bit dry. My favorite was the green tamale, it was moist and it's got cheese in the middle. The shrimp with coconut milk was very delicious, it was creamy and the shrimps were big and juicy.. I ate it with the white rice. I also get to try a little bit of everything and a sip of my classmate's green tea smoothie. I will come back for more shrimp w/ coconut milk, green tamales and the green tea smoothie!
Arby's=Received a coupon in the mail for a BOGO Beef & Cheddar Sandwich....so I dropped by this location to grab a bite.  I was starving when I arrived, so I over-ordered.  In addition to my 2 Beef & Cheddars, I ordered a Roast Chicken Club Sandwich and a Curly Fries....damn, there goes the diet!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/x0y6TU_03x7ZOjzKCiekkQ?select=8o1nt_uBhuouxxMs_yctaQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/x0y6TU_03x7ZOjzKCiekkQ?select=mNSs2QGULi0WF2mFyc5pyQThe Beef & Cheddars were ok.  The Roast Chicken Club was very good.  Of course, their Curly Fries are one of their signature items....and was solid.The kids working at this place were very friendly and were working hard to  keep the restaurant clean. I could hear them in the back talking about how to properly mop the floor and wipe down the tables.....sometimes the current generation gets it right.Return Factor - 75%
Gordon Biersch=Some colleagues and I stopped by here for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu, I decided on the Kobe Sliders, $10.95 that came with a side of Onion Strings.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Sliders were very good....and the Onion Strings were delish!Our server was very friendly and attentive to our table.  Our Iced Teas and Water glasses were never empty.Overall, it was a great lunch.Return Factor - 85%
Firefly=A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas. I went there with my mom and aunt and several friends and really enjoyed myself.They're open late and the sangria is also quite delicious!UPDATE:Do not miss the Thai beef salad.And skip the tuna tartare!I think I've found a place unique to Vegas -- don't know how true this statement is but it didn't have that chain feel to it.Located in a strip mall five minutes away from Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) is this spot that serves some really tasty tapas and refreshing drinks.  The one thing I will mention about the tapas: seafood dishes are good.Firefly is loud, crowded, and totally fun.  You got folks getting off of work and looking to unwind and chill, groups celebrating b-days, couples enjoying the setting, and a crowded bar with people waiting for the next open table.The staff is fairly friendly and very accommodating.  They were especially cool about my request for pitchers of caparinias instead of glasses.The only thing is parking can be sparse since Firefly shares its parking lot with Ruth Chris's -- so be prepared to search.Overall, local or not, you should give Firefly a try.WOW!I was completely blown away by this place.  My friend from Vegas lives and dies by this place, and I now know why!Upon our arrival into Las Vegas, my friend immediately decided that this is where we would be eating for dinner.  After a quick shower and some down time, we finally met back up with my friend and hailed a cab to Firefly.Miami needs a Firefly!  What a great ambiance.  When we first arrived, they were a bit crowded and we sat at the bar to have a couple of drinks and await our table.  Not too long after, we were seated in a seperate area that was originally the restuarant next door.  Great atmosphere and loved the decoration.  Low lighting, lots of use of the color red.  Totally my vibe!  :)I was advised that EVERYTHING on the menu is absolutely delicious, and that I MUST try the croquetas and empanadas.  Alrighty then, I said.  Here we go!  Oh, and the Sangria is a must-try too!Between 3 of us we had:*the Ham & Cheese Croquetas - OMG, delish!  Soooo tasty with the addition of the cheese!  A new fave.*the Empanadas (with Pork) - very tasty and cooked to perfection, with the crispiest, flakiest dough that melts in your mouth.*the Crispy Duck rolls - these were good, but not my fave.  A little gamey for my taste, and I usually really like duck, but the crispyness was good and I enjoyed the cherry sauce drizzled over...*Petite Filet - hands down my FAVE dish of the night.  The filet was cooked to perfection, and the mushrooms were just melt-in-your-mouth good!  The roasted potatoes that were also mixed in, along with the red wine sauce, were just PERFECTION.  :)*Manchego Mac&Cheese - what an awesome twist on a traditional dish!  I must learn to make this at home.*Tuna Tartare - WOW!  I've never had such delicious tuna.  It was not served as traditional thin slices, but in small diced pieces with a delicious sauce (not sure what the sauce was) drizzled over it, served on a bed of edamame and enoki salad with taro chips.  I would use the chip to pile on everything else on top of it and then eat this crunch concoction!  SOOOO GOOD!For dessert we all shared the Banana-Nutella sandwiches, which were ORGASMICLY divine!  My new favorite dessert!  SOOOO tasty.I give this place 5+++++ Stars!  I wish I would have had the chance to return while on my trip, but alas it was too short.  I will DEFINITELY be back here the next time I am in Vegas to try the rest of the items on the menu!Firefly is the kind of place we usually like to take visitors from out of town when they want something cool and hip, but without the chaos of the strip (nor the exuberant prices).They started us off with a plate of bread, buttery good stuff, and green olives as we checked out the menu.  To get things started for our party of five, we ordered a pitcher of sparkling sangria ($24).  To grub on...* Stuffed dates "bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese" ($4) - Everyone always loves these.  It's just a bite of intense flavor and goodness, and there's bacon!  About four to an order. * Terra y Mare skewers "grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde" ($10) - Came with three skewers, it was good, not great, but okay.* Firefly" fish sticks "fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs, spicy tartar sauce" ($6) - Arrived with two sticks per order.* Merguez "spicy lamb sausage, tomato-pepper confit, grilled bread" ($8) - A strong taste that gets some getting used to. The Husband was loving this stuff.* Pulpo asado "marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato" ($7.50) - The octopus was bit overcooked, not quite what I expected.  But then again, it probably was frozen and that altered the texture a bit.* Steamed mussels "red curry, white wine and coconut cream" ($8) - My favorite of the bunch, full of flavor in this red curry with two slices of toasted cheese bread for dipping.  I saved the sauce for my paella and bread.* Ahi tuna skewer "mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze" ($10) - Cooked tuna, which I don't care for too much.  Our friend got lured into ordering this by the waitress he thought was cute.* Paella "saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage" ($15) - Good stuff with lots of good stuff in it.  Tasty, and of course, even better with the red curry sauce from the Steamed Mussels dish.* Sparkling Sangria ($24 pitcher) - Enough to fill at least five glasses and really tasty too.  It's a light drink, with only a bit of fruit bits in it.  But definitely enjoyable by guys and girls.  We ordered another pitcher during our visit.Overall, some food times are good and standout-worthy while others can remain unseen.  The sangria is perfect for sharing and has enough alcohol in it for you to be feeling pretty good.  Service was better in the beginning with our waitress checking up on us and our dirty plates disappearing in a timely manner.  It slacked off a bit when our waitress didn't come around anymore and when the busboys were a bit overanxious in trying to clear plates that weren't empty yet.3.5 starsHappy Hour: Mondays through Thursdays: 3 pm to 6 pmFridays: 3 pm to 5 pm (1/2 off all drinks)Tuesdays: Latin Night, from 10 pm to 2 am (salsa, meringue, cumbia, rock, no cover)I live in LA and I come to Vegas every year for New Years and this is the one spot that I have to hit up each and every time.Four words = AMAZINGLY ORGASMICALLY DELICIOUSLY GOOD!!!!I think by now I've tried all the tapas on their menu already and I would have to give each tapas 5 stars each so that equals out to hundreds of stars total for Firefly. :DMy favorite tapas are:-Filet Mignon Sliders-Empanadas-Fried Calamari-Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms-Tuna Tartare -Crispy Duck Rolls-Ham and Cheese CroquetasEven their fries are off the hook because it has a hint of parmesan, herbs, and aioli and their Mojitos - I can get drunk off of that all day everyday. yUuMmMmmYlicious to EVERYTHING on the menu - no joke!We came here last time we were in Vegas and loved it, so last weekend when we were in Vegas again we had to come back.  We brought a Vegas resident friend who had never been here before and she loved it too.  It's a very cool place.  Both times we've gone have been during the day, but I can see how this would be a great evening date place, although from other reviews it looks like it gets pretty busy on weekend evenings.  Most of the dishes are small tapas plates so it's a great place to go, order a bunch of different dishes and share with your pals.  Between four of us, we had:Bread, cheese spread, green olives (free appetizer);Roasted eggplant cannelloni (with goat cheese and tomato sauce);Tuna tartare (with mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado and taro chips);Manchego mac 'n' cheese (baby shells baked with cheese);Empanadas (pastry stuffed with roast pork and red pepper, served with salad and aioli);Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms (we got 2 orders);Filet mignon sliders (mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales cheese and caramelized onions) (we got 2 orders);Crispy duck rolls (with cherry hoisin sauce);Firefly fish sticks (fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs and spicy tartar sauce);Chorizo clams (peppers, two kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts)Everything was great, but my favorites were the stuffed mushrooms, duck rolls and chorizo clams.  I guess I'm down for just about anything with chorizo in it.  Not only was the taste of the dishes great, but the presentation was fantastic too.  It's the kind of food you look at and even if you don't like something in it you can't wait to try it because it looks so good.The price was reasonable, with most tapas dishes costing between $5 to $10 each.  The four of us were stuffed afterwards and the total including tax, tip and drinks came out to about $120.  I'd definitely come back here anytime I'm in Vegas.This restaurant is completely amazing! The selection and portion of food is perfect, sometimes you go to tapa's places you get A shrimp with your order or if you are vegetarian there aren't any options. At Firefly they have it all- Seafood, Beef, Chicken, Pork, Veggie. . .Some of my favorites are Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Warm Spinach Salad, Stuffed Dates (TO DIE FOR), Diablo Shrimp-Truly have never had anything bad there. Also, the Sangria and Mojito's are phenomenal, but I will have to say, they made a damn good Dirty Martini!  Great place for a date, girls night out or starting point for a night out on the Las Vegas Strip. . . . Get there early though it get's busy!@FireflyLV on Paradise has long been known as an OFF the STRIP hotspot with hundreds of reviews,photos and news articles about it. Recently they opened a 2nd location at the Plaza in downtown Las Vegas and it has received an ever BETTER reception if that is possible. The view downtown seems to be all the rave:) My visit was around 7pm on a Thursday night since I've seen the crowds here on the weekend I wanted to avoid a long wait and I was delighted to be seated immediately. The place was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time eating & drinking. We ordered filet mignon sliders, fries, some lamb chops and the waitress recommended the bacon wrapped dates!!! No drinks this time The menu has a nice selection of tapas all priced very reasonably and the food is presented like those other higher priced chic places;) The food was incredible, the dates are fantastic, wrapped in bacon with crumbled bleu cheese in a red wine reduction. Soooooo Good I had 2 orders:) The lamb chops were great, cooked perfectly medium-rare in a nice wine reduction sauce with julienned veggies and capers. Really I could have ate 10-12 of the lamb chops and been good. The sliders I didn't like the cheese sauce I could have done without-maybe some dijon mustard instead-the filet mignon burger didnt seem any different than any other sliders Ive had. I like the crispy onion straws but I'll skip the sliders next time. The fries were good-nothing spectacular just fries with grated cheese. I'd like to see some truffle fries or something;) The dessert was outlandish-Chocolate and cherry bread pudding[warm w/port wine reduction, vanilla ice cream] -I could have ate another one. It was a TOUGH choice between the bread pudding and the Banana-Nutella sandwiches[w/Nutella cream dipping sauce] which the table next to us was enjoying:) My overall experience was fantastic the service was fast,friendly and quite helpful. The food was good. The atmosphere was fun & comfortable. When I left iasked the hostess if I could present the manager with something She looked at me a little strange but came back with the manager who was quite pleasant and accepted the TOP RATED RESTAURANT(#3) on Urbanspoon I gave him-telling me it would be given to the right person. UPDATE: To my pleasant surprise it has been placed in the menu marquee right outside the front door:)So... there was no seating available indoors, so my girlfriend and I agreed to sit outdoors. I don't know about you, but it's very hard for me to enjoy a meal (or anything) in 120 degree weather... until Firefly. You are amazing.Killing time playing Blackjack on a Saturday night before 8 pm dinner reservations at Firefly, we mentioned to our pert little dealer we were dining there.  "I *love* that place!"  she squealed, "Get the mac 'n' cheese!"  When we piled into the taxi later and told our driver, "Firefly on Paradise," he crowed, "That place is great!  Get the mac 'n' cheese!"Dinner at Firefly (which SIL found through Yelp) was for husband's birthday bash.  SIL had been working with the the manager via e-mail for weeks to arrange a group dinner for 13 of us.  For 2 hours and $50 a head, we could eat as many of the 6 pre-selected tapas (which SIL had chosen after reading the hundreds of Yelp reviews) we wanted, and drink as much alcohol as we desired.  SIL said that dealing with the manager through e-mails to arrange dinner had been a pleasure -- smooth and easy.We started with fresh bread and ramekins of almond butter.  Which was not the almond version of peanut butter I was expecting, but butter blended with crushed almonds, slightly sweet and delicious.  The tapas we sampled were:1) Dates stuffed with smoked almonds, wrapped in bacon, and drizzled with a red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles.  The combos of salty and sweet, chewy and crunchy, were really pleasing.2) Veggie empanadas -- airy, thin, crisp pastry filled with spinach, mushroom, artichoke, and herbed cream cheese, covered with red pepper aioli.  Remarkably interesting and flavorful.3)  Steak and mushroom skewers -- grilled filet, button 'shrooms, roast garlic cream, and a red wine reduction.  Meat itself was a bit tough but tasted good, and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.  Garlic cream was a phenomenal foil to the dish.4) Steamed babyback ribs with mango BBQ sauce.  Nice flavor, falling off the bone tender, but really fatty like a lot of ribs.5) Camarones a la diabla -- shrimp in a *spicy* chile sauce served with grilled bread. My personal favorite tapas.  Burn-your-lips spicy (in a great way) and explosive with flavor.  Shrimp were plump, juicy, and cooked just right.And finally...the pièce de résistance: 6) Manchego mac 'n' cheese.  After all the build up, after all the recommendations, you could practically here the "womp wommp" hovering over the table as we sampled it.  Sundried tomatoes were a great, flavorful addition, and the dish itself tasted good.  But it was soupy and not nearly as fabulous as we'd expected.  Dessert was small plates of caramel flan, chocolate tres leches cake, and banana Nutella sandwiches.  All three were delicious.We drank our fill of white and red sangrias, pitchers of mojitos, and bottles of wine and beer.  Service was wonderfully attentive and efficient.  Atmosphere was like a neighborhood bar: loud, crowded, and boisterous, everyone enjoying themselves immensely.  Ambiance was laid-back, very casual, and comfortable.  We were *so* glad we got off the Strip on this visit to enjoy a local favorite!  We weren't disappointed.[15 Minutes of Fame: "Rachael Ray's $40 a Day"]Love love love this place.Food: Stuffed dates-blue cheese stuffed and wrapped with bacon. What? You can't go wrong with these bad boys. Ham & Cheese Croquetas-just your basic ham and cheese popper, right? I think not.  I loved these.Pulpo Asado-pretty good. Not great. Perhaps a tad bit overdone, not sure.  Roasted eggplant cannelloni-light and fresh. Filet mignon sliders-tasty and substantial. Service: Great. No wait on a Friday night, but then again, it was around midnight.Attentive waiters, quick food turnaround.  Price: Each dish can run anywhere from $4 to $10 for the tapas and since you'll be ordering quite a few, it can get a bit pricey.  Throw in a pitcher of the must have sangria for $24 and you've got yourself quite the bill.  Still, in the town of excess, this is still a bargain.  This is definitely a must try place.I heart tapas and I heart Firefly. I don't go nearly as often as I feel I should. Can't get enough of this place. We had another get together here with some friends and had yet another fantastic evening. I love almost everything on the menu. The lamb skewers are always cooked perfectly. The dates are to die for. We ordered some other of our favorites; pitchers of blood orange mojitos, patron peppers, mac n cheese and some tortilla espanola. Yum, yum and more yum. Can't get enough of this place. Still need to try the location on Sahara, though.Tapa DelightThe Gist:*A random strip mall with pretty intense restaurants that inhabit the place*Cute little lounge*I think the table an inch away is eavesdropping...*Pitchers of sangria- too bad I'm driving straight to Cali right after!*Small dish of olives & "croutons" came out to entice the palate *Ceviche & both kinds of empanadas were good*Servers were nice & cleared out plates efficiently My quick visit cost me about $23 for three small plates. I'll probably want to give this place another shot to taste the "must-haves" of the menu...but that depends on if anyone else is in the mood for some tapas.My partner is suffering from food poisoning right now as I write this review - thanks alot firefly.  We assume it's from the chicken skewers or an apple salad - these are the only things I didn't try of his, Thank God.  We ate around 8pm on 4/25/11, he was throwing up by 11:30pm.  It's 2:21am now and he's still praying to the porcelain god.  This is horrible and obviously we will never come back - I feel disgusted and almost want to ask you for a fucking refund.  We weren't expecting a side of salmonella or e Coli with dinner tonight.  Also, thanks for ruining what was a great vacation thus far.My first impression was, "A hidden find off the strip."You wouldn't be able to tell from the outside all the goods this little restaurant has to offer on the inside. They have a cute little patio where you enter, and inside the ambiance is cool, mellow, and has a lounge/bar area. Little did we realize we were ordering plate after plate of Spanish tapas. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were typical of tapas entrees. We tried several, however, one thing that I crave and would definitely go back for were their stuffed dates. They were absolutely amazing. These little dates are wrapped in bacon, stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese, and all grilled under red wine. Sounds irresistible right? You'll see why yelpers rage about these little delectable bites. If you're planning on trying something off the tourist list while visiting Las Vegas, this is one you must try!The lasting impression? "Great place for small bites with a side of wine or a series of mini plates for a creative meal."My first impression was, "I'd be back in Vegas just for their bacon wrapped dates with toasted almonds and blue cheese."Here's a second review of Firefly after being there just a week ago and trying some more tapas plates with my friends. We first ordered a pitcher of red Sangria for the table since it was happy hour (1/2 price on all drinks) and of course, what goes better with Spanish tapas than a nice glass of wine? Our table of four had plenty of wine to share for just $14.00. It came in a pretty tall pitcher, well chilled, and with chopped apples inside for presentation.-Chorizo Clams (peppers, 2 kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts) the bits of chorizo mixed with the sauce for a sweet and spicy combination was delicious.-Steamed Mussles (red curry, white wine and coconut cream) the sauce which really becomes a soup is the feature of this dish. It was rich and flavorful and goes so well with the mussles!-Stuffed Dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) must try must try must try. Too out of this world.-Stuffed Peppers (Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce) The combination was good and they got a lot of cheese in the dish, but the sauce wasn't too impressive. I'd say pass on this one and get more stuffed dates. But good if you love your tomatoes and cheese, pasta sauce taste.-Mushroom Tart (puff pastry, boursin cheese) Simply good.The lasting impression? "Check out the photos, you'll be sold. It's a great place to go on a casual date or share a pitcher with little Spanish tapas and enjoy a good meal with a group of friends. It's a nice breather off the Strip in LV."In the words of the effervescent and poorly dress MC Hammer this place is: Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey! Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey!Located in a strip mall near the Las Vegas Convention Center, it would be very easy to overlook Firefly and run off to its more glamorous competitors...but I'm so happy we took a cab to enjoy this local favorite. The atmosphere at Firefly has a friendly and slightly frantic feel to it as it's packed to the brim with a mix of tourists and locals. We waited by the bar and met some really nice people who we chatted with and they offered us some of their food. Wow, how nice is that?!We were seated about 5 minutes after we arrived and were taken outside to another door which opened to the other half of the restaurant. I guess they expanded but didn't knock down the wall in between. We didn't really care, we were just happy to get a table quickly! As other reviewers have written the small plates can get pricey, especially if you've got a YELP sized appetite, but the food is delish! We ordered 10 different dishes and all you have to know is three words: Bacon wrapped dates. Do it, do it right now you fool!Yelp 365 Challenge: #48/365 (The Dates)There's nothing to say about Firefly that others haven't already said but I'd like to offer up a few thoughts.  For one, it's gotta to be one of my favorite restaurants to be at in Vegas.  The ambiance, the aura, and the sangria/cocktails (definitely a struggling AA members nightmare), are awesome.  Secondly, I love how fast the food comes to the table when you order something.  I like things done lightning fast so I was surprised with the 21-service rating in Zagat.  I'd have thought is would have been around 23-24.  The food rating is where it's at though 24 sounds just about right.  What I love most about Firefly though is how reasonable their prices are.Here's a listing at our recent visit:Pitcher Sangria - $28Boquerones - $5.50Beet Salad - $5.50Dates - $4Pulpo Asado - $7.50Steamed Mussels - $8Empanada - $4.50Crispy Duck Roll - $6Babyback Ribs - $9.50Lamb Chops - $8.50Paella - $20Not all of what we ordered was good.  But, all-in-all, NICE!  My favorites were the Empanada, Steamed Mussels, and Babyback Ribs.  Pretty decent dishes were the Boquerones (anchovies), Crispy Duck Roll (just the duck itself), and the Paella (although I can make a better paella with my eyes closed...paella is the only thing I can cook though).You can't do Vegas without a visit to Firefly for some quality food at reasonable prices!Eat It OR Beat It?**EAT IT!!**BEST tapas I've tried. The pitcher of sangria (red and white) is very delicious! Normally, people who visit Vegas don't venture off the strip too much, but Firefly is a restaurant you must must visit! The dates wrapped in bacon is my personal favorite!Forget spending 3x the money at the Bazaar in Beverly Hills for snooty subpar tapas... try this place out! CONCLUSION:If you're tired of eating buffets and want to mix it up, I recommend coming to Firefly! The prices are very reasonable and the food is rich and full of flavor! So, I say, EAT IT!!!!!!!!!!uh.maze.ing. You don't see many restaurants rated at 4.5 stars very often. And a local friend recommended this place as his favorite so we were intrigued. The restaurant is in a little strip mall of a parking lot- nothing too fancy. The dress is nice but casual and you don't need a suit. There are no stuffy white table cloths to be found. I'm sure they appreciate elbows off the table but I love any restaurant where I don't have to be conscious about proper manners. We went early around 7:30/8pm and luckily our group of 6 immediately got a table. The service was great, ambiance was perfect and the food was incredible. Order the pitcher of red sangria ($28). It was delicious!We ordered 3 plates each expecting little servings of tapas. We were surprised with the generous portions (small salad plate style) and was planning on ordering more but couldn't even finish those. I can't decide what was my favorite. All of these dishes woke up our taste buds: bacon wrapped Stuffed Dates, Tuna Tartare, Smoked Salmon Toasts, Filet Mignon Sliders, Crispy Duck Roll, Babyback Ribs, Fried Calamari, Warm Spinach Salad with strawberries.Trio of Gelato (pistaccio is my fav) and the Dessert Platter were yummy. The dessert platter was just a taste of all the desserts and just enough so we didn't feel like we were missing out. We couldn't have fit any more food in our bellies.I would skip the Fish Sticks (wish they would make them smaller and it was nothing special). And the Artichoke Toasts were the only disappointment. They sounded so hopeful on the menu but were served cold and in a chunk. It couldn't keep up with the rest of the wonderful plates on our table. And best of all, our bill was affordable and didn't break the bank.Ay Caramba!!!!I Love This Place!!!!On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! Then came our drinks and tapas!I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.Now onto the tapas...Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!Happy Eats!My girl friends and I must have ate Firefly's kitchen out.  We had 10 tapas and a pan of paella for lunch before, of course, dropping our guts at Encore Beach Club.  Sexy! The paella is an absolute must-have for $20 (Toto, I've a feeling we're not in San Francisco anymore!).  It was chock-full of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, chicken, and chorizo--I couldn't believe there was more seafood than saffron rice.  My favorite small plates were the camarones a la diabla (shrimp in spicy chile sauce), stuffed dates, and chorizo clams.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked in a delectable sauce--after we had all the shrimp, we hung on to the sauce and smothered anything and everything with it.  The dates were small, though tasty and complex.   The clams were in a lighter sauce than the shrimp but also delicious simmered in chorizo and white wine. I would skip the roasted baby beet salad, tortilla a la Espanola (Spanish omelette), and the lobster escargots.  There were barely any beets in the salad; the tortilla not only looked but tasted unappetizing; and the lobster escargots were so small I can't even remember their taste.I've had paella and tapas in Spain and at many memorable restaurants in the US.  Firefly doesn't come close to the top, but the prices are so reasonable (for Vegas!) and the selection is so vast (even the pickiest of eaters can't whine!) that I have to bump this 3-star tapas bar to 4 stars.  Plus, it's nice to leave the Strip for a meal!You know I do love tapas. Ever since Cha Cha Cha in SF, I've been crazy for tapas. After the many good reviews from Firefly, I came here with two friends to try it out. We wanted to order everything but tried to limit it to what we could eat. So we ordered:Lobster Escargot. A little on the mushy side. Portion is small. I'm warning you now so that you don't have a shock face like I did when I saw it. There's about five pieces. Good start to the food though.Filet Mignon Sliders. This was good. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Slight pink on the inside and juicy. There was also crispy onions on the side and along with two sliders. The aioli in the slider was a definite ingredient that separated Firefly's sliders from other places. Stuffed Mushroom. Chicken was a bit dry but I like mushrooms so I'm getting it anyways. Came in four pieces.Camarones Al Ajillo. About 6 medium sized shrimps and one hell of an amazing sauce. The shrimps were not mushy. The sauce went perfect with the bread given. Got to impress me with sauce when I go to tapas eateries.Along with our $30 pitcher of watermelon mojito which had Bacardi rum in it yet did not taste as strong as I thought it would, My friends and I were still a bit hungry. So we went and order the Paella. Not the best I've had. The rice a bit overcooked but the ingredients in here is absolutely worth your money. The seafood were plentiful and more than the average selection at other restaurants. Our total bill was about $90. We were full after for our party of 3. The restaurant is not too big and it's off the strip of Las Vegas. However, very much worth coming. Service was attentive, had no problem with it. It's located in a plaza so there is also lots of parking.Sitting in a fairly unassuming and cookie-cutter shopping center east of the Strip is this gem of a tapas restaurant. I hate the fact that every place uses the term "tapas" to mean small dishes when they aren't serving spanish food. Okay, so I'm being somewhat picky about the terminology, but it bugs me when I see a japanese izakaya that advertises itself as japanese tapas; an izakaya implies small dishes and pub food! Will dimsum be thrown to the curb to ape a more trendy term as well?! Okay, okay, that was probably out of line. Let's move on, shall we?Showed up with a group of six for a late sunday night dinner. No problem, we get seated right away a few feet from romancing couples and a table of near naked people celebrating halloween.  Off to a good start as far as I'm concerned.Here's the low down on what we got:Ceviche - tasty, there were larger and smaller pieces of shrimp and the bright citrus flavor was better than the salty watered down salsa versions I've had elsewhere.Stuffed Dates - wow, so good. The dates aren't that sweet and you mostly get the smokey bacon flavor with a hint of sweetness and a crunch almond surprise on the inside. The blue cheese goes really nice with it.Patatas Bravas - probably my least favorite out of everything we got that night. Tastes like big chunks of red potato. Meh.Thai Beef Salad - I'm not really sure what that thai beef was, but it seemed like a pancake made of protein with things mixed in. Tasted okay, but I wasn't in a salad mood which might explain why I didn't love this one either.Fried Calamari - Pretty straight up dish with nothing either outstanding about it nor bad. If you like fried calamari elsewhere, you'll probably like it here.  I'd probably save my stomach for something you can't find at every Italian restaurant on earth.Beef Empanada - These were really good if you like a flaky pastry with meat filling. The only bad thing was that there's two pieces to an order.Paella - Wow, by far my favorite! Order 2 per person so you'll never have to share. The chorizo was really good and I kept ignoring the seafood to snag some. I want a plate of this in front of me right now and I wouldn't hesitate to shoot a deer in the face to have it.What I'd want to try next time:Chicken and Chorizo Stuff MushroomsCrabclaw Corn DogsTuna TartareSausage PlateGreat place. Really dark inside (a table near us used their phones to read the menu) with an overabundance of those crappy paintings of spanish dancers shown from behind wearing a red dress that you see being sold on every cruise art auction.  Stop buying those paintings, people! They're pumped out of a kinko's printer in Cincinnati onto canvas!TL;DR: Don't buy crappy art; eat at Firefly now.Packed on a Monday evening!! I think we waited about a half hour.  Sangria!!! Firefly is a tapas bar located off the strip but absolutely worth the drive or taxi ride for those who enjoy awesome food, drinks and atmosphere. Sometimes it's nice to get off the strip away from all the gambling and tourists.Food and service were also great!-Ceviche - very tasty.-Thai Beef Salad - this might have been my favorite dish.-Empanada - good!-Bacon Wrapped Dates - a must.The three of us shared a pitcher of Sangria It's as good as the Sangria I make at home...which is really good!! We had a great time!1200 reviews and 4 1/2 stars? I had to try this place. Plus, it gave me another excuse for tapas! No reservations for Fri or Sat- but they take them any other day of the week.Sooo- we came on a Sunday instead. We had made reservations ahead of time and were promptly seated. For being a Sunday night during off-season, the place was still pretty crowded. There is very low lighting- so if you expect some amazing phone photos of your food, probably not going to happen unless you drown it in a flash.There were a ton of things that we wanted to try on the menu and the server gladly explained his pros/cons on each of our choices while recommending some of his own. There was no rush, but he continually checked in with us to see if we were ready or had any other inquiries. I was glad there were four of us- we really pigged out.While we waited, we went for their house sangria. Though I'm not a wine person, it was pretty fantastic. It was light and fruity, but after glass two, I was definitely feeling a nice buzz. We ordered a pitcher for the four of us and it was probably the better deal since we each got about two glasses out of it. If you're not lightweights like us, a pitcher between two people would probably be sufficient, too. It's definitely a great drink while enjoying your food.We inhaled:Serrano Sliders: Filet mignon with serrano ham, grilled onions and clouds of heaven. Not the menu description, but I think I heard angels singing when I bit into them. They were super moist, cooked medium and the cheese was melted perfectly in the soft, yet crispy bun. These were so amazing that I'll probably compare every other slider experience in the future to these little things.Manchengo Mac and Cheese: Came out in a little skillet that was still bubbling when served. It was crispy on top with a generous amount of bread crumbs. It wasn't too cheesy and split between four people, it was just enough without weighing us down. I loved the strong taste of the cheese and liked that it was so gooey without being watery. Even if there were two of us, I'd still probably order it again.Stuffed Dates: These sweet things were stuffed with blue cheese and then wrapped in bacon. The bacon was perfectly cooked with some nice crispy fat and it was unanimous that it was the favorite dish of the night.It comes in a serving of 5, so we all got one and I got an extra. I'm seriously salivating thinking of the sweet and savory combination and wish that they had a location in CA for me to indulge in... but it's probably better that they don't.Firefly Fries: It's a generous portion served with melted parmesan cheese on top. For dipping, it comes with aioli. The french fries were crispy and I loved the oil that they were cooked in. It didn't even really need the sauce that accompanied it and it was plenty for the four of us.Albondigas: These were like mini meatballs with the tomato sauce and parmesan sprinkled on top. They were delicious and moist and held some great flavors. As soon as they hit the table, we pretty much inhaled it. Definitely worth getting.Empanadas: A hit as well. Really enjoyed the flaky pastry outside and the super moist pork inside. The peppers gave it a nice little kick, but nothing a swig of sangria couldn't extinguish. It was so good, I again forgot to use the dipping sauce that came with it.Baked Tetilla: Just like the description says, it's fondue- so super cheese. It comes with crisp pieces of toast to spread the combo of cheese, tomato and chorizo on. We saved it and continued to dip our fries in it after the bread was gone. There was no way in hell we were going to let any go to waste!Fried Calamari: This was good, but standard calamari. It was good, but I would opt for something a little more adventurous next time.Tierra y Mar Skewers: Little kebobs with shrimp, filet and chorizo. I loved the charred tasted from the grill. The combination of these three proteins was pretty genius, each meat was delicious on their own and even better together.Chorizo Plate: Different types of thinly sliced chorizo served on a plate with capers. This was probably our least favorite dish. It wasn't bad, but we shouldn't have ended with it. It would have worked better as one of our beginning courses. It wasn't bad, but we had a bunch of hearty samples and this was light and salty. Banana and Nutella Sandwiches: Now this was the perfect way to end a meal. It was like crack and we almost ordered a second serving because it was so damn good. It was like french toast with bananas on the inside. Add in the nutella and it was the dessert of the gods. Super simple but extra delicious. This is a must if you're in the mood for a sweet finale.Service was impeccable. Someone constantly came around to clear our plates and refill drinks. This place deserves a 6th star and will become one of my regular Las Vegas stops for sure!HH (only alcoholic drinks 50% off) @ Mon- Thur 3-6 PM & Fri 3-5 PMFree appetizer bread, olives & sweet butter so yumny 10ptsTuna ta tare so yummy; great chips that came on the side 9 ptsCamarones a la diabla bit spicy & sweet 10 ptsSteamed mussels w/red curry...so delicious 11 ptsMango mojito wasn't too sweet... 9 ptsPear martini so yumny & perfect  11 ptsPatio area is great for groups =)Service was great; prompt & friendly.See those 2 stars up there? They serve as a reminder that no matter how good your food is, if the service blows then you've lost me as a customer forever. Came here mid-afternoon on a Tuesday, when it was lively but not exactly crowded. Our waiter, a diminutive Mexican with a thick accent and leopard mohawk which belied personality, came by to take our drink orders. I went with a traditional mojito and my gf got a sangria. Once they were dropped off, he came back to take our food order. We wanted to sample a lot, so I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, tuna peppers, lamb skewers, and fish sticks. Man, everything was awesome!My mojito was perfectly prepared. The bacon wrapped dates are astoundingly good. They're small, but each one packs a serious flavor punch. Tuna peppers were light & refreshing, with a slight kick. The fish sticks had a tasty sauce accompany them, but otherwise I wasn't overly impressed. But the lamb skewers rocked, and they came with a side of... ah, geez... it was either couscous or quinoa. It was great. Everything was so great, in fact, that we were dying to order more. But our waiter was MIA. I scanned the place for him - nada. The few times I did see him, he showcased his learned skills in the art of "how to not make eye contact with customers". After around 10-15 of this shtick, I gave up. Finally, I flagged down a busboy and asked for the check. Then our waiter magically appears with the check and asks me if I want dessert. You're joking, right? I told him no and handed him my card, since I didn't feel like waiting to see when he'd show up to collect my payment. He returned it quickly with a muttered "thank you" that sounded like someone forced him at gunpoint to say it. I gave him around a 6% tip, which my dad later told me should've been ZERO. Per his wisdom, a low tip only makes you look cheap, but no tip says "fuck you, you suck". Should've gone zero. I might return here - the food was so damn good I could make my mouth water just thinking about it, but the shit service had me so hopping mad after we finished that I couldn't wait to jet out of there. If you're a manager, tell the mohawked server to grow a personality commensurate with his hairstyle. You lost more of my money because of him, and I've got a sneaking suspicion I'm not the only one.FOOD POISONINGI hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant.I dined with a friend visiting from London  on 04//22 from around 8-10pmwe atefried calamaripatatas bravasTIERRA Y MAR skewerslamb skewerscrispy duck rollSerrano sliders (on website menu as Fillet Mignon Sliders)I am still recovering, but the worst of it was 04/24-04/27My friend, flew back to the UK 04/23  and has been in hospital since 04/26  and still has sever symptoms.This is terrible.All the best to everyone still recovering.1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.I ate there on April 25, the day before the board of health shut it down for 3 dozen cases of food poisoning. I choose firefly based on the comments on Yelp. From NY, and now back home and suffering from food poisoning from their cheap and bad food. Be warned, if they open again. What happens in Vegas does not stay there.I type this in my hospital bed so I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. I as ate here 4/23/12 with about 5 other friends from out of town to show off how amazing this place is. And it was another great dining experience.... 72 hours later or less and I'm in a state of what seems to be nearing death.  And it seemed none of my friends were affected but they were/are. I just happened to get it the worst!! I've been a firefly customer for 5 years! Never have I gone through anything like this. I may never come back and never recommend this particular firefly toAnyone or anyone coming to visit Las Vegas... I'm still in shock this has happened.  Most expensive dining experience ever. Thanks a lot.*** also this was no food poisoning I got for all you dim witted fools that think otherwise. Salmonella feels like and is (currently) Hell. SALMONELLAI got Salmonella poisoning from here. We ate there last Wednesday 4/23/13. Thought this was a nice place. Went to VegAs for my birthday and had dinner with 6 of my friends and every one of us got salmonella poisoning. One of my friends was hospitalized for 5 days. Ruined my trip, my birthday and now I can't pay rent because I've had to call into work the last 5 days. Thanks a lot I will never ever go here again.Never Again!This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for "renovations".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!This place used to be one of my favorites! But guess what? I was one of the lucky ones who got food poisoning. Obviously, I will never go back to this place or their sister restaurants, the way I felt for a week is not worth the risk. I was there with a friend and we had their sparkling sangria, rib eye steak with fries, stuffed dates, apple and manchego salad and mussels with chorizo.  Their service was great and their food taste as their usual, but unfortunately one day later I ended up getting salmonella. I was at a volunteer event when my symptoms started, I actually had to leave the place and go home because I could not even walk straight.  The diarrhea started when I got home and then the abdominal cramping came, it was as if I were a girl in my period. Gals, I know what you go through and I feel ya! I wish I could recommend this place, but my advice is: EAT THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Silver Mine Subs=Lets just say that I go here for lunch at least twice a week. As does the rest of my office. It is that good. Not just because its a hop skip and a jump from my building, but every sub I have ever had here, minus the Philly cheese steak which we will discuss later, has been tasty and fresh and simply delightful.I've tried The Dodge City - Pepperoni, Salami, Provolone, etc, .. The Caribou- Turkey Breast, Double Provolone, Avocado, LTM etc... & The Comstock - Roast Beef, Provolone etc.. I love everything about all of these EXCEPT for the fact that they do not *actually* use avocado slices, its more like, avocado paste. Not guacamole. Paste. Still tasty if you can get past the texture, but I would prefer the real deal. Now like I said, Ive also had the Philly Cheese Steak. Ive got to be honest. It tasted like vomit and old cow. There wasn't enough cheese and the peppers on it were overwhelming. Silvermine either needs to a.) alter this recipe immediately or b.) completely nix it from the menu. It was g.r.o.s.s.Let me give you a little money saving hint while I'm at it.. It is cheaper to order a sammich that has all the toppings you want then removing something rather than adding an extra topping to a sammich. if that makes sense.. At almost $2ea for some of them, ie: pasty avocado, you will certainly save a little.. especially if you eat here at the rate that me and my fellow Terraleverians do.The Silver Mine Subs' Tucson location got me through college at U of A, especially thanks to their late hours and delivery! Since those days, I've had this Silver Mine Subs in Tempe a couple times and to sum it up: they provide a decent sandwich that hits the spot but doesn't make me want to necessarily write home about it. It's just a decent sub that's especially good if you're in a huge hurry, you're kind of broke or you're hungry after the bars and need some food to eat on the cab ride home. I like that this location has a killer honey mustard they serve with their sandwiches. The bread is sofy and chewy and they offer a wide variety of toppings.
Breakfast Club=Ahhh...a restaurant with a name right out of the 80s. Bestow my heart! The BC as the regs call it, caps the end of little strip of shops in Oldtown Scottsdale. It is the Hugo's (West Hollywood reference) of Scottsdale. Lots of eye candy for boys and girls. The staff is mostly women, and quite the hotties they are. The space is very uncluttered and has great views of the passersbys and cars whippin' down Scottsdale Road. The oatmeal (add blueberries) is fantastic. The breakfast burrito is muy excelente. Orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and the coffee is strong and robust. Just like my Aunt Helen. The place is packed on the weekends, so expect a wait. Truly a hot,  hip spot on boulevard I call Snottsdale.The Breakfast Club sounds like and looks like it's going to be the best local place in town... unfortunately, I find it to be just average...Maybe it's just me because it's always packed!  Even today, on a Thursday morning around 10am, in the heat of the summer, it was pretty crowded.Anyways, the food is decent but I flat out received the wrong omelet today.  I ordered the mushroom fontina cheese omelet and I was given the mushroom, turkey, avocado, and cheese omelet instead.  Oh well - it was good, but not exactly what i ordered.  I will say, the portions are pretty big, and they are ok with substitutions... normally the omelets come with potatoes and fruit and I requested toast and tomato slices instead.  Coffee is decent and service ok (aside from delivering the wrong omelet).Tiffany C and I were pretty hungry and this certainly did the job of filling our bellies, but I probably will not rush back anytime so soon.  As Alicia says, MEH... not awful, not amazing. Not worth a long wait, but decent if you don't have high expectations!Long wait.  Ordered nutty pancakes,  Spied neighbor's great-looking omelette while waiting for said pancakes.  Tasted the cakes and wished I'd ordered the eggs.  Price-y menu made my mediocre dish even more disappointing.Felt out of place here with so many well-dressed, salon-bed tanned people. Breakfast is my favorite time of the day, and dining here brought my cheerful mood down fast.I returned to TBC this morning for a meeting with future yelper, Adriana C.  I'm giving them another star this time since there was no wait (9am on a weekday), service was prompt and attentive, and my coffee, oatmeal and side of egg whites came out just perfect!  It probably helped that I really enjoyed the company I was with as well.  Adriana's yogurt granola parfait and side of pancakes looked pretty fantastic as well.Lesson from this update: if you go to The Breakfast Club, go on a weekday and order something simple!An okay breakfast spot.The good news? If you're staying at the W Scottsdale you can walk here, it's only a block away. Oh and the W has no other breakfast options unless you feel like eating at Sushi Roku, yuck.The bad news? You'll likely have a bit of a wait and as far as breakfast places go, it's not that remarkable. Sure the eggs and bacon were fine, but nothing about this place says: kick ass breakfast. My friend and I were seated at the communal table. There was another random group of 2 seated at the other end. Two of my other friends tried to join us mid-meal (there were plenty of seats at the communal table) and were denied. The hostess said something about us dominating the communal table, not sure what that was supposed to mean but it sure was annoying.The Breakfast Club is awesome. It's one in a handful of trendy little breakfast spots in the Scottsdale area. It's located right on the north end of Old Town, the area is really chill and perfect for lounging on a nice day. So if there's a wait, which there usually is... it's not a nuisance to hang out; it's a pleasure! Like a lot of Old Town Scottsdale places, there is a certain hipster vibe you get from this place. If you go for a later breakfast like we usually do, you'll most certainly notice that about three fourths of the people eating there are club-goers from the previous night that went to bed way too late and drank too much while partying. Most of them look like they have not showered since getting home the previous night, and smell like a ridiculous mixture of B.O. and cheap cologne. Not exactly our crowd, but it does make for some fun people watching. They have a lot of dishes that are more on the adventurous side of the breakfast spectrum, but also have all the tried and true's as well. We opted with the cinnamon challah french toast which was very good and an omelet which we just loaded with all sorts of good shit... it was also quite yummy. It's also cool that there is a little coffee bar inside that you can order from while you wait or get stuff from to accompany your meal. All in all, we quite enjoyed The Breakfast Club... it's just a fun and chill little spot to grab a fresh and tasty morning treat.TBC has become a bit of a Scottsdale landmark over the past few years...I use it as a navigation landmark when I have people meeting me in town."Go north on Scottsdale Road and if you see 75 hung over people dressed in Affliction tee shirts and sequined mini-dresses, standing on a street corner waiting for a mediocre breakfast, you've gone too far...in so very many ways".I live (for another few weeks, at any rate) pretty close to TBC and yet, I don't really "go to there" very often (or at all) if I can avoid it.I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.In addition, the food and service have left me cold (much like my last omelet at TBC a few weeks ago) on my infrequent visits.But the amusement factor provided by TBC is (for me at least) quite high, and for that, I'm grateful!I've been twice in the past year...once for lunch, out of renewed curiosity (I was headed to another spot for lunch and saw a couple reading a menu outside another restaurant and discussing their lunch preferences in loud Scottish accents "I dinna want a fookin TACO, Angela...I wanna go to the fookin Breakfast Club!").That was almost a year ago...and I went once for breakfast, recently, because the Beautiful Carin likes TBC.And what Carin wants, Carin gets!But both visits featured mediocre food (esp. for the price) and mediocre service (at any price).My last visit also featured an apparently broken exhaust duct that runs under the booths at the north end of the place.Hot, humid cooking exhaust, coming up through the seams in the upholstery, steamy cooking aroma's wafting around me from below...I was about to call Guinness because I thought I was setting a new world record for sustaining a fart!But the aromatic breeze didn't stop! And even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!Our server was uninterested in this turn of events (when I let her know what was happening)...apparently I'm past the age when a 22 year old "model" (who happens to be slingin' hash) needs to pay any attention to me...even when they are theoretically being paid to do so!Maybe she wasn't being paid enough to listen to me...that's probably why some hookers get $2-3,000 an hour...to listen...bareback.At any rate, I was going to add a star to my review, since the warm air enema felt so darn nice, but what other restaurant can compete with that?It wouldn't be fair!TBC is clearly a club that doesn't need me as a member, and I'm OK with that.Don't you forget about me,don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me(Simple Mind - Don't You "Forget about me")The Breakfast Club was a cult classic in the 80's.  The Breakfast Club in Scottsdale does not disappoint.  Though not so much a classic yet, they do serve a mean breakfast - Yum! I ordered the Eggs Benedict while my partner ordered 2 eggs breakfast.  Eggs Benedict Arnold - haha! (Peter Griffin from Family Guy).  Needless to say I loved a good old fashion breakfast and they did not skimp on the portions.  (Enough for 5 mischievous students hmmm).  Like going back in time, back to the 80's, where breakfast was a time to stuff your face!  My eggs were over easy for sure while the soft and warm hollandaise sauce gently glazed over the eggs and ham.  Not too overpowering and just the right sweetness.  I had my hash extra crispy and my bacon; I like them soft and chewy.  I added some hot sauce and I had myself a grand meal.Will you recognize me? (After eating here and gaining some weight)Call my name and walk on by (A walk more like a run I'll need)Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling (More like falling asleep)Down, down, down, down (I go!)(Simple Mind - Don't You "Forget about me")The place itself had a business diner yet modern feel.  Not your typical dive diner for sure!  Service was spot on and keep that coffee flowing! - Enjoy!I had a good breakfast here, but even though I have an expense account when I travel for work, I'm still not comfortable paying excessively for what is ultimately a run of the mill breakfast. I had the cinnamon French toast, a side of scrambled eggs (served lukewarm) coffee and orange juice, and my bill with tip was $25. On the bright side, the service was a lot better than the Yelp consensus, just not enough to warrant such a steep price. Add Molly Ringwald to the equation and it would be well worth it, but without her this Breakfast Club is just a pedestrian experience posing as something it's not.This was my first time here and it was fun to meet up with some fellow Yelpers for a top secret UYE. Actually it was a great opportunity to meet Larry W from CA/TX as he drove through on his way back home. COOL!We arrived on a Saturday around Noonish and the place was super packed. They had a pretty good wait list and everyone outside looked very hungry.Ordered the Border Bowl and a giant glass of freshly squeezed OJ. Other members went with the Whole Hog plate, Eggs Benedict, a Caesar Chicken Wrap and some type of Veggie Dish.Everything was delicious and the portions were very large. The fresh squeezed OJ was definitely good and something I've not had in a long time. The Bloody Marys looked fantastic and were giant.We all had a great time visiting and the service was excellent. The menu has something for everyone and this would be a place that I'd bring the family back for a special occasion.The parking can be a little tricky and it is mostly behind the building. Just take you time and be careful driving in this part of town. The locals are pretty crazy and some of the streets nearby go around in circles. Dang shopping malls.See ya there next time and remember you can eat breakfast at any time of the day. There is no real written rule. ORDER UP!4 STARS
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant=BIERLY EDIBLEHere's the sad part of this review: I use to love this restaurant brand. I ate at my first one during Spring Training in AZ near the ASU campus. It was a tradition for us all to go there yearly for dinner & drinks and we always had a great time. Then on flights through SFO I would go and grab some of their famous garlic fries. I'm sure my airplane travel neighbors loved that as was we flew to China. Recently we had a team dinner here at the Vegas location and it was anything but good. I am not sure what has happen but the food is just terrible. I know they brew the beer fresh but why can't the food be fresh too. I'm not sure how this place is going to survive because there is just too much good food out there to be wasted on this stuff. We ordered a ton of apps and they were worse then warmed up Costco samples. The sad part is that we were paying for these & Costco samples are free. If I was the chef that designed this menu, then I would be embarrassed to tell anyone I even worked on it. The visit here left enough of a bad taste in my mouth that I may never ever visit another one of these chains again. For my entree I ordered the tuna blue and it was the weirdest piece of tuna I've ever had. The colors were not vibrant at all. It was probably the saddest piece fish I've ever eaten. My friend & fellow Yelper kept saying, "Your fish doesn't look right!" I used his famous line on him saying, "Never order fish in a desert!" It was the only way I could admit to my ordering mistake. I was just trying to be healthy. Guess what comes with my fish as a side?  Garlic Fries! Because noting says raw fish side more then garlic fries. Not!!! The kitchen couldn't even get them right. There was not a single chunk of garlic on my whole dish of fries. In the past this dish would be so garlicky that you couldn't talk to people for days. Not anymore. They were basically French fries missing any of its past glory. How can a restaurant go backwards on one of their signature dishes? It just doesn't make sense. All I know is that this place doesn't care about its food anymore. The temperature of the food was not hot which meant my dish was sitting while the other 12 dishes in my group were being made. It's not cool to send back a dish when you are trying to eat as a team. My buddy Tony M got the beef medallions and he really didn't care for it. Another co-worker across from us cut up her swordfish and didn't even eat it. She said it was really dry. It's sad to have a group meal where the food is pretty much tasteless and inedible. I really wish we would have gone to another place. The only app that was halfway good was the Southwest egg roll but honestly anything deep fried is really good. Except for the deep fried crab balls which were really crabby. I don't like eating crab which tastes like the sea. These things were really fishy. In fact, if I threw it into the ocean I am sure a fish would throw it back at me. The fried calamari was also not really good either. There was nothing fresh about it. The rings were really thin and it was more batter then actual fish inside. Service was good. Our waitress did a nice job of serving us except she forgot to bring our chicken wings. I didn't get the bill so I'm not sure if we charged for them too. Hopefully another table enjoyed a couple of baskets of wings. I felt bad for one of the guys in our group. He didn't get his food until 10 minutes after we got ours. Which means the chef didn't make it or the waitress forgot to order it.  If you come here then just stick to the bier. It is the only thing that is made in house. The food is an afterthought and the chefs don't really care. Food needs to be made with love and passion but that is not going to happen here. Stay away from the food.
Florencia Pizza=I have to raise this review of mine to five stars.  I went here again after a year absence, and have to tell you...Florencia's still rocks and it is even better than before!The up and comer in town was Rosies and now they are off the grid.  But Florencia's is still here and still making GREAT pizza.  Loving the pepperoni and sausage thin crust!!ENJOY!
Ming-Gee Chinese Food Restaurant=So, I just moved to the area and had a hankering for some Chinese food. What was a girl to do, but consult my trusty Yelp! app and see where it led me. Wel-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l......I must say this is the first time I feel like I've been led astray.You see, my go to whenever visiting a new Chinese place is a soup and a rice dish. I mean if a Chinese restaurant can't get that right then there's no way anything else I order is going to be any good. That philosophy hasn't let me down yet......hmmmmm now if there was just someway to apply that to relationships and I'd be a millionaire.........But, I digress..... back to the food. My no flavor won ton soup was full of ribbons of pork fat (no meat) that still had the veins running through it......blech!!! The house fried rice tasted like old pork, dried-out old chicken, old shrimps mixed with rice that had been fried up in at least 2 month old oil. To make sure I gave this place a fair shake I did refridgerate and attempt to eat the food the next, but to no avail I still began to feel ill immediately after.Now don't get me wrong. I believe all of the opinions about this place are true. But, I also think the lovely folks that live around this neighborhood must have iron-clad stomachs or they have been fed so much bad Chinese food it's been determined that this place is good. It's all relative????..maybe?????Unfortunately, the food I was served was illness-inducing. That's the only way I can honestly describe it.In fact, the following day I felt so sick after taking just a few bites of rice that, out of curiosity, I decided to check out the Dirty Diner report so I could find out if there were any Chinese restaurants around here worth going to. To my shock, but not surprise Ming Gee was at the top of the list for multiple violations. Many of the violations for things that would cause a person to have food poisoning. And that is why for the first time in my life I threw away $20 worth of food with no regrets.To add insult to injury I too was charged this mysterious 12% another Yelper mentioned in a previous post. Funny....when I took my total pre-tax bill and multiplied by 12% my handy-dandy little calculator showed I should have paid more than what I paid. Then I thought maybe they're taxing more the dish that contains shrimp, but even that did not add up. p.s. I waited a few weeks to write this review to see if any other reviews showed up. WHY???? Because there has been a big, fat CLOSED sign on the front door for at least the last week. So-o-o-o-o-o-o my question is how is it a few people have eaten at this restaurant in the last 2 days when the place hasn't been open within the last 2 days?.......hmmmmmm?????Bottom Line: I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone. You are risking your health by eating there IMHO. Also, if their doors do open again expect to pay a higher amount than whatever total you are given online or over the phone.
Pop's Philly Steaks=I WANT ONE IN LOS ANGELES.NOW.BEST PLACE EVER.easy going. great meat. fresh bread. juicy steaks. delicious. oh my childhood was awesome. i miss home.My mouth is open...insert cheesesteak please! I like this joint. I also like their sweet potato fries with coconut dipping sauce, mmmm yummy. You can smell the goodness just driving pass this place.Order to go and take your sandwich home to enjoy, That is the only downfall is it is on the corner of a busy street and there is only outdoor seating and it is always windy and the passing traffic noise and smell of cars whizzing by is annoying, tried this once for five seconds, was it enjoyable...not so much!Anyhow to order big so that you get full make sure you bring your largest wad of money, not exactly the cheapest place in town to get grub, for two of us to each order a large sandwich and an order of sweet potato fries and one soda. it set us back $38 bucks, seriously. Not the spot you want to hit up when you are low on cash and trying to grub. lolIn the worst of times people often think of the best of times.  Rex is no exception.  Gather around kids and let Uncle Rex tell you a story...when Rex was a small child he spent many a month on the East Coast. It was a magical time.  My father, who beat young Rex mercilessly if Rex called him anything but "The Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora", was originally from the Northeast.  My father was an odd man, a brutal man, a man with big dreams and small child like hands.  On my fifth birthday he brought Rex with him as he knocked over a 7-11.  As Rex helped him tie up the store clerk he let me pick any one thing Rex wanted in the store.  Young Rex wandered around the store, trying very hard to not step in the pools of blood, Rex saw the object he wanted...Rex turned and said "Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora can Rex have THAT?"  He nodded.  Rex kicked the 87 year old man laying on some of it...and picked it up. It was a bag with a delicious cheesesteak in it.  Rex danced. Rex smiled. Rex took the wallet of a crying soccer dad.  Rex was happy.  Rex and Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora drove down the street, the sound of sirens in the distance fading...the smell of the cheesesteak wafting into Rex's young nasal passages.  A great cheesesteak is a gift from above.  A wallet filled with 20 dollar bills and an unused condom...icing on the cake.  After we divided the ill gotten booty, Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora always took 70% (until I turned 9...but that is another story)...Rex ate his cheesesteak.  Perfect bread. Juicy shredded meat. Perfectly cooked onions. The right amount of whiz. Juice ran down Rex's chin. Juice ran down Rex's hands. Rex shook in delight. That memory, and the 8 months Rex spent on the run after Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora ratted him out...will always be with him.Pops Philly Cheesesteak is not only an insult to that memory it is an insult to all things with meat, cheese, bread or even hot foods.  The front page of the their website has a picture of their pitiful attempt of a cheeesteak...one of one of their abominations has green pepper on it. GREEN PEPPER!!  Let me explain something to all of you who are not from Philly...IF there was a place in Philadelphia that put green bell peppers on their cheeseteak...THE CITIZENS WOULD BURN IT DOWN!!!  It is ABSOLUTLEY 100% NOT ALLOWED IN ANY PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA!! Even if asked they WILL NOT DO IT!  So, first and foremost this is NOT A PHILLY CHEESESTEAK PLACE!!! IT IS NOT! END OF STORY!Apologies. Rex passed out and needed a shot of "Happy Serum" to get up right again...what is "Happy Serum" you ask...heathen...it is 1 part gasoline, 1 part peach schnapps, 1 part wiper fluid. Anyway, now that we have established this is not a Philly cheesesteak, let's talk about it from a cheesesteak on it's own merits.  First, the rolls are good, the sad part is you can tell the bread is shipped frozen or frozen after it gets to Pops.  Big mistake. It really messes with the bread. It isn't bad, but again it isn't East Coast good.  Cheese...never enough. Never. If you get provolone instead of whiz it is almost non-existent. Shame on you for skimping on the cheese.  The Whiz isn't bad sometimes but more often than not there isn't enough.  The meat isn't bad. It is done well, with one BIG problem...it is often dry. Not enough oil or cooked and then recooked, whatever the reason it is not great.  If you get to Pops on the right day and get lucky, and order correctly, it isn't bad...but the overall consistency is not there.Lastly...the "Philly" part of the menu...the Tastycakes, the birch beer, the rest of it...all WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! At Glaziers Market you can get all the stuff for 1/5th of the price.  Here is my biggest problem...Pop's plays on East Coast memories and locals who don't know any better. That is the biggest crime. It isn't Philly. It isn't a great cheesesteak. It is over priced. It is inconsistent. It just isn't right. It just isn't good.  Most of you will never know better unless you go back east (and my next review for Pizza will tell you how to find GREAT east coast food), and they KNOW you don't know. Pop's has been a place I have tried off and on for almost 8 years.  Rex wants to love it. Rex needs to keep trying every 2 years or so...but much like when his father turned him into the cops at the tender age of 5...Rex is always hurt by Pops. Future Husband of the Multi Talented Pia Zadora and Pops...shame on you...you know better. Rex knows better. Rex deserves better. So does everyone else.I love Pop's! The cheese whiz is what I order with extra whiz and provolone (yep it is cheeeeeeezzzy) and onion. I am never disappointed. I love that they have "wise" chips as well.My husband can eat a whole sandwich and be satisfied I personally can only eat half then save the other half for later it is well worth the money. This last visit was nice because there was no line! Sometimes there is a line but it moves real quick. I recommend it to anybody that loves cheese steaks and all who think they don't.It is on a old school original A-frame wiener schnitzel and if it is your first time you can drive through the middle of the "A" but don't think there is a drive-thru to order food it is simply a place to get you back on the road you must park in the lot and walk up to the window.The "Mozzarella Sticks" and "Cheese Whiz Fries" are super yummy.You can sign up for their e-club and get coupons and deals.I have seen that they now have a food truck as well at a couple food truck events so give it a try!Pop's is fantastic! That sums up every experience I have here and what I have heard from everyone I know.  I LOVE this joint.  Ok, you probably want more info on it, so here you go:1. These cheesesteaks are big and tasty.  They are stuffed full of meat and toppings on soft, flaky bread. I've tried a couple and have loved them all.  My faves are the 3 cheese steak and the Mushroom and cheese steak.  Delish!2. Choices on top of choices! Steak or chicken, then 3 types of cheese, add in all sorts of veggies, and you have a lot of variety. You never get tired of the menu. 3. They have Tastykakes!4. Lots of tasty sides like Cheez Whiz fries, Fried green beans, chips, etc.  Gotta love the sides.5. The grill man.  I've been lots of times and it always seems the same guy is working. He is super friendly and knows how to cook.  He's just cool and deserves his own line. Pop's has been on this corner for as long as I remember.  The food is consistently good, the staff is friendly, and you will always leave with a full belly.  What could be better than that?!?!While there is no ambiance to speak of except eating outdoors in the heat, a mister is present, and the food is really tasty.  Changing it up a bit, instead of my usual Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich, this time I opted for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich instead, and was not disappointed.  While not heaping with meat, the roll was filled enough; smeared yellow mustard on the roll gave off just enough tang to the moist, lean pastrami embedded along with it; and the overall effect with a side of Fries was quite satisfying.  I will most certainly be back!
Classic Italian Pizza=We tried Classic Italian Pizza for dinner last night.  We shared an appetizer of Aglio Olio and got two pies.  The appetizer was really good-the dipping oil is pumpkin seed oil based and has fresh minced garlic and a little fresh jalapeno for a bit of zing.  We could all use a bit of zing infused in our days, don't you think?I ordered the prosciutto pizza with kalamata added.  It was so good that after we got the check and my leftovers were boxed up I opened the box and grabbed another slice to scarf while I waited for the server to return.The four slices that made it home didn't even make it to see the next morning ;-(
Sam-Pan Chinese Restaurant=This is Americanized Chinese all the way but ohmigosh is done right and done delightfully.Sam-Pan has been a staple of old downtown Henderson for as long as I can remember.  I grew up on this stuff.  It used to be in a pretty ratty old strip 'mall,' but in recent years its been cleaned up.  The food, however, has always been great.Unlike other Chinese places, everything here is made fresh and you can taste it.  The sauces aren't thick with glutens (hooray!) and fired dishes are crispy, not greasy.  They offer an array of vegetarian items and the staff is always attentive and helpful.This is one of my grandfather's favorite places to dine.  He loves Chinese food and has traveled the US extensively and this little place on Water and Pacific remains his forever favourite.
Cheba Hut=I will never ever go to Quiznos or Subway ever again!  Cheba Hut is definitely the best and most creative sub shop around.I had the White Widow sandwich on a garlic herb bun.  It came with chicken smothered in ranch, cheese, bacon,  and mushrooms.  I also added peppers and mustard and it was completely awesome.  Looking at the menu, I realize that really whatever I am in the mood for, they have.  I would give it -1 star for not having green chilies, but I will survive (and so will be esophogus)Prices are very reasonable and I loved it that I had the choice of an 8" sub.  My biggest issue with the likes of Subway is that I could only get 6 or 12" when all I wanted was something in the middle.I found a new love in Cheba Hut.  YUMMY!!!! And the decor ROCKS!!!!!"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Mother mother fuck. Mother mother fuck fuck. Mother fuck mother fuck.Schnoise, noise noise.1 2, 1 2 3 4 Schnoise noise noise.Smokin weed, smokin wiz.Doin' coke, drinkin beers.Drinkin beers, beers,beers.Rollin' fatties, smokin blunts.Who smokes the blunts? We smoke the blunts.Rollin' blunts and smokin um'"Uh Lemme get a nickel Bag"15 bucks, little man, put that shit in my hand.If that money doesn't show then you owe me owe me owe.My jungle love.Oh e oh e oh.I think I wanna know ya know ya ... yeah, what."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-xKUU5sWS4~Jay If you don't know, then you can't go!I got the Griefo and added turkey, it had Pepper Jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole,sprouts,lettuce,black olives, mushrooms,cucumbers, pickles and tomatoes and 1 very thin and dry piece of turkey. (see pics)While I'll admit it was better than Scrubway and Schizno's, it would have been even better if I was high. Since I don't smoke I'll let you all commence with your bogartin' and I'll have to cite all the reviews before me with a RUI (reviewing under the influence).I shoulda bought that nickel bag form Jay..........Damn stoners forgot to make my food!!! How could you do this to me Cheba Hut?? I've loved you for 9 years! I understand the argument of not being allowed to watch the flatscreen TV during work hours is an important one, but being that apparently talking to each other is too big of a distraction to not miss orders, I'm gonna have to side with management on this one.Aside from the literal temper tantrum I witnessed by the majority of the staff with regard to the aforementioned TV, screaming obscenities and all, everything else was pretty crappy too. I got a salad for the first time ever at Cheba Hut, specifically the Southwestern Chicken Salad, and boy oh boy was that a mistake!! After waiting 20+ minutes for my shitty salad, I am handed a bowl full of brown-edged lettuce with mayonnaise-based chicken salad looking suspiciously like it came out of a can scooped on top.  Nowhere did I see the spicy marinated chicken breast, salsa, and other southwestern accoutrement I was promised by the description.The manager/owner/person of authority came out at the last second to earn this second star by giving me a free rice krispie treat for my troubles, which was freakin' delicious.This broke my heart Cheba Hut, as I pretty much survived only on your Dank Nugs and Kind Pinners through college, but you did me wrong today. Get your shit together, get some fresh (preferably local) vegetables, and get the whiny, pre-pubescent boys out from behind the counter and I'll consider coming back.Until then, thanks to the god awful salad and non-service, you guys are cashed.Daughter was in town visiting and said lets grab lunch, my treat, and off to Cheba Hut we went, she wanted to "shock" me because she thought I wouldn't get it, haha. Such a silly girl.It was my 1st time there and after checking out the menu, I went with a pinner Jamaican Red. We ordered our lunches and headed back to the house.This was a good sandwich, it was spicy chicken breast, bell peppers, jalapenos, black olives, cheddar cheese and I added all the fixings such as lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles & there house dressing. The Jamaican Red had a little kick to it, which I liked, if you like things spicy, this might be the one for you, but I kicked up a bit too and added sriracha too, and that was the perfect touch!Can't believe I haven't stopped into a Cheba Hut before, but now I am glad I did and am pretty sure I will be back to try another sandwich soon.
Salo-Salo Grill=My first experience with Filipino food..this place was suggested by a Filipino coworker of mine.   So we decided to give this place a shot after having more than a few beverages at the Freakin Frog.I got the chicken adobo which was very tasty...hard to describe the taste..almost like a garlic kinda gravy but the chicken thigh almost had a turkey quality to it..maybe it was the beer talking but that's what it seemed like and it was damn good.  For $1 extra, I got a beef soup and a bunch of mini egg rolls so the total came to $9.95 for a huge meal.  My wife got an awesome combo platter which included bbq pork, beef, chicken and red snapper (skip the red snapper if you go) which also came w/ rice and egg rolls all for $8.95!!  A steal!!  The setup of the place is pretty nice too.  Almost has an islandy/vacation feel to it if the front blinds are down and you're not looking at the cars going by on Jones :P  Super friendly staff that helped/suggested a bunch of different things for us to try too.Oh heck yeah I'm a fan.How can you go wrong with deep fried food?Rhetorical question.  Please don't answer that.There was an episode of the Simpson's where Moe decides to convert his bar to a restaurant and purchases a military grade deep fryer.In one scene, they show a complete meal (entree, salad, wine glass, flower in mini-vase all sitting on a tray) being lowered into this scalding hot vat of oil and coming out all crispy golden. That's what I had!And it was all good: fried chicken, fried pork, fried ribs, fried rice, fried fork, fried drinking glass, all served with a side of lechon sauce and/or banana ketchup.After my meal here, I had to eat salad for a week, but it was worth it.And once I've fully drained all this oil out of my system, I'm going back for more -- I'm talking at least a couple months.See you guys in December.Salo Salo is a great Filipino place to eat dinner with friends and family while in Vegas. They have plenty of seating, the restaurant is clean and they have good service and food. They also have good hours. Weeknights they close at 9:30pm and Fridays and weekends at 10:00pm. On a recent visit here, I came with a party of four and we ordered: kare kare (meat and veggies in peanut butter broth), sinigang soup (a sour soup with tamarind and meat), bangus (fried boneless milk fish), crispy pata (fried pork) and turon delight (banana egg rolls with Filipino ice cream). At the beginning of the meal, they give free garlic peanuts. This is always good and a nice start to the meal. (There are garlic peanuts for sale if you like the sample that they give). The kare kare was one of the first dishes served and I liked the presentation of the kare kare because they put this in a traditional Filipino palayok or clay pot. It comes out nice and hot and the peanut butter broth is perfect for topping off the rice. There was plenty of veggies in this in terms of eggplant and greens. The veggies and the broth is always my favorite for kare kare. I did notice their didn't seem to be a lot of meat in this though. (The veggies for me are the best part anyways). The sinigang soup was nice and sour and had a fair share of veggies and tomato. I liked sipping on the warm soup and it was also nice to top this on the rice along with the meat that was inside the soup. The meat they put in this though could have been a little bit leaner. The bangus fish they served was huge! I think our party only got through a quarter of the fish! The crispy pata was good. It was fried just right and was not to hard. It's good to match this with kare kare or sinigang. I also liked dipping the crispy pata in the vinegar dipping sauce that they provide. The turon delight was our dessert. Their turon delight is mini banana egg rolls (maybe about 8?) and then in the middle is some ice cream. The ice cream is a Filipino ice cream flavor - the night when we had it I believe it was jack fruit. This is one nice, sweet Filipino treat. I love all the traditional Filipino meals at Salo Salo and I also love how the whole restaurant has a traditional Filipino feel to it. They have decor that is very Filipino - Filipino paintings, wooden seats and tables. It is all prominently Filipino and makes a wonderful ambiance for enjoying a good Filipino meal.2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #4Salo-Salo was actually recommended by Roger T for us to go for our next Halo-Halo Challenge.  I admit, I pulled up Yelp, got on Salo-Salo's website, and did my homework on their Pinoy "Mix-Mix" dessert.  Based on their website, pinipig was in their Halo-Halo. Interesting...I gots to investigate.We arrived on Father's Day and this place was packed and there was a line.  Since we weren't having any food except Halo-Halo, they seated us right away.  Within 5 minutes, our Halo-Halo's arrived.  Each Halo-Halo cost $4.95 and what a beautiful sight.  First of all, real silverware. Always a bonus for me since it makes mixing this iced treat that much easier with real utensils.  Salo-Salo's Halo-Halo had what I've been looking for all along...real, legit ube.  Ube ice cream, green jelly, red jelly, some coconut, white beans, and flan were also at attendance.  But what was missing was the red beans, pinipig, and lanka. I was still stoked that I got legit ube. Taste wise...pretty damn good. Would be perfect if red beans made it to the party. PS:  We didn't have anything else, just their Halo-Halo. Service was fantastic, especially since they were so busy.Halo-Halo:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ#c0x5cS2wqTguAxEttK-iwg2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WAContender #8 (Fiesta Filipina):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-filipina-cuisine-henderson#hrid:VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHwMy sister in law swear to god this place kills all pilipino food around vegas. She has been here for alot of times now and this is first time coming in here. We already ordered when i found the news hee in yelp. :( it my fault i guess that i didnt check yelp before, I usually believe her when it comes to food. But this recent nrws really knock my appetite to the food. Yet Iam here to tell you that I didnt rate them because of the recent news (roach infestation.) Rather iam writing this rating with the same criteria I have been giving other food places.We ordered:ChopsueyPancit bihon And family set( includes ; bbq pork and chicken, squid, and arellanong bangus.RiceLets start with the chop suey. The vegetables were fresh and the flavor is there when it comes to the chop suey taste that filipino style shouls be but the chicken that came with the chop suey was dried up. So dry that we didnt touch it.Next the pancit, it was probably the one thing that i ate alot of on the bunch, it taste good, and has all the flavor i want frpm a pancit.Lastly the big family plate which contains different food, the beef bbq is probably the only thing that was near the taste that is near the standard of pinoy beef bbq. The chicken bbq was we only took 1 bite out of it, 4 sticks remained on the platter. The arellanong bangus was okay, but it tasted not fresh, as well as the squid, which i may add has only the bbq sauce on top of it, and smoked. I would have done better prepartion on it, no to mention , it tasted days old or refrigerated.Regardless of the ROACH infestation which we saw momenta before we eat, i find this place pricey with foods that are not as highly as other yelpers say.Maybe my standards of pinoy foods are high, but when a chicken bbq is so messed up that the bbq chicken that I make home made is way better than what you sell, then theres a problem. Lastly I would not reccomend anyone to eat here. I dont know if its true but they should have the GRADE C on their door, I may be wrong but its either they have never put it out, or they have been inspected again since January i cant find an update about the roach infestation.This will be the last time i will eat here, i took a chance to see if the flavor and taste are what the other yelpers said are true, even in the midst of knowing what might be back on that kitchen. Yelpers take this advice, and stay away, not unless you want be another brave sould to try out their kitchens delicacies.
Swensen's Grill &  Ice Cream Parlor=Many years ago I worked at a Swensen's in California . I was thrilled to have such a fun job scooping ice cream. The memories of those days has made me crave my favorite ice cream flavor  Chocolate Peanut Butter, a flavor that used to be my rich sweet special ice cream treat friend. Well yesterday I surprised the kids with a trip to Swensens I actually thought it was closed for some reason.  The place reminds me a lot of the place I worked at same oaky dark brown wood, marble tables , many of the same flavors of ice cream. They stil have loads of rich toppings and combination of flavors  . The bummer is the flavor did not have the butterfat flavor of Swensen's of old. It was tasty , it was good but not earth shaking, and I like my treats earth shakingly good. It is a quaint place , good for taking grandma out for an old fashioned sundae, kids out for ice cream after eighth grade graduation  or stopping for a treat with your kids.
Sonic Drive-In=Their commercials are everywhere, but I had to go to Arizona to actually try some.It's not bad, but it wasn't that great either. I got the #5: a Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster with tots and a drink ($6.29). The burger was alright. The tots seemed a bit dry.Are we supposed to tip the waiters that rollerblade to your car window?? I think that was the first time I ever gave a tip at a fast food restaurant.It's been a while since I've eaten at a Sonic.  What drew me in was a coupon in the mail for 2 for 1 premium Hot Dogs.  They have a new menu of premium Hot Dogs and they looked very tempting, so I grabbed my coupon and headed for this location.I decided to order:Chicago Hot Doghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=aQgi3VN_Cj_GKf6BsuD8CANew York Hot Doghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=3vkk0sdl_Fv-soALmxy0lgCheeseburgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Crz3YPKbXdRzftigOr62_w?select=xefpZG1PaZqwR9msB56xiwSince I'm a big fan of Chicago Dogs, I went for the Chicago Hot Dog first.  Based on it's appearance, it looked promising.....except the Relish wasn't colored Car Coolant Green like the real Dogs in Chicago.  I took a bite and was pleased.....it was "close", very close to a real Chicago Dog.Next up was the New York Dog.  It was OK, not as good as the Chicago Dog.The Burger was OK too......better than most fast food joints.The one weird thing about this restaurant location is that if you decide to dine inside, you order through a phone and someone from the back brings it out to you.....strange, very strange.Overall, not a bad fast food option.  Will come back for the Dogs again.  Gave it 4 Stars.....was really rounding up from 3.5.Return Factor - 77%
China Wok=This is probably the best tasting and fastest Chinese food delivery available in old town Scottsdale. The portions are big, so split one dinner and one appetizer and you're all set. The house fried rice was a little dry but flavorful, egg drop soup is packed with goodness (not just broth), the pot stickers are freaking amazing, egg rolls are very good too with extra hot mustard. *Lunch specials are the way to go before 3pm.
Dilly's Deli=For many years, Dilly's was my saving grace for a lunchtime option when I worked in Tempe. Although I could never escape the smell of fresh bread for the rest of the day, the quality of sandwich was worth the smell. Dilly's is a great deli if you need to get in and out in a timely manner while still being able to enjoy a decent meal along the way. Whether it's their salads or sandwiches, I am a fan of whatever they serve. Don't get me started on the sugar cookies. Those little bits of baking delight probably cost me a pound or two, but it was worth every bite. Any deli that serves fresh avocado gets a star in my book and not only does Dilly's serve it, they pile it on. The bread is always fresh (hence the smell) and the sandwiches are served with just the right amount of warmth to them. If you visit, here are my top choices:- If you like cream cheese and avocado, go with the Dilly Bird - Veggie supreme but add turkey- Honey Do if you are a fan of honey mustard - Greek Wrap - Clam Chowder Enjoy!
Brunos Pizza=I am from New York so you know I am super picky about food and my 300 pound stature lets you know I enjoy my food when I get it. So when I say this place is like home, you know this will be food legends are made from. IMHO it does not matter what you order, you will enjoy the meal like no other before. Priced right & they deliver!Another Yelp success story!  I've been looking for a neighborhood pizza and wings place and finally found it!  I'm very particular about my wings and happy that they measure up!  The pizza is great too and the antipasto salad is just right.  Add delivery and Bruno's saves me from cooking dinner!Been here a few times and the pizza is fresh every time, the employee is very nice which for me is very important when eating somewhere. Nice that there are 2 tv's on different channels, best thing is I live in walking distance.This place is small yet comfortable for my nephew and I. Felt like we were at home watching the suns game and eating pizza.The owner was so nice. I had asked him politely if she could put on this end game, instead. She handed me the remote control like I was family. Haha. She said whatever you need let me know.  Thumbs up.I ordered the ziti mushroom pasta, Holy cow they put way too much sauce in!!! Which was PERFECT!!! :)) it also came with a house salad and breadsticks. If I knew, I wouldn't have ordered the vegetarian pizza. But either way, the pizza was fantastic :) minus rhe olives. .. ( I said no olives) :/ We'll be coming back. :))We got 2 xlg cheese pizzas, we went and got them and the pizza was the best I've had here since moving to az.  The dough was awesome and the pizza was even better cold. I love cold pizza. So over all it was a very good place totally recommend trying.
Kyoto Japanese Restaurant="Real Japanese cuisine"  For all those that think Teppan style is authentic Japanese food I hope my yelp opens your eyes. Don't get me wrong I love to eat with a group of friends at Kyoto.  But know that the Teppan style cooking is an authentic tourist trap created by a chain restaurant owner in Japan.  The ReviewI like the Kyoto bowl for but a good Japanese food.  The chiefs create a great experience and atmosphere and the Sushi is pretty good.  I have eaten here a few times, and have had a saki bomb here or there. I learned the hard way how power full the drinks are so use with caution.Kyoto is an Old Town staple. It was there long before the endless miles of trendy restaurants, sushi joints and clubs. It was there when Devils Martini, Myst and Axis Radius were the "cool" spots to party and it was the place you'd visit for sake and Teppanyaki to get the night started right. But those are the days of yesteryear, the real question is: how is Kyoto now? Still chugging! So the decor isn't as trendy as some of the newer restaurants out there. So the building is a little run down. So there are cooler spots to visit at night. Who cares! Kyoto is fun, it has good food and the drinks are flowing and flowing...and flowing! I visit Kyoto when I want to sake bomb and enjoy fried rice that becomes a beating heart, a flaming mountain of onions, one heck of a fire show and of course hearty, decent food! Yes, it's cheesy but it's fun...especially when sake is involved!Kyoto is a fun spot for a group dinner when you want something lively, you want something close to the bars in Old Town and you want something that isn't too stuffy. Be warned, it gets crowded, so make a reservation or get there early.Kyoto continues to be a rockin' good time! Every time I visit, Kyoto provides an activity dinner experience! Between the saki bombs, the entertaining chef and the good food, Kyoto has the tri-fecta. Be warned that on the weekends, you will experience a wait, so it's best to call ahead and make a reservation.I've been to Kyoto a handful of times through the years... it's an Old Town Scottsdale staple.  Whether you're looking for sushi or hibachi; you're dining solo or with a group; you can find what you're looking for here, but you do have to choose between the sushi side and the hibachi side of the restaurant.I've been for both and neither has blown me away, but if you don't have extremely high expectations, this place really is A-OK.  Service is attentive and somewhat quick.  Prices are moderate, but if you're eating sushi, it can add up quickly!I do like Kyoto as it's not your typical Old Town scene; it's a bit on the older and more casual side, which I like.Some highlights from my last meal (and keep in mind that I'm pregnant, so I had to go with all cooked fish this time):-edamame-salad with japanese dressing-futomaki roll-caterpillar rollWhile I'm not rushing back, I don't think Kyoto is going anywhere, so I imagine I'll be returning eventually.  Remember, it's A-OK as long as you don't have high expectations.  Enjoy!
Drift Lounge="Where should we go now?""I think Drift is nearby...have you guys ever been there?""No...where is it?"Let me look it up on my phone....it says its less than a mile away..."***5 minutes later...***"Um, where are we?  This looks pretty residential....are you sure this place exists?""The GPS says to make a left, let's just keep walking...""Are those....are those Tiki Torches?""They are!  Thank you technology!" If you didn't know where it was, there is no way you would know it existed.  I stopped in with Bonnie G, Erica O., and the Poop Guy after SMoCA and I really enjoyed myself.  We had a great little booth in the corner, ordered some very strong and interesting drinks that came in fun glasses, ate some yummy vegetable spring rolls, watched a drunk douchebag hit on the hostess (she's the hostess, she can't get away!), and talked about our television habits when we were 11.  The makings of a good night indeed.The kitsch factor is high, which is good because I love me some kitsch.  Dare I say, its also surprisingly almost authentic touristy Hawaiian.   Our waitress was friendly and checked on us often and the food came out super quick.  I didn't think that the DJ was that intrusive.  It was good people watching (not as good as other places in Scottsdale) yet surprisingly laid back.  I will say that they really should add Don Q to their "Exotic Rums" list.  That would have garnered them a 5 star review from me for sure.Drift can be hit or miss as far as the crowd goes, but I always have a good time.  I have been to Drift more times than I can count.  It's always the fallback place if my friends and I are not not sure what to do or if we are not feeling it somewhere else. Things I've been asked at Drift:-Man grabs my arm as I am walking by (not the best pick-up technique to begin with- randomly grabbing girls).  Grabber- "Hey, you like Grey Goose?"Me- "Um, yeah."Grabber- "Good, cause I wanna get you loose."Me- "That is the worst line ever."Grabber- "Really, it didn't work."Me- "Nope, you might as well have asked if I'd like a pizza and a f*ck."-Guy grabs my arm and forces me to punch his friend. (Again, what is with all the grabbing?)Me to guy I just punched- "Your friend made me do it."Guy who forced me to punch his friend- "Don't worry, he deserved it." I won't go into the rest, but he proceeds to teach me a secret handshake before I can get away.  Then, later in the night when I run into him again, he forgets that he already met me and does the exact same thing to me all over again (hand shake and everything).  He thought I was a genius when I beat him to the punch and already knew the moves.Random guy corners me.R.G.- "Hey what's your name?"Me- "Morgan."R.G.- "My name's Ryan and this is my friend, Ryan."Me- "Really, you're both named Ryan?"R.G.- "Hey, two Ryans don't make a right."Me- silence.  A smirk slowly forming on my face because even though it was lame, it was a little creative.  R.G.- "I have a million dollar condo down the street, wanna go back and have a drink with us."Me- "I don't think so, you could be a serial killer."  Then, I paused because I realized his arm was in a cast.  "Oh, never mind.  You're injured, you can't kill anybody."My friend walks up, probably sensing he needs to save me- "What's going on?"Me- "He wants to have drinks in his million dollar condo, but I said no because he might be a serial killer.  Then, I realized I could kick his ass because he only has one good arm."My friend- "What happened to your arm?"R.G.- "It doesn't work."Me/my friend stare blanklyMe- "What do you mean it just doesn't work?"R.G.- "Remember the whole Firestone tire recall?  Well, I was in a rollover and that is why my arm doesn't work.  I got a really big settlement, so wanna go to my condo?"Me- I have no words.(And no, I didn't go to his damn condo)  Yep, I have found true love and his name is Drift.So, an update with another fun conversation from Drift.Standing at the bar waiting for my drink, I turn to see some guy smiling at me and tipping his drink in my direction as if to say hello.Me: "What are you drinking?"Guy: "Beer."Me: (duh) "What kind of beer?"Guy: "Budlight."Me: "Oh...well, that's pretty average."Guy: "What do you mean average?"Me: "I mean common, I guess."Guy's friend: "I'm drinking a Blue Moon."Me: "Oh, that's not bad."Guy: "Well, fuck. I'm not rich."Me: silent stare I probably should have said something snarky back to him, but I just slowly side stepped away while giving him the 'you are crazy' look. The guy tried to talk to me again later that night. I told his friend that he was mean and somehow that escalated to his friend doing some sort of weird hand hold thing with me every time he walked by. It was like his hand raped my hand in order to make me feel better about his friend being weird. I don't know, I was a little drunk and it seemed so comical that I just went along with it. I also have to add that it is pretty easy to grab a drink at the bar even when it's crowded.  I never have to use the trick where I pretend that I am about to throw up so that people will move aside. Ok, I've never actually had the guts to use that trick, but I am sure it would work.
Gus's New York Pizza=I can't be any clearer about this: This was the absolute worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life.I understand the average review before my writing is 4.5 stars, but I simply cannot conceive of this idea. Somehow, after the first rancid slice, I was able to continue through almost two more slices before my disgust overwhelmed my hunger. I don't care if I'm used to great pizza in Chicago, there has GOT to be something in between...So after getting a flier on my door for this place.... loaded with large print coupons for enormous amounts of food for next to nothing prices, I had to try it.I ordered a 18inch 2 topping pizza and 20 wings for $13.  Sounds great right?  Came out to $15 with tax.  I thought to myself, swell deal, better than any pizza place I've ordered from.When the guy came to the door he said it was $24.  I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.The pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.  I'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!!!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!Due to my downtown Tempe location I've been getting flyers from Gus's taped onto my door for years.  A couple nights ago, I had a wicked hunger smack me in the face around 1am, so I decided to give Gus's pizza a shot.Gus's flyers all scream about online ordering, so I wandered to their site and thought I'd give that a try.  I noticed right away that next to their $1.50 delivery charge was a 49 cent "service fee."  Being a poor college student, I decided to skip the fees and just call in for takeaway.  I call, speak to some almost-unintelligible knucklehead, and order my 18" pepperoni, sausage, and garlic using one of the many coupons that have collected on my desk.  Knucklehead says twenty minutes and I thank him, chuckle at amusing youtube videos for ten minutes, and then make the five minute drive to guarantee that my pizza will be fresh from the oven.I hit up Delhi Palace a couple times a month so I know the location, but I had never been inside Gus's before.  I was immediately unimpressed.  Behind the counter was some mid-forties guido complete with slicked back hair and gold chain around his neck, and a couple of other guys who appeared to be trying as hard as they could to avoid working.I tell them I'm here, and guido turns to chump number one, whose job it apparently was to make my pizza. It turns out he hadn't done so yet, so he tossed it together, threw it in the oven, and told me it'll be ready as soon as it's ready.  I pay (using cash to avoid yet another fee), sit down, and listen to the banter between the knuckleheads behind the counter and the disturbing douchebag at the table behind me, who apparently likes women much shorter than him that he can dominate.  Mothers, watch your daughters.  No, not the ones at ASU, the ones in junior high.  My pizza was finally done after about 15 minutes of angry birds, so I took it home and popped open the box.  The toppings all appeared to be right, but the smell was off.  Who knows, maybe they use the magical ingredient that makes their pizza as good as all of the one-review five-star sockpuppets who have reviewed Gus's say it is, but no.  Instead, I'm eating bland crust, oversweet sauce, and some form of dried chunks of garlic rather than the fresh garlic I was expecting between my meh pepperoni and tombstone-quality sausage.It's important to try many things in life, but now that I've tried Gus's pizza I can safely say I'll never be back.  I don't care how drunk or hungry I may be, and how late it has gotten, Gus's is off the list.This place is disgustingly gross. Its so gross, its almost disrespectful, do they seriously expect people to eat this? Well, I guess they do expect dumb people to eat this, and the only people who are dumb enough to eat this I guess are the loads of ASU students in the area. Oh wait, it makes sense now, they are still in business because drunk ASU kids eat food from one of the few places that is open 24/7.Do not get chicken as a pizza topping, its breaded chicken. Pizza dough was gross, soggy, not done well. The sauce was super watery and tasted bad as well. We ordered garlic knots, and well, the same thing here. In fact, the garlic knots had no garlic, there was just some garlic sauce on the side and some marinara (tasted like crap). I think I had the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. I think frozen pizza tastes 10x better.Gus's is disGUSting. I think if you wanted to make pizza at home you'd do a much better job even if you can't make microwave popcorn.The people who run this place are straight up criminals. I grew up on the east coast, and I was pretty swasted one night and had their pizza at a friend's place and it reminded me of the NY style pizza back home. I tried them sober and while the STYLE is there, the flavor is not. If you want pizza with the aftertaste of a bucket full of bloody vomit, eat at Gus's. If you want cheese with questionable expiry, eat at Gus's. If you want stale crust, eat at Gus's. If you want the folks who make the Jersey Shore cast look like British Nobility at the counter to treat you like complete garbage while you're in the storefront itself, eat at Gus's. The last time I got pizza delivered from them, it took them the better part of 2 hours to get the COLD pizza to my doorstep a mile and a half away on a thursday night. When I got there, I tipped the driver generously anyway, even though he was clearly baked out of his gourd and the pizza was nearly destroyed(seriously, did he drive through a destruction derby on the way? is that why the pizza took so long?). I paid over the phone with a card and tipped with cash. He took it upon himself to tip himself AGAIN on the signed receipt line. So I ended up paying almost 40 dollars for their smallest pizza with all the surcharges and double tip. When I called to talk to a manager, I was told that there was "nothing they could do to refund the money" but that he would talk to the driver and let him know that "wasn't cool". Yeah. No. Straight up theft and credit card fraud ISN'T cool. I told the guy on the phone(who knows if it was actually a manager) that his response wasn't even remotely appropriate and that I would be calling my credit card company to do a chargeback. He back pedaled and told me to come into the store and he'd give me both tips back in cash. I told him to do something lascivious with whatever hellbeast gave birth to him.So should you eat at Gus's? Only if you don't value your time, money, health, dignity, or temper. You'd be much better off getting some pizza from Slices on Mill. Or Native New Yorker. Or NYPD. They all have the good New York style without all the garbage slathered on top. And for far cheaper.
Nora's Italian Cuisine=Whenever I'm headed out to lunch with coworkers/vendors, and people are in the mood for Italian, two places come up as suggestions: Pasta Mia and Nora's.  I've been to Pasta Mia quite a few times and well...whenever these decisions come up I'm always rooting for Nora's.Now maybe it's because I grew up going to places like Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill, but for the most part I've never "craved" Italian food for the better part of my life.  Nothing against those two restaurant chains, I've had good family celebrations there, but the food never hooked me.  Well, my opinion of Italian is slowly changing after visiting Nora's repeatedly.I started out with fettuccine, spaghetti, etc. and all those other dishes that most places serve.  What really won me over was their Melrose Pesto.  I've had pesto before at other places, and there were times were I was gagging it down.  I'd given up on the green sauce, until a coworker brought back leftovers of their Melrose Pesto at Nora's.  I ate it the next day for lunch, and immediately knew that I had to try that on my next visit.  I was able to do just that this week, and here I am anxiously waiting for my next meal there.Also of note is the skill of the bartenders.  They make some well crafted cocktails, and outside of Downtown Cocktail Room, this is the only other place that I trust to make me an Old Fashioned.  Nora's makes it to my list of repeat eats.I've been here on quite a few occasions and I have to say that I've never been entirely enthralled by this place. The food is just ok, nothing amazing. The pasta is generic and not particularly flavorful. A little on the overpriced side as well. I enjoy the garlic bread, which is pretty good. I have had some very good baked ziti, so that's been the saving grace here. The service is ok, but I get irked at having to wait for a table here. There's always a long wait. There are better Italian restaurants in town and there are worse.* * * * *  Review # 250  * * * * *I had an eye opener within the past 24 hours.  I had heard really good things about Nora's from several different sources, and finally ventured out with Diane and another couple to find out for myself.  What I discovered was one of the finest and most consistent Italian restaurants I have had the pleasure of experiencing anywhere. Very good buttery and complimentary Garlic Bread?  Check!  A well-seasoned and very tasty, lightly floured Gamberoni Fritti with succulent shrimp?  Check!  A hot and tasty, complex cup of Pasta Fagioli with Ditalini Pasta, tomato pieces, and an abundance of beans?  Check!A fine House Salad with small black olives, tomato quarters, a light Italian Dressing, a pepperoncini, and crunchy greens covered with a dense coat of cool Mozzarella Cheese coils?  Check!Large and thin, nicely pounded medallions of veal covered by mushroom slices and bathed in a hot and welcome sweet Marsala Sauce?  Check!A large bowl of steaming al dente Spaghetti, sweet Meat Sauce, & toothsome Mushrooms?  Check! A comfortable, dimly lit ambiance, with an aroma of pleasant Italian spices that greets one's nostrils as soon as the front door swings open?  Check!And, excellent, attentive service throughout dinner service?  Check!It was one of those meals where everything pretty much fell into place like clockwork, with wonderful course building upon wonderful course.The only speed bumps encountered this night were a small piece of lettuce head core found on my salad plate; the restaurant being all out of The Republic of Tea Ginger Peach Longevity Tea; and no available gelato except Cookies 'N Cream.  Small blips all!   I look forward to an early return engagement!Since I last reviewed Nora's two months ago, I have been here twice more, and each time it just gets better and better.  Wonderful food smells of pizza and other Italian delicacies strike one's nostrils as soon as the front door is opened; the friendly service has remained generally excellent regardless who I was served by; and the food has continued to be piping hot and always delicious.  I now realize that the Veal Parmigiana is as good and tender as the Veal Marsala; the Garlic Bread is consistently delectable (my group of 4 polished off 2 baskets); and the Chicken Soup is on the same high plane as the homemade Pasta Fagioli.On my latest foray I enjoyed Antipasto Salad, and could barely finish half of it.  I look forward to eating the remainder later at lunch today.  Topped by chunks of fresh Mozzarella Cheese, folded over curls of tasty ham mixed with leafy greens, ripe wedges of red tomato, black olives, pepperoncini, and more, all coated with a dripping light Italian Dressing, beckon.The Chicken Soup, which I was smart enough to order as a bowl rather than a cup, contained thin lengths of chicken just as I preferred, mixed with cooked celery and pieces of tomato, swimming in a hot, very tasty chicken broth.  It took many tablespoonfuls for me to finish it all, and almost ruined my appetite.  But not quite!With considerable effort I also finished off a large cheesy and tomato sauce-covered medallion of Veal Parmigiana accompanied by smoking Spaghetti Bolognese with mushrooms added, as I had decreed.  Diane got a requested bowl of extra Alfredo Sauce to ladle over her Veal and Penne Alfredo at no extra charge.  Here one can have whatever the tummy desires!For good reason, Nora's will remain one of my several fine, go-to Italian restaurants in Vegas!I met friends from out of town for lunch earlier this week.  As always, Nora's did not disappoint!  There were 5 of us and we ordered a large salad that was enough to serve everyone at the table with seconds.  Ands, it was very good!I ordered one of their menu's "Lunch Favorites."  It was the penne chicken broccoli pasta with garlic and oil.  It was excellent.  One minus--there wasn't enough garlic taste for me.  One of the others at the table ordered a large pizza with pineapple and mushrooms--the pineapple being a first for me.  It was such a pity when there were three pieces of pizza left over and she couldn't take it home with her.  She was winging back to Canada the next morning.  I made the sacrifice and took one for the team.  I brought the three pieces home, had one for dinner, and have the other two frozen for a lunch treat!  Tip to Yelpers---go out to eat with out of town friends the day before they're flying home and you might get some take out for the rest of the week.I have been a fan of Nora's for several years and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking for good Italian food with a really good atmosphere and great service!Here's another Italian restaurant getting one of my few 5-stars. We three, finishing a trade show at the Mandalay, visited Nora's this past Saturday at 630p. It's a huge success with locals, and was jammed. Many locals were at the counter picking up "to go" orders. I made reservations earlier in the day, and we were quickly seated.Nora's was recommended to me by "The General", (Irwin Raymer), known from Animal Planet's hit "Tanked." Irwin came to our booth at the trade show, and after a short chat, we exchanged "deli and restaurant info", with me getting the better end of the deal. He recommended Weiss's for best NY Style  Deli, and Nora's for best overall Italian.Nora's is in the strip center, NE corner of Flamingo and Jones, West of the Rio hotel. You'll walk in the door, with the hostess station and kitchen straight ahead, the bar and one dining area on the right, and what I'd call the main-dining area on the left. We sat in the main dining area, against a wall in the NW corner. For three, and because I wanted to get "a flavor" of Nora's, we ordered with the intention of "sharing until we burst!" (actually, we didn't intend to over-do-it... but the food was so incredibly good, and huge portions!) We started with the Antipasto Salad Large, and Steak Bruschetta. For our entrees, we ordered the Crazy Alfredo, Frutti de Mar, Chicken Marsala Linguini, and Oso Bucco. Best description would be... hearty, enjoyable, flavors.  We also ordered indivdual glasses of wine and three desserts, which we also shared. The Cannoli, (the Sicilian pastry dessert, not to be confused with Cannelloni, the Italian large reed, cylindrical type of pasta generally served baked with a filling and covered by a sauce), was our favorite. The Tirimisu was very good, and the Cheesecake circle was good. But that's splitting hairs... as the whole meal was one winning item after another. Our server was Brice, and it was with his guidance, and my instruction that we wanted to "get a flavor of Nora's" that we feel expert now in working their menu. Over the years I've eaten at numerous strip restaurants in Vegas, but I much prefer the "off the strip" and privately owned restaurants, both for their more relaxed atmosphere, and their great food at reasonable prices. If Nora's were in a strip hotel, I'd venture to say they'd be giving every other restaurant a run for their money. It's that good! You gotta' add this to your black book of "off the strip" Italian spots..... It's a "No-Brainer"...........  "Botta-Bing-Botta-Boom!"After eating real Italian food when I went to Italy a few years ago, I became an Italian food snob.  Good Italian restaurants in Vegas? No such thing!  Until I came to Nora's.I got there before they even opened for the day and I'm glad I did as it got real busy around 11:30!  That's always a good sign.We got calamari which was tender and crisp.  I got gnocchi in Alfredo sauce which was creamy and absolutely fabulous.  We also got the rib eye sandwich with gorgonzola topped with onion strings and homemade potato chips on the side plus a basket of fries.  It had huge chunks of meat and the rich and tangy flavor of the gorgonzola complements the meat.  For everything we got, I only paid less than $40!The service was good.  Remember to check-in so you can get a free glass of wine.  The free garlic bread is great.  You can definitely taste the garlic which I love.I am writing this review as I enjoy leftovers from dinner earlier tonight. The Nora experience ...ahh where to start...From the moment you step into Nora's you feel right at home. The restaurant has this indescribable homey feel to it that just puts a person at ease. There are two rooms to the restaurant, without having made a reservation, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately in the room by the kitchen.Their ceiling is very unique and is decorated with Trinacria ornaments which is the symbol of Sicily. Our server was nice enough to give us a short history lesson...pretty interesting. The garlic bread...ahhh the garlic bread...I could probably eat three baskets myself. So thin, crispy, and buttery....ahh AND GARLICKY...so delicious. The first basket is free and every additional basket is 2.50...which is smart of them because it is just that addicting. I can see people going off on the garlic bread and call it a day. I ordered the Chicken Carciofi in attempts to be "healthy"....I figured that chicken breast can't be that bad for you...eh. The order is served with pasta, fresh tomatoes, artichokes, and capers. The chicken was so moist and the flavors were just MMmmmMm...perfect...not to salty and just right. Pretty much blown away at first bite. Very generous portions, which explains why I'm stuffing my face with pasta at 1:30am...Such a bad idea blaghhh...Body will hate me for eating all these carbs before bed.Friends got the rigatoni special and cheese raviolis which were great as well but I was pretty overwhelmed with my Carciofi to really enjoy theirs.We also got the calamari and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, but I wasn't really impressed with either.Really great Italian food at very reasonable prices without sacrificing service. Our server was very attentive and informative. I will definitely be back to try the crazy alfredo. It is probably a good idea to make a reservation next time to be seated in the main room.Guaranteed to put you in a food coma.I really hope that the hype behind this place is that it once was much better and people are latching on to the nostalgia. This was one of the most mediocre restaurants I have visited. We made reservations for 8:45pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. It is located in a small strip mall and would be easy to miss. We were promptly seated and that is when everything started to go downhill. It took ~15 minutes to even get acknowledged and place our drink order. Their gnocchi and pasta are not made in house. I am not sure what would compel someone to pay $12 for gnocchi out of a package when I can get delicious gnocchi from Trader Joe's and toss in some pancetta for $5. I opted for their Frutti di Mare ($21) which was linguini in runny arrabiata sauce with an assortment of seafood. The husband had their carbonara which ranks among the worst I have ever had in the states. I am not even comparing this to Italy standards. While two of the three members of the party were still eating, one of the people's plates got taken away to be boxed up. Awkward. The server ignored our table pretty much most of the time and then rushed us out at the end. I would not come back nor recommend this place. It is all hype.Finally.  After a good 6 years of knowing about this place, really ever since dining at the old/extinct location on Rampart/Charleston like 20 times, it was about time I came to the original.As I understand, they've expanded onto the original.  What used to be a pizza kitchen with 3 tables, went left, and went right, and now has 3 distinct rooms with 3 distinct different feels.  When reserving a table, make sure you specify.  The family room (quiet and better for families), the casual (still 3 tables, attached to the kitchen), and the ritzy (connected to the bar, very nice, and hip).  PS.  One little TV in the bar doesn't quite cut it.(1)  One free Sangria with Yelp check-in with 1 purchased.  A $7.50 value, giddy up.  Could be more fruity and less sharp.  (4.0 stars)(2)  Pasta alla Nora ($12.50) -- It has everything I wanted.  Pesto, meat sauce, eggplant, and pasta.  I added a meatball for $1.50, and it exactly fixed the spot.  Huge portion.  (4.0 stars)(3)  The Melrose with Shrimp ($17.50) -- a creamy pesto sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and medium-size shrimp.  A little heavy-handed with the sauce, but better than not enough.  (4.5 stars) The service was nice, but wavered between unavailable and forgetful.  Overall, this place just makes me happy.  It would totally be my everyday place if I was local.  For out-of-towners, if you are looking for an easy-peasy spot away from the strip, this is your place.Nora's Cuisine has been seen as Las Vegas's best kept secret since opening in 1991. I recently was let in on that secret when I was on West Flamingo with a strong craving for Italian Food. When I walked in I noticed the decor of dark cherry and textured paint on the walls. My first condo was decorated  similar so it felt very inviting. The limited seating also made for a cozy dining experience.We were brought some complimentary garlic bread almost immediately after being seated. The aroma from the bread was intoxicating but when I bit into the bread the grease was too heavy that I felt it on the roof of my mouth. I've had better garlic bread so I just moved on to the Caesar Salad. The Romaine lettuce was crisp and lightly coated with homemade dressing.  Honestly the croutons that topped the salad were much better than the bread and the Caesar dressing was perfect. I was torn between the Chicken and Veal Parmigiana so I asked the waiter his favorite out of the two. He said he preferred the Veal. When I can't decide sometimes I ask for the waiter's advice as a tie breaker but it doesn't always go so well . I'm happy to say this time the waiter knew what he was talking about! The veal was tender inside with crispy outer breading. It was served  over a tasty marinara sauce and topped with a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese. I also tested my husband's Baked Rigatoni which was made with a meat sauce, rigatoni, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. My impression at first bite was it was too salty. It tasted better the next day. On a sweeter note we had the Oreo Tartufo for dessert. It was a ball of cookies and cream ice cream covered with a hard chocolate shell. It was big enough to share and small enough where you wouldn't  feel sorry you ate it. It was sinfully delicious! Nora's is great place for date night or a family dinner. The portions are generous and the service is excellent!Great classic Italian cuisine!I used to work around the corner from this place and ordered out all the time because they had amazing spaghetti and a great lunch special and after a few years I ended up back here for a lunch meeting. Nothing has changed. The food was just as good as it always had been and the service is also always great.The one negative for me is the ambiance. It's a very plain looking place and there's not much to it. Once again this is a place I would love to makeover. The food is always key for me and service is next so I still highly recommend this place for classic Italian dishes. Some of my favorite items are the antipasto, chicken Milanese and spaghetti with meatballs.Las Vegas Review Part II of the "Losing Money, Spending Money and General Hubby Eating Freebies Back At Home Tour".Friday night in Vegas, it was my mom's choice for dinner and she is a Vegas local, so of course she didn't want to hit the strip, or have a buffet, or deal with the traffic and valet at the hotels.  Nora's Cuisine is a mid-size local Italian restaurant, that appears to be popular.  They had live entertainment, which I found to be ok, but definitely geared towards an older crowd (and hell I'm older now, and it was still too old for me!)  The portions are large but I found the prices to actually be on the high side.  Let me explain:  Italian food usually is larger portions and usually is on the cheaper side, excluding Northern  Region Italian and some pricier ingredients, think Marscapone Cheese, Veal and Fresh Seafood.  I ordered a fairly basic salad and spaghetti & meatballs, both really standard with basic and cheaper ingredients.  While both dishes were large, the salad was again, basic, could have used more mozzarella and other than a few olives, tomatoes and onion, was overpriced at $7.95.  Highlight of salad was the homemade ranch dressing which was delicious.  The spaghetti & meatballs was again large, but the 2 meatballs were more on the smaller to medium size and you were really left with quite a bit of pasta.  I did not detect any veal in the meatballs, and the seasoning/ingredients was not quite there, as they were not soft and tender and appeared to be missing the requisite amount of cheese.I found service to be lacking, I had to ask twice for a simple refill of iced tea and I also had to ask for parmesan cheese as a topping for my spaghetti & meatballs.  The waiter seemed stressed (too busy perhaps) but that's not exactly my problem, is it?  Side note:  My mother had made reservations, we were on time, but we still had to wait about 15 minutes.Overall I would recommend Nora's, but I don't know that I would make it a for sure Italian destination when I'm back in Vegas.Classy italian restaurant that'll knock your socks off.    Went on Sunday 12-20-15 at 6:30 with my yelpy friend Jamie P.  She was nice enough to make us reservations and the place was packed so I'm glad she did that! We had 4 adults and a baby in our party and the hostess threw a hissy fit because she said the reservation is for four....not five people...so we'll have to wait.  I was thinking can't we just pull up a high chair to the table?  The answer was no.  Ended up being seated about 7PM and no food on the table until about 7:40 but that's the *only* puny little complaint that I have.  $95.83 got us a small 4 Staggioni pizza, a margarita, a whiskey sidecar cocktail, an appetizer of clams, a house salad, a chocolate cake, two coffees, and a ginger ale.  The table and napkins are real white linen and the table is covered by white paper.  Crayola crayons were brought out for my boy which I thought was cool (none of that cheap-o Rose Art shit).  I originally wanted the Branzino but they were out :( *sad violin noises* The clams were hot and fresh and the menu says it comes with 12 but I swear there were at least 2 dozen in my bowl.  The menu says  "12 Manila Clams, Evo, Lemon Parsly" and I'm pretty sure that's not how you spell parsley and shouldn't it be "EVOO" if they are trying to say extra virgin olive oil?  Whatevs....it was $14.95 and the clams were hot and sweet and wonderful.  I only had one that was sandy but the rest were awesome.  The 4 Staggioni pizza had pizza sauce, sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, and olives.  The small was $15.45 and worth every penny.  I loved the puffy crust and I'm enjoying the leftovers today as we speak.  The chocolate cake must be ordered ahead of time (at the time you order your entrees) and was a steal for $6.50.  It is a rich, soft centered, Valrohna chocolate cake adorned by a vanilla sauce and pistachios.  Valrohna is a type of rich chocolate heavy on the cocoa side.  I absolutely loved this.  It's making my mouth water right now just thinking about it! With Olive Garden being the only other italian food I've experienced, this place blows it out of the water.  It would be a great place to take a date or family members that come here from out of town.  I liked it a lot!  And I liked the good company even more. *wink wink*
Ruby Tuesday=It'd been years since I'd been to a Ruby Tuesday's before last month. And since then I've been three or four times. Is it that good? No, not really. I mean, it's not bad, not as bad you probably think it is, anyway. But it ain't great. So why do I keep going back? That's a good question. Because it's not cheap, either. Probably because it's close to work.I've been making my way through their seafood options lately. The jumbo lump crab burger - it's crab cakes on a bun. That's probably some kind of no-no on somebody's lo-carb diet. Fried shrimp, grilled creole shrimp, shrimp scampi... tried 'em all, and they're all the same - not that good, but not bad. An incredibly solid three stars.Oh, and they've got a veggie burger, which technically pushes them up to 3.5 stars, but I'm not in the rounding up kind of mood today.
Santa Rosa Taco Shop=IT AIN'T PRETTY BUT THE TACOS ARE SOMETHING ELSEWe must have been their big catch of the day.  One lady is munching on her two 99 cents tacos with no sides, three ladies were talking in broken Spanish about the restaurant while ordering nothing from the counter and visiting the restroom. And here we are waiting for our Chicken Taco & Chicken Enchilada for $6.50 plus a Chili Verde Plate for $7.75. Not to forget two large fruit drinks. Just in front of us is one of the help asleep (looked like he was recovering from the morning rush of released inmates) in front of the TV with Clemson playing at Maryland. BTW, across the street is the Henderson Detention Center, but no cops in sight. Do you get the picture ?This is not a fancy Michoacan restaurant by any means. If you really want to know how sparse, even a Taco Bell seems fancier. Roberto's would the opposite extreme. So don't complain about the prison cell ambience. It's a place to pick up your cheap meal and eat behind your desk or at home. Wonder if the inmates across the street are thinking the same?  LoLLoved my pan fried chicken taco and enchilada. Chili verde plate was exaggeratedly much too tasty as Yu-go chauffeur finds out later. He's drinking water like he had been lost in a desert without water for three days and nights.SRTS has another location on the south side of Lake Mead Parkway on the way to the Lake. Looking forward to trying their Tuesday only Breakfast Burrito for $2.99. The 99 cent tacos are available everyday and so is their Ground Beef Burrito for just $2.50. With all the construction going on at the gigantic Cadence housing development, it should be an early Xmas for that other location.
Persian Room=Not sure why it took me so long to try Persian Room...I've been hearing about it and driving by it since my move to AZ almost four years ago.  And I like Persian food.  But for whatever reason, I didn't pop my Persian Room cherry until just the other night!My aunt was actually the one who chose to eat at Persian Room.  It was a Saturday night, and our party consisted of six - four ladies, me, and my brother.  We had some drinks and appetizers at home before we went, so we decided to order family style and share.  Wise decision...Luciano was our server and provided us with excellent service along with the rest of the staff.  We ordered a (#10) Persian Appetizer platter to start, and it was perfect for sharing... it had hummus, eggplant dip, grape leaves, and a yogurt cucumber dip too.  We used the warm fresh bread to scoop it all up along with the fresh onions and Persian spices that were on the table too.  This could've been a meal in itself, it was all so tasty!Next, we shared a #20 - Chicken Kebab plate, a #36 - Vegetarian Stew (which had okra and eggplant and tons of other veggies that I like), and a #28 - Sultani mixed meat platter.  We requested 1/2 rice and 1/2 greek salads with the platters.This was just enough food for our group, although everything was delicious that had we ordered more, we would've kept eating for sure... instead, Luciano brought us out a couple of desserts (baklava and Persian ice cream) to share.  Mmmmmm - both were pretty fantastic!Total bill for all of the above + three glasses of wine was just over $100... not so bad.  I enjoyed my meal and I'm sure I will not wait another few years to return.  As a matter of fact, I'd be game to return in the next few weeks.  Great place for a family style meal + quick and attentive service.  See you again soon, Luciano!3.75First visit in years!  I could've sworn I'd written a review, albeit a year or two *after* my very first visit with Mom and her ex- back when I still lived in Chandler ('04), or perhaps even before that, in Maricopa (horrors!).  I remembered that he, a carnivore at heart, had the #31 Sultani,  while Mom and I shared the # 19 Chicken shish.  We also shared a hummus app.  I vividly recall thinking Persian Room's pita bread stupefying, and I'm happy to report it still is!It was a hard decision to make- what to have for dinner, after seeing "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" last night (go see it!!), but I decided I'd wait until I could treat Mom out for sushi and to go to PR, instead.  I tried to stop by for takeout on Valentine's Day, but my last minute decision, made after a public speaking class and a whirlwind two-hour writing session at the college library, was foiled when I encountered a packed parking lot, so I headed home instead.  It was easy to find parking tonight, and it was nice to see takeout menus waiting by the first set of glass doors (there are two), where I could comfortably read the menu before going through the second set of doors and place my order at the cashier/host desk.  The friendly female host took my order of Kashk O' Bademjan (app) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ#A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ and #33 Naderi (from the section of beef entrees) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA#GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA.  Note that "all entrees include basmati rice, pita bread, and a grilled tomato."  I asked how long the order would take to prepare ("about ten minutes") and proceeded up the stairs to the lounge to read my book as I wait.  Or so I thought...It was my first time up at the lounge, and it's cozy enough.  There are many two-top tables up there, in case you don't want to sit in the larger rooms downstairs, and the bar is comfortable enough to dine solo, or with a friend or two.  There is a TV for those who MUST watch sports as you dine with your companion or unfortunate date... As I've said, I was only going for takeout and was only up here to take advantage of the lighting, but silly me, I asked if PR offered happy hour, and sure enough, it does!  Monday to Friday, from 5p to 8p, happy hour discounts on beer and house wine ($4 glass instead of regular $6) AND a free app (hummus, hummus and eggplant, dolmeh, or yogurt and cucumber dip).  And so, I decided why not enjoy a glass of chard with the hummus I had passed on for dinner?  The pour was actually quite good, and tasty, and it paired nicely with the delicious sauce plate of hummus and a lone olive, topped with spices.  Hot pita bread followed shortly... I was blissful!  (Well, OK, I was very happy.  Yes, I was blissful, too, but that praise rightfully belongs to my lovely therapist at SWIHA!)The takeout took a lot longer than ten minutes, but I wasn't going to argue, not when I was already full from my app and tipsy from the wine!I hope to return more often!p.s.  I did get to try a few pieces of chicken and filet mignon (delicately marinated, yet flavorful, and so tender!), with saffron rice (so buttery!), and another large piece of pita bread to enjoy a bit of the eggplant app with.  The entree was delicious, yet I don't think it's worth $21.95 for take out (see photo).  I could see paying that while dining in, since I have to factor in service and atmosphere, but for takeout...?Ghaza aali bood, merci!p.p.s.  Struck me a bit odd that I saw a lot of Asians, instead of Persians, entering and exiting the restaurant.  A bit surreal, I thought, but it could've been the chardonnay... :)You definitely won't go hungry here!! The atmosphere was nice. The people were even nicer. It can be casual but you might want to put on something a little more special to dine here, plus it makes you feel good to dress up. The food was outstanding! The value to portion ratio at dinner is insane, I suggest fasting before eating here. You will get two large meals out of it. I was so hoping to try dessert after Yelps recommendations but I will have to control myself next time to fit that in. The bread is delivered to your table shortly after coming out of the oven & is warm & delicious. There were a few large groups that had laughter oozing from the tables which made it a fun experience. We can't wait to go again!I don't know why I don't come here more often.  They have a pretty good deal for happy hour.  Our last visit was for our International Super Club night.  I ended up coveting the dishes around me.  My hubby had the fesenjan, and it was really good.  He called it a persian mole.  Monica had a grilled chicken dish that looked delicious.  The tahdig was so yummy with all the hummus and baba ganoush.  I think their happy hour is until 8p.m. and they offer specials upstair on their drinks and appetizers.  I guess I need to make another trip to the Persian Room very soon.The Persian Room was the place picked for April's International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) and I have to say this place was amazing! After checking in with the hostess we were shown to our table, which was upstairs next to the bar, we were a party of 16 and we didn't take up all the room. Pretty nice sized place, plus when checking in the party before us was also another huge party of 13, so the Persian Room for sure can handle larger dinner parties, if looking for a place to take a group.Service is impeccable, Sultan and our servers took care of our table, every need was met, every drink refilled, you can tell they take pride in service here.1st brought out to the table was small plates with half an white onion sliced, fresh mint, basil , butter on it  and bread (pita) and I can honestly tell you, it was amazing, everything blended well together, and since I wasn't kissing anyone that night bring on the onions I say haha. Everything on the menu looks heavenly but for this trip I went with the Chicken Shish, thick chunks of marinated chicken breast grilled with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes and basmati rice.   The chicken was grilled perfectly, it was tender, juicy and full of flavor added with the peppers & onions and grilled tomatoes, this was outstanding, I ate it all! It was soo good!  But fair warning, portions are huge.   I truly enjoyed the company of everyone, the food and the service,  I have to say personally this was one of my favorite ISCUYE's to date, and will be coming back often to try everything on the menu.April 2014 International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) met here for dinner.  This was the anniversary of Monica O and I organizing the Yelp PHX International Supper Club and I'm so happy that we come here.  AFter a couple  of minutes, we were greeted at the front door and seated at an upstairs table - conveniently located next to the bar.  Kudos to the Persian Room for being THE restaurant with the BEST and most ATTENTIVE service in the 13 months that our group has been meeting.  We usually have from about 15- 30 people to attend.  IN this case, we were some place in the middle.  A large group that was waited on by 3 very attentive people.  I liked this - A LOT.  3 people helped to make things go more smoothly and efficiently. I can't say enough about how happy I was with the quality of their service.  In addition to our large party, there was another large birthday party in the downstairs dining room that was being seated at the time that we were being seated.  This is an awesome place for a large party.Their happy hour lasts until about 7 or 7:30(Insanely late), so I am pretty sure that most of us ordered more than expected because all of their appetizers are half price during the happy hour.  I ordered a very delicious Chicken eggplant borani as my appetizer and shared it with the table.  Several others ordered appetizers and shared too.  My favorite was the Yogurt and Garlic Dip.  YIKES.  That stuff was great.  Becca H ordered that and she was sitting right beside me.  I felt like a little kid sneaking someone's food.  I just kept dipping in her Yogurt/Garlic Dip.  (LOL - TWSS).I ordered a small side salad for my main course since the Chicken Eggplant Borani was enough to feed an army.  The side salad was just fine.  This also happened to be 2nd least expensive #ISCUYE!  I was happy with that.My return factor for this place is 90%.When I think of delicious and filling comfort food, Persian Room is one of the first places that comes to mind. I have eaten here many times over the years and the experience has never been anything but exceptional. It's not cheap but not overall expensive and the portions served are enough for multiple meals.I have had many different dishes but. A few of my favorites are:1. The hummus and eggplant appetizer served withy their fresh made delicious flag bread.2. Beef koobideh. My wife loves the chicken but I prefer the beef. It's a long piece of seasoned ground beef. Sounds boring but is absolutely amazing. I actually like it more then the filet skewer. Totally savory and mouth watering.3. The chicken barg. Simple dish but they manage to make chicken breast juicy, flavorful, and perfect. I don't often order chicken at restaurants but I crave this stuff.The nice part about this place is you can order combos of pretty much anything. Again, the portions are huge so we always end up having leftovers. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it...
Del Yaqui=so today my coworker trace was looking for a place to get lunch, carne asada was on the request. i quickly jumped on Yelp did a search for Carne Asada in our work zip code and low and behold El Yaqui came up and it was pretty close and had a glowing review from Angelo C. it was confirmed that this place is not on the street, but instead inside a market place. the carne asada burrito is delicious, grilled and chopped meat, seasoned right, with grilled onions and beans. wrapped up in foil to keep it warm with a side of lime and pickled carrots and a salsa. from what i can tell from the beans in the burrito, they are awesome. lardy and smooth just the way they should be. 1 million calories later... I'm in carne asada coma now. if your in the area, or work around here. check this place out...
Tasty Island Jamaican Restaurant=Never having Carribean or Jamaican food before, I was interested when a coworker mentioned that he went to this place and enjoyed it. I went today with him and a few others to give this place a shot, and we were all quite surprised.  I didn't really expect it to be so good.  I ordered the Goat Curry with Jamaican Roti, and the Sweet Potato Pudding for dessert.  I have yet to have a goat curry that I have really liked.  The dish in general always seems to be served with a sweet yellow Indian curry, which I'm not a huge fan of.  This curry was different.  I loved it.  It wasn't sweet at all, nor made with coconut.  It had a perfect spicy flavor without going over the top.  There were little potatoes in it, along with very tender and moist stringy goat meat.  The roti was amazing... very flat, floury bread with a little bit of spice cooked into it, perhaps from a curry.  I dipped it in my curry sauce, and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  There was also a little coli flower salad that came with the dish, and a whole wheat bun.  The Sweet Potato Pudding caught me off guard.  I didn't really taste a lot of sweet potato in it, but did taste perhaps a little rum or something like that.  It had raisins in it too, and was more of a little pudding cake.  It was quite enjoyable, but after all of the food that we had, i just couldn't finish it!  We also had some of the beef and chicken stuffed patties.  You HAVE to try the beef patties.  They are spicy with shredded beef stuffed inside a layered pastry.  Just deliciousness.  When I come back, and I definitely am, there is simply no way I could not order one of these on the side.Personally, I think the reviews on this place are low.  The ambiance isn't much; it fees like a mom and pop diner.  The staff offers adequate service, but isn't overly friendly.  The place is just very casual.  However, I think the food is quite a bit above average.  The prices are slightly high, but if that bothers you just drink a water and don't order any extras.  The food is worth it.  I don't really like sweet Indian curry, so this curry has me hooked!  I can't wait to try the ox tail!I'm part Jamaican, didn't ya know?  Well, not really, but my best friend since the 7th grade is Jamaican-American and her house was practically my second home growing up.  Her huge family is like my family and I've traveled to Jamaica with them three times, so I do know a little about the food.  Guess where my second family likes to eat when they're in Vegas?  Yeah, mon, Tasty Island, so you know it has to be good.  My girl was in town with some of her clan this past weekend and they wanted to have lunch here so we did.  I always get the oxtail with rice and peas and a slice of plaintain, washing it down with Kola Champagne (best soda ever)--oh yeah!  I had a beef patty as an appetizer and that thing had a slight kick-it was fresh out of the oven and it was a little spicy hot for me.  I can't do the jerk chicken because I'm too wimpy for the spicy, but my son had it and he ate it up (he's also almost Jamaican by default).  He usually gets the curry chicken, but they were out.  Service here can be on the slow side while you wait for your food, but that's why you should have a patty in the mean time: they have beef, chicken, and veggie patties, which are pastries with your choice of filling.  Some dishes are served with festival, Jamaican dumplings, and I tried my friend's, but it was kind of dry.  Other than that, we had another great meal here.  Everyting irie at Tasty island, mon!There's nothing like homestyle Jamaican cooking! I don't think there's a lot of Caribbean food places in town, so it was cool seeing this place in a shopping center near my house while doing errands. The service was more on the slow side, but I think that the wait was worth it. The people working here were really friendly, too!The interior was a little dated. There are tables and booths, but it didn't really have a set layout. When I arrived there was no music playing, the TV wasn't on, and the patrons dining in were super quiet. The silence was a little unbearable and kinda made the experience a little more awkward (especially with people lining up behind me). Thankfully, a younger gentleman, who I'm assuming worked there too, turned on the TV so that the room wasn't filled with the uncomfortable silence and the steady hum of the refrigerators. I ordered the the small size jerk chicken and a side order of plantains. The jerk chicken was pretty great! From what I remember, if you don't cook jerk chicken the correct way it gets rubbery and hard -- borderline inedible. The jerk chicken here was tender and juicy, with a nice chew to it.  The seasoning had the perfect spicy kick, which was enough to make me sweat a little. (Keep in mind that my tolerance for spice is a little lower than everyone else's, but that's what makes Caribbean food desirable -- the spices!)The rice and peas (beans) is the best thing to go with the jerk chicken. It also had a good Caribbean spice to it, so it will really give you a mouthful of unique  flavors if eaten with the chicken. Yummy!The plantains weren't like the plantains I'm usually used to eating. These were more like long, slender slices of ripe plantain fried to golden brown perfection. They had the perfect texture and they're on point with the sweet, caramelized homemade flavor.I didn't really like the beef patties here. I think there are other better tasting ones out there but until I find a good place in Vegas, this place will have to suffice. The food here definitely has a personality of its own. If you're a spice fanatic and are down to taste the flavors of Jamaica, then give this place a try!
New Asian Kitchen=I don't know if this place change ownership, or if some of these yahoos have selected the wrong location for the review. this is one of the best small and independent fast food chinese food restaurants in Phoenix.  I and my family and friends are regulars. it is ridiculous that some people believe that they are able to assess a place in a single visit just because it wasn't perfect.they are friendly, the food and vegetables are fresh and hot, and the prices are great. want-to-be food critics need to realize that no restaurant or magazine or television food critic evaluates a place good or bad in only one visit. this is a five star place for the type of restaurant it is.. I encourage anyone who has only had one visit, especially if it was two or more years ago, to either revisit or I hope that the intelligence of the reader is able to discern the difference. I love new Asia kitchen
Fujiya Market=Each Saturday, there's a limited serving of Japanese noodles from ramen to udon to whatever. It's fresh and authentic. I have eaten ramen all over Japan, SoCal, NorCal and throughout the world. Trust me on this!So this place is not a restaurant, by the way. It's actually a small grocery market that they set up some plastic chairs and tables in the corner of the store. You can actually buy bento boxes or other food items or drinks and sit down to enjoy it. It's a local Japanese grocery store!Ok, but back to the ramen/udon. Each week, you can check on their facebook page for the noodle bowl of the week. You come in and order and there's really small staff in the back preparing your food. Everyone in there is Japanese and speaks Japanese. I actually sat with these two old Japanese ladies that came in for ramen and we talked about Japan and AZ when they first got here in the 1960s. That was awesome.Like I said before, it gets pretty packed and they run out of noodles usually in an hour. Come early and eat the delicious food. You can walk over to the freezer and buy yourself a Japanese drink too. Afterwards, you can go next door to the Japanese bakery and get dessert.There's really no other place like this in the Phoenix area so come try it out.
Jim's Coney Island Cafe=What a gem of a diner.  It's a total throwback and the people working here make you feel right at home.  I bet it's easy to become a regular after just one visit.  The menu is so diverse and full of everything you could want from a diner.  I tried the Coney Island Dog because I'm the only one I know who's actually heard of coney dogs and I so miss them.  It was pretty good, but how could you possibly mess up a hot dog of any kind?  My friend had some green chili omelet thing and a side of biscuits and gravy.  Mmmmm, some seriously good diner food!The best part was our waitress.  She ended up reading our astrological birth charts right there at the table, just for fun.  She had the kinda personality that makes diners like this special.  If you're in the area and want a laid back, no BS kinda place to grab a bite, try Jim's Coney Island.  I only wish they were open later because this would be a great late night spot!Do you like it when you sit at the counter in a diner and the waitress calls you "Hon"..."Sweetie"..."Darlin' "? I know...I do too! It makes me feel like I've stepped back in time, to some mis-remembered past that probably never really happened to me (I may have watched too much TV many years ago...in fact when I walk into Jim's Coney Island, it seems to be in black and white, to me:) After my workout today, I was looking for a good place to retox:) I hadn't been to Jim's in quite a while, and this seemed to be a good time to get back to the lunch counter at Jim's:) Jim's throws the love at you...in any other hands this stuff is just regular diner fare...you know, the blue plate specials...the patty melts...the ham and cheese sandwiches...the clam chowder from the big white one gallon can...the frozen chicken fried steaks...you know, just good, solid diner food:) But, when they call me "cutie" as they serve my coney island and fries, it just makes everything...better:) What can I tell you...I'm a sucker for flattery:) That's not to say that Jim's serves crappy food and makes up for it with flattery...in fact it's all very tasty (including the actual coney island hot dog...not chili dog...coney island hot dog:)...but it's not really special food. So, what is special about Jim's? It's the atmosphere, ambiance, the nice people, the varied and eclectic menu and specials (Liver & Onions, Greek Feta Salad and Bacon/Avocado Omelet, all juxtaposed on the specials menu today, along with the normal 100+ items on the regular menu:) About the only thing I would add to Jim's, would be homemade pie...a lunch counter like this needs 4-5 great pies, so I would have a place to go and have a cup of coffee and a piece of banana cream pie...but that's a quibble, not a criticism:) Jim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch, next to Hugh Beaumont, and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch, served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me "good lookin":) Even if it never happened, that's how I remember it, Hon:)My first meal at Jim's was over four years ago... i went to lunch with my friend Tom. It was love at first sight... (not with me and Tom; with me and Jim's!)  Jim's reminded me of the old school diner types of Coney Island restaurants I grew up going to in Michigan.  I had a tasty Greek Salad, warm pita bread, great service, and while Tom picked up the bill, I remember the prices being moderate.  All that and it took me approximately four years to return.But I finally made it back to Jim's today... and it was just as good, if not better, than I remembered!  As a matter of fact, I may just add Jim's to my rotation for favorite lunch (and breakfast) spots in town!Here's why:*Excellent service! Della was our waitress and she was awesome... she was patient with our party of four, she joked around with us, got our orders right, kept our drinks filled, and had an amazing looking green studded belt on to boot!*Excellent food with lots of choices! You want breakfast food? They've got it!  You want salad? There are several choices! Gyros - sure thing... and if you get a sandwich, you get your choice of sides including cottage cheese, french fries, apple sauce, tomatoes, and more!*Moderate prices and large portions!*Old school decor!*Comfy booths!Thanks for sharing a fun lunch with me today, Brandon, Blair, and Lindsey... and glad I beat you to reviewing Jim's!  Let's do it again soon!
Lo Cascio's Italian Restaurant=First visit 3 stars, second visit 2 stars unfortunately.  I don't doubt the pasta is still A-OK, but I have to knock them down for their entree-sized salads.  I ordered a Caesar with chicken.  The addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to $12.95.  While plentiful, the romaine was so drenched in dressing, the crispness of the lettuce was lost.  The chicken was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.  A shame because the dressing was pretty good.My husband ordered the Antipasto per Due.  With back olives, artichokes, ham, salami, provolone, and anchovies, it should have been a hit.  But again, drenched in vinaigrette.  Also the meats and cheese were just thin slices, nothing of exceptional quality.  At $14.95, this was a miss.We also ordered bruschetta, but I had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed "sub rolls."  Better bread is a must.  While I might consider Lo Cascio again, I'll stick with pasta.  If you see me carry a duffel bag inside, I brought my own baguette, too.A Tale of Two Pizzas in Scottsdale, Part II. . .. . .well, this is in north Tempe, but close enough.Grrr.I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, where you can find good Italian restaurants all over the place.  I'm also Italian in heritage.  I have been eating and cooking Italian food for much of my life, and I know what it's like to mix ingredients in the right proportions to make a pasta sauce that needs at least five hours simmering time to taste just right.  I had passed Lo Cascio's many times on my way out of Scottsdale back to Tempe, and looked at the building with some anticipation--it looked a lot like some of the old Italian places that I grew up near.Recently, I finally took my family out to eat at this place.  Upon walking in, I noted the distinctive decor on the walls that told me that this place specialized in Sicilian cuisine, and I was looking forward to that characteristic taste.  I ordered a pizza, remembering the taste of the very thin and incredible pie served to my father and I in Naples a decade ago.  I'm aware that Naples isn't in Sicily, but I was looking forward to real Southern Italian character to my dinner that night.  My wife ordered an eggplant parmesan, and my daughter opted for a simple cheese ravioli.I was aware that my pizza was likely not going to have the same depth of flavor as the astounding one that I ate in Italy, but I was expecting something authentic and delicious.  What I got served to me was a f*cking frozen pizza--not even a name brand like DiGiorno's or Tombstone, but something on the level of the cheap, bargain frozen pizza that you find on the bottom shelf of the supermarket freezer.  You know, the one that's 2 for $7?  It was putrid.  Now, I have to admit that I have no proof that the pizza I got served was frozen, but I've had enough cheap pizza to know that bland, cardboardy taste.  Totino's tasted better for over $12 less.I ordered a salad too--$5 for a handful of iceberg lettuce with two hunks of tomato and two god-damned olives.My wife's eggplant parmesan was nothing special,  She ordered mixed vegetables with it.  Fresh?  Nope--Bird's Eye.My daughter got served what I refer to as the "Italian Scam"--seven cheese ravioli in low-quality tomato sauce for $15.  Many Italian restaurants pull the Scam on you, because most of us are gullible enough to buy the bullsh*t that a plate full of noodles and sauce should be expensive because it's "I-TALYAN."  This just topped off a bad experience for us.Good parts?  The bread wasn't "authentic", but was yummy and loaded with sesame seeds.  Service was fantastic, but that wasn't enough to save this place.This place was an insult to Italian cooking in general, let alone Sicilian.  I don't care how many maps of Sicily they have around or how many triskelion heads they put on the walls and the menu, this joint ain't "Sicilian" in any meaningful sense of the word.  Lo Cascio's made this second-generation Italian-American very angry.  There are good pasta places around the Valley, but I would avoid this spot at all cost.I just received a "compliment" tonight under the "You're Funny" heading from an individual named Leonardo M. concerning my review for this restaurant.  The "compliment" stated in whole:"I guess your review was meant to be funny. Frozen pizza and Birdseye frozen vegetables? Iceberg lettuce?Italian from San Francisco? You may have been in Olive Garden or better yet Buca di Beppo. My mother is from Naples and my father from Sicily. We've spent time in both places. Maybe Italian food in SF has been too Americanized over the years. Sorry you had a bad experience?"This Leonardo character has no reviews, no Yelp friends, and just started on Yelp this last September (2013).  A person with such stats wouldn't have any business or interest making a comment like that to me unless he was the owner, so I'm going to address this "compliment" to me as if I came from the owner.So, no Leonardo, I wasn't trying to be funny.  Yes, I got a warmed-up frozen pizza for my entree and a tiny salad composed of iceberg lettuce for an additional $5.  My wife's mediocre meal had tasteless frozen vegetables on the side.  That's not funny.You know what the sad thing is?  You didn't even try to make it better.  My family and I get one of the worst Italian meals of our lives, and all you felt motivated to do was insult me and my taste in food.I grew up on restaurants like Westlake Joe's in Daly City, Bertolucci's in South San Francisco, Banchero's in Hayward, and a host of incredible Italian cooking from the North Beach area of San Francisco itself.  If you went to the owners of these restaurants and told them that their food was "too Americanized compared to yours", you would either end up with a spiffy pair of cement shoes, or at least with a horse's head on your pillow next to you the morning.  Okay, NOW I'm trying to be funny.If this was just an off night, and you wanted to show me how good your food really was, you could have seriously apologized to me.  You could have invited my family back, served us up a wonderful meal, and I would have been back here on Yelp telling everyone to never mind about the previous bad review.  I would have been HAPPY to do that.But no, you decided to insult me instead.  That's a shame--far more of a shame than just serving me a bad dinner.  All I can say now is that it appears that bad taste goes far deeper in this restaurant than just the food.UPDATE 1/30/14:The morning after I put up this review update, I received two more "compliments".  The first was by a man named "Robert K." from Chandler, someone who has no Yelp friends and about 40 reviews, who thought enough about what I wrote above to call me a "butt-hurt little child" at 6:27 am.  A response from Leonardo came about an hour later (and his name mysteriously changed to "Leonard").  He claimed that he wasn't the owner--just a "patron for several years" who never had that kind of experience at Lo Cascio's.  I won't buy that story any more than I'll buy food at this restaurant again.UPDATE 12/6/14:By this point, I have received a total of  five messages, "compliments", and even a counter-review, all negatively responding to this review and its previous incarnation.  Apparently back in September of 2013, another reviewer named "Denton S." from Tempe wrote a review for this restaurant where he called me a "condescending jerk", reacting with outrage because I had the temerity to call the bread "not authentic."  Again, another sock puppet Yelp account--one review and no other Yelp activity.  Thankfully, the review went straight into the "not recommended" section.  Another communication I got even seemed to imply that I had some kind of deep-seated anger issue, and with a "namaste", tried to tell me that my bad review was somehow harmful to my emotional and spiritual well-being.Phew!  Look guy, I don't give bad reviews because I'm mean at heart--I give them because a business gives me bad service or a bad deal for my money.  You gave me and my family a sucky meal for $60+ bill, and for the past couple of years, you and/or some friends of yours have been finding ways on Yelp of insulting or belittling me because I gave your business a one-star review in return.If my negative review were the only one, it wouldn't mean much.  However, my bad review Is one of a number of them from some quite upset people who disliked your food, your service, or both.  That's not my fault--it's yours.  Bad reviews are feedback telling you what you are doing WRONG.  It's supposed to tell you where  and how you can IMPROVE what you are doing.  Instead of doing that, you send me multiple messages calling me a jerk and a tool.  You sent it to me, and now I'm posting about it here for all to see.  Hope it's been worth it to you.
Carlsbad Tavern=Yum, Yum, Yum.It's spicy, so wussies take note. I LOVE their blue corn enchiladas.... they're served on a big plate and all the sides run together and you can't tell what is what... MMM!Their chicken enchiladas are also top notch.Yum.Highly recommended, especially for those with taste buds of steel :)The type of cuisine at Carlsbad is officially considered 'Green Hash Chile New Mexican Style.'  I know this because we asked the bartender as we sat pondering the menu.  This was my first visit to Carlsbad Tavern, and it will not be my last.I went with a house salad and will agree with Rick S in recommending it with their jalapeno ranch dressing.  Either it was really good or I was really hungry, but I digress!  For my entree, the lobster enchiladas were completely satisfying - especially once they brought out a side of guacamole per my request.  Jared had the carne adovada plate.  (I guess he gets that every f-in time he goes there; i don't think he's ever had anything else!  Guess he likes it!)  No desserts or drinks this visit, but I'm sure we'll be back for more... although the mints on the way out were great!  (And for those curious about the price, our bill was $36 before tip).We noticed they serve a Sunday Brunch - Bloody Mary Bar as well... sounds good to me; especially once we move to Old Town and won't have to worry about drinking and driving!Friendly attentive service at the bar, and many more menu items I am excited to try.  Until next visit, Carlsbad Tavern...Carlsbat Cavern, or rather, Carlsbad Tavern, is a campy New Mexcian restaurant/bar that was the "ethnic" concession made to me by my parents after pleading to go to at least one regionally appropriate restaurant during my visit.What do I mean by campy, you ask?- Stuffed animal bats on the ceiling. As G.O.B. from AD would say, "Come on!"- Newspaper menus headlined "The Daily Guano"- Bat sauce: a Habanero-based hot sauce that was mild considering the base- A cave-themed interior, a bar area, and a decorative pool/moat exteriorAfter I assisted my sheltered family in translating the "unfamiliar" menu, we consumed:- Nachos (~$6 on HH, normally ~$9): Chips were a bit light for the heaping toppings- Lobster Enchiladas (~$16): Disappointing - slightly bitter and not much taste overall- Chile Rellenos (~$11): Peppers stuffed with pork and cheese, tasty but a bit heavy- Green Chile Mac + Cheese (~$6): Standard with appreciably subtle pepper flavor- Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7): Too much cake and too much sugar, not enough cocoa- Chocolate Eruption ($7): A "cake" with hardened chocolate mousse and cheesecake chunks; better than the aforementioned but still overly sweetOn happy hour, for a meal made of discounted appetizers and ~$4 margaritas, I could see this being a fun choice, but skip dinner (even though admittedly I am compelled by the ample outdoor moatside seating and the Habanero burger replete with medical warnings.) While I don't feel I wasted my restaurant selection, I also don't feel I prospected and struck pay dirt in Carlsbad Tavern either and I'm sure gold is out there.My husband and I went to Carlsbad last night. It really is one of our favorite places. We typically sit at the bar..alright, who am I kidding? We always sit at the bar. Why? Because the service it outstanding. Matt & Jacob were working last night- we always have such a great time with them. The conversation, the drinks, the food. It's like our home away from home. My husband had the Surf & Turf and I had a bite of the filet and the shrimp and both were supremely delicious! The filet was cooked to perfection and smothered in shitake mushrooms. To. Die. For. He ate everything on his plate. I thought he was going to lick it clean. (Thankfully, he knows better).I'm dieting. I had a salad with no dressing and ate the whole thing. Really. A salad with no dressing and I still ate it all! Plus they didn't roll their eyes when I brought in my diet tonic. And believe me, I deserved at least an eye roll.This is what I really wanted to share with you. During the month of September they have 1/2 priced food items from their late night menu. 12AM - 2AM Sunday through ThursHALF PRICE! The sliders were already a screaming delicious deal and now they're half off.  There is a God and he loves me! Loves me to eat  Half price Sliders. AMIRITE?!Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this bar a try one night in Scottsdale.  It was one of a few that were open late on a mid-week night and looked appealing.  The restaurant/bar looks like it can be hopping on busy nights, but on this particular night (Wed), it was slow.I saddled up to the bar and asked for a menu.  I asked the bartender if they had any IPA's and he suggested the Odell brewing company IPA.  I went for it and asked him what he would recommend I try.  Since  it was considered 'late night', there was a special menu and he suggested the Pork Loin Sliders (3 Sliders with Pepper Jack, Poblano Serrano Mayonnaise, and Tortilla Encrusted Onion Rings).  It sounded awesome, so I went with it.The IPA was really tasty and hit the spot.  After a few minutes, the Pork Loin Sliders came out.  I spread the Poblano Serrano Mayo on them and then for fun added some Fries on the Sliders.  I took a small bite out of the first Slider and it was awesome!  The Pork Loin was moist & juicy and the Poblano Serrano Mayo was the perfect compliment....adding a nice bite to the flavor.  I devoured the Sliders within a few minutes and then sat back and enjoyed the rest of my IPA.I really enjoyed this place and would like to return on my next trip to Scottsdale.Hidden gem alert! If you've ever driven on Hayden, traveled north from Thomas and passed by Carlsbad Tavern without stopping in, you're missing out! This is a charming little eatery complete with twinkle lights and a huge moat-like water fountain that surrounds the patio. The atmosphere is casual and perfect for large groups. I celebrated a birthday here several years ago and have been for dinner several times. The interior is cozy and feels like you're truly in a cavern and the patio is charming with the sound of water while you eat under the twinkle lights. It's perfect for a casual but ambiance-filled date night, perfect if you have young children and need a place that allows noise and perfect for any sized group. The food here is New Mexican and has a serious kick to it (in a good way). It appears that you must ask for salsa upon request. The salsa is very chunky and decent but the tomato chunks can make it hard to dip chips. The nachos are made with chipotle chips which is a nice change-up to typical nachos. Their go-to item is the Green Chile Burrito which is delicious. The combination of red and green sauce adds a kick and adds the perfect amount of "mess" to the meal. Anything here is good and the prices are reasonable so you can enjoy your meal without breaking the bank.Picture this... it's the evening after a long day in the sun, lots of walking, lots of sight-seeing, lots of day-drinking and oh so many Scottsdale sun dresses.  Now it's almost midnight.  You're hungry, but you're also not in any shape to drive.  Well, if you're fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this joint, you're in for a treat.Right when you get past the parking lot, you feel like you're in line at Disneyland or Universal Studios.  There is running water, fake caverns and bridges taking you everywhere.  Plenty of tvs too but I was focused on one thing, lots of icewater and now it's time to talk about their green salsa (that happens to come for free along with chips and a yelp check in - BOOM).In my 36 years, I have been partial to red salsa ever since I can remember.  That's only because I hadn't yet tried this one.  It's like the perfect blend of tomatillo, jalapeno and green chiles... best I've ever had.  The waiter even brought out a 2nd tub due to our inhaling it in mere moments.  So good - I can't even explain.  If you ONLY come here for the green salsa and the New Mexican potstickers you are winning at life.I realize that maybe some of my taste buds were off due to that much day drinking, but I am convinced that whenever anything is the "best I've ever had" it's my duty to shout from a rooftop so my fellow friends and yelpers alike can also enjoy.  I don't remember which entree I ordered, and it was too difficult to determine what it was when I finished it off yesterday - but it was also tasty.  I will be back, and will be dreaming of that green salsa until that happens.Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking. My friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it. Guac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though. For lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it. Throughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were "free" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.  So buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx.
Four Peaks Brewing Co=This is my first review and I had to write it about what is probably my favorite place EVER. I had my freaking graduation party here. With my family, 80 year old Grandma included. And she even liked it. The beer is just awesome. If me and my boyfriend can agree, it's great to split a $11 pitcher during happy hour (I know..the prices just went up but still not bad).  I love all the appetizers with the exception of the beer bread things.  They're just weird and too hard to eat. The jalepeno popper burger is so yummy. Cream cheese on a burger is such a good idea and the crispy onion strings add nice texture. Another plus is that it's not wimpy like most "Spicy" items. It's actually pretty spicy. I also LOVE their nightly specials. I've seen Filet Mignon, Buffalo, and Osso Bucco on those things! It's always a great surprise, and always delicious. The service is great, everyone is very friendly and the atmosphere is awesome. Sometimes the music is too loud to have a conversation inside so I'm a consistent patio diner. It's right by my house and I really like trying new places and cuisine so I'm always thinking of somewhere new to go, but it's great just to have an old standby that's consistently a good time.After reading all of the awesome reviews that came before mine (ok - maybe not all of them considering there are 54 to date), I knew I had to check this place out...I was there for lunch today and although I didn't even have their beer, I loved it!  Service was kind of slow but it was a beautiful day and we sat outside so it didn't matter that much.  The atmosphere and food made up for it... I had a delicious chef salad and a side of their beer bread.  I'm not kidding - it was one of my favorite lunches I've had EVER!  The salad was fresh and the sweet jalapeno dressing combined with the turkey, hard boiled egg, tomato, cucumber, greens, bleu cheese, and candied walnuts made every bite delicious!  I made my own little wrap with the side of bread.I cannot wait to go back to experience the hand crafted ales one evening soon, as well as some of the other menu items!If I liked beer, Four Peaks would be getting five stars. (I will say they have a peach ale that is realllly tasty!!) I wish I were my dad right now (that's creepy, I know) because his cabinet shop is literally right next door and he frequents this joint at least once a week. He has probably tried every beer and item on the menu over the past few years. I have been to this Four Peaks probably four times now, and I have been really happy with everything I have eaten. The 5-Layer Nachos (sofaking gooooodddd!!), Spinach Dip, Pizza, Hummus and even the Veggie Burger. They pour a healthy vodka soda and the prices are reasonable. Service is a tiny bit slow, but it is Tempe.One of my favorite things about this location is that it is hidden from the world. If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't know it was there (I swear that makes sense in MY head). I just wish they would allow you to bring dogs on the patio!If you ever get a spare moment, find Dallas G and ask him to tell you his story about Nachos. It's quite a tale told with so much fervor that you yourself might start believing in their power... And if all of this wasn't enough, it's right next door to Uranus Studios (owned and operated by Robin Wilson of the Goo Goo Dolls) so you may get to split bread with someone relatively famous in the 90's!Got invited here for HH and dinner.When the fish n chips special is walleye...well, you just can't say no!  The fish fry was awesome!  I haven't had walleye since my father died, and his birthday is coming up, so it was a great tribute.5 generous pieces of fish came with super-crispy fries, tartar sauce as well as cocktail sauce, a side of coleslaw and...malt vinegar with the condiments!  Four Peaks got it right.  Though the fish was a bit greasy on the outside, it was really tasty and fried perfectly.  There was not too much batter, so I could actually taste the fish.  Having the malt vinegar to douse the fries with gets major cool points.  Add a few dashes of salt and...mmmmyummy!The coleslaw was, eh, nothing major.  Really random crowd with many different types of people made me not cringe so much that I had been invited there.  I avoid the ASU crowd like the plague.  It was a bit loud to have a decent conversation, but it *was* Friday.Oh, and I got a parking spot right out front.  How can you beat THAT???????????Bah!  It was wicked hot in here mid afternoon!  If there was AC I couldn't find it.I do like the place - kind of cool that it is right in the brewery.Parking is an issue.  Street only so you may end up walking a bit.I was glad to try Four Peaks as I have been enjoying the Kiltlifter Scottish Ale since I arrived in the valley.  One of my favorite microbrews these days.I read in another review that they have good food and generous portions so I will be back to try the food...when the weather cools off!There are a few bar/restaurants in Tempe that are busy for a good reason.  This place is one of them.  Neighborhoody in its way, Four Peaks sits as the best place to take a visiting friend of any stature and taste.Now, this place is pretty much always busy, so if you're not looking for a crowd, go elsewhere.  The crowd at Four Peaks is generally nice and attractive, everyone drinking good beer and eating good food.  The restaurant/pub is located in a beautiful brick building, hidden among the half residential, half industrial 8th street drag.  Very well designed place with giant brass kettles and wood adornments and tables abounding around the large, open seating areas.The food is a notch above bar food.  Everything I've had I've enjoyed pretty much.  I recommend chicken strips (handmade!), italian beef beer bread, pizza and burgers all from personal experience.  The stout tiramisu dessert is great for beer lovers, though a little bitter for a dessert for some.The beers are great.  Hands down the best micro-brewery in Tempe (I think there are only two though ;)  The stouts are rich and delicious, I'm a big fan.  I'm also a fan of the HopKnot, which is peachy and hoppy (as the name states).  For kicks, take the risk and try their seasonal beer, whatever it is, guaranteed a good experience.Good place to go with a large group, a place to show a date you're in the know and also probably the tastiest place to rub elbows with the smarter side of ASU.By far one of my fave brewery's/bars in the valley. I look forward to the fall season bc that's when I know they will have their seasonal beer, Pumpkin Porter on tap soon. Absolutely amazing and one beer I actually  grew a craving for. My typical beer other wise is their house Hefeweizen with their order of salted pretzels with spicy mustard, which is FANTASTIC..If you're looking for a sweet but dry dark beer try the Oatmeal Stout, it's amazing as well. Alright I'm drooling thinking about this place, and no I'm no alcoholic just a beer connoisseur.On the first day of sunshine after days of rain, it was time to go out and play!  Blue skies, puffy clouds and an entire day to do nothing but have fun. What more can you ask for? My inaugural visit to Four Peaks was part of a multi-destination afternoon in and around Tempe. My friend, who spent a lot of Quality Time at Four Peaks while attending graduate school, was understandably horrified at my cultural black hole regarding such a time-honored establishment.  Don't hate - I'm from California!  So, after a huge lunch and a stroll around the ASU campus (taking pity on the hard-working MBA students in Saturday group meetings - oh, I remember that pain...) it was time to see what I had been missing. I think I spend too much time in Scottsdale, because at first I was disoriented. The stand-alone building is nowhere near a strip mall. It isn't beige. The parking lot is filled with rocks and doesn't have clearly-defined parking spaces (I can never park between the lines anyway, so I was more than OK with this). Also, I didn't see a single Affliction t-shirt. Yay. Both the front patio and interior were packed - I think this place has a license to print money.  Even with a full bar, I didn't see anyone without a pint glass - I am guessing not many mixed drinks are served here - lucky bartenders!  In addition to the printed menus, a large chalk board lists the beers on tap and the alcohol content of each - a range from 4% to an impressive 6.9% for the Raj IPA. We didn't eat anything (no stomach real-estate left) but did enjoy a pitcher of Hefeweizen (hey, there is always room for that, right?). Sitting at the bar, I could see that this place appeals to a wide variety of people. To our left, a group of older guys watching basketball and eating burgers. To our right, a couple of recent ASU grads we chatted with who were contemplating life plans, law school, an upcoming trip to Southeast Asia and eating Thai hummus - lucky girls!  Maybe I need a new life plan...  :)Good times - I really want to go back and try the spinach/artichoke dip. It looked SO good!Four Peaks Brewing Co = Arizona's sweetheart brewery and every ASU Sun Devils' dream come true.I came here for my buddy's farewell party.  I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of beer but when in Rome...   I had order myself a Four Peaks Peach Ale and shared a five-layer nacho dip with my buddies.  It was a busy Saturday night so service was actually pretty decent for it being packed.  Others had order more appetizers for everyone to share but I mainly sat around nursing my light and surprisingly delicious ale while munching on nachos.  Four Peaks is a super popular brewery considering ASU is close by.  Kudos on the owners picking such a prime location.  They really know their targeted audience well.  Parking is a nightmare so try to carpool.  The bathrooms are clean and the food portions and quality are decent.  I wouldn't mind stopping by again!I can't believe it's been years since I have updated my review! Four Peaks is one of those places that I like bringing out of town guest to, and also great place to just hang out with friends too!I still think the Popper Burger is outstanding, just so fresh and good! And if you haven't tried the Nachos, man you should, delsih!  I have tried a few fights within the last couple of years, but have to say my favorite is the Peach Ale, sometimes I just cave a Peach Ale in a frosty cold glass! So good!I have even tried some of the dessert a time or too, if you go and have a sweet tooth bugging ya, try the Stoutamisu, you won't be disappointed. Four Peaks still a favorite place for me, I'm sure I'll be back soon!
Tottie's Asian Fusion=May 19, 2008THIS IS NOW CALLED TOTTIE'S ASIAN FUSION. SAME FABULOUS OWNERS. EXPANDED DIGS. MORE SUSHI. Can't wait to check it out!Bland strip mall location does not equal bland experience. Do not be leary of an Asian restaurant that covers Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Normally that would scare me off. The room is full of well kept plants and the obligatory bamboo plants. The staff is uber friendly. This is probably due to the owners who go out of their way to know regulars names. I hadn't been there in months and Tottie remembered both me and my partners names. You MUST have the Tottie Spring Rolls....perfectly fried thin skinned yet plumply filled rolls served with large leaves of lettuce, fresh mint and cilantro along with fish sauce. The cool of the produce with the hot of the roll is so yummy I eat four and my partner eats four. I love the Thai section so far. I don't remember the name of what I've ordered recently but it had the best "fun" noodles with veggies and chicken....dee lish!The owner/chef checks on tables, is a dee lite and extremely personable lady. The menu is large and deserves exploring. Also a must order is an appetizer of chicken served over a fire with sugar sticks. Unreal. This is truly a warm and loving place.Tottie the Hottie. She is such a delight. I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce. But, meanwhile, I'll use her thin, crisp, hot and fresh spring rolls. Much of the staff appears to have been hired from Puberty Weekly. Seriously. Though very friendly, not very efficient. Great dinner with amazing friends before my stand up show this past Sunday.Ignore the fact that this restaurant is in a crappy little strip mall.  Once you step inside, you are instantly transported to a beautiful, upscale Asian fusion restaurant.  My eyes were mesmerized by the hanging crystal dragon sculpture.Our waitress was top notch.  We were all kind of iffy about what we would order, but when she described the green curry to one of my co-diners, who was about to order the red curry, we all changed our order.  And she was right on.  The green curry was delicious, probably one of the best I have ever personally consumed.  Full of vegetables, more so than the red according to our waitress, and a delicious creamy and spicy sauce.  I chose the shrimp to accompany my meal, which was perfect: large enough to not feel hosed, yet small enough to be bite-size.I even enjoyed the to-go container, which was a reusable plastic quart.  I'm not a fan of plastic, unless it is the reusable kind, and I definitely prefer this to the horrific styrofoam containers that some places use.  The waitress was also nice enough to send us home with some extra rice (something that a lot of restaurants don't think of doing).Only 4 weeks left at the clinic, so I'm not sure I'll have time to go back, but I'm definitely glad I went at least once.The second time I went back to this restaurant was peculiar.  The waitress started out clingy and constantly complimenting my friend, then she became very pushy about wanting us to leave.  She brought our check with 2 fortune cookies on top, came back 2 minutes later, then tossed the cookies onto the table and wiggled the check at us.  I was willing to write off this occasion since my first was so good.I went back for a 3rd try and actually had to walk out because the service was so bad.  Our group of 4 came in and said that we needed a table for 4.  The hostess showed us to a table with only 3 seats at it, then looked confused when we pointed out that we needed another chair.  She then showed us to another table with 3 seats, then started to walk away.  When we got her attention to point out that 3 seats are never adequate for 4 people regardless which side of the room it is on, she told us to go "wait in line" again.  Technically there was no line, but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either table.  While we were waiting for them to get their sh!t together, I noticed that the hostess was grabbing chairs from all over the restaurant and putting it at a table that did not have all of their dining partners.  I'm no restaurant owner, but it seems to me that it would be more important to seat people WHO ARE ACTUALLY THERE!  My blood was starting to boil, but we were seated and I was willing to forgive.We had our menus and we were ready to order, but we waited and waited.  I think it was 15 minutes before the waitress (the weird clingy one from my second trip) came to our table, we had no drinks, no nothing.  We realized how much time we were wasting and discussed getting our food to go before the waitress finally appeared at our table.  When we mentioned getting our food to go, she gave us THE NASTIEST LOOK then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted.I lost it.  I told the waitress that everything that we had experienced thus far was completely unacceptable and I wouldn't tolerate it.  I stood up to leave and she stood where she was (in my way), ignored me, and tried to take my dining companion's orders.  She finally backed off without even a glimmer of apology after my companion's realized that I really was leaving. I will not go back here ever again, no food is worth this treatment.Totties...I've read the 24 reviews that came before mine over and over, and I have to say, it was even better than expected!Picture this:Sunday evening - dark and cold outside.  Hanging inside with fiance and future sister-in-law.  All of us feeling tired and hungry but too lazy to cook dinner.  Just watched Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice reruns and worked up appetite...Thai food?  I suggested to them - oh yeah, we can't do that... none of the thai restaurants are open on Sundays.  Damn.Vietnamese maybe?  Nope - the closest one I could think of was closed on Sundays also.Chinese?  Too bad we don't have a great Chinese restaurant close by in the new 'hood anymore.I know, let's try somewhere new... Totties!  I called to make sure they were open, and sure enough - not only were they open, but they are not even a mile away!  Perfect...Tottie's was awesome - it was nicer inside than I imagined - for some reason I had in my head that it was going to be like Pei Wei - but it wasn't at all.  We were seated immediately and Kethy was our server (yes, Kethy - not Kathy).  She was cute and had personality - something you don't always find in restaurants now-a-day.  She honored our request to start with a big bowl of egg drop soup and add wontons to it!With the soup on the way, we perused the menu... I love that Tottie's offers Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and sushi too!  We mixed it up a bit and ordered Pad Se Ew with Beef, Moo Shu Chicken, Thai Basil Stir Fry veggies, and steamed vegetable dumplings.  Medium spice and light on the oil.  It was way too much food, but it was fun to share a bunch of dishes, and now we have leftovers for dinner tonight!**Pad Se Ew was the favorite dish of all but nothing we ordered was disappointing.Total bill for all of the above was $43 before tip... not bad considering the amount of food we had!  Service was attentive - not only from Kethy, but Tottie (I think) came by, and our waters were fill constantly too.I will totally return to Tottie's in the near future whether it be for Chinese, Thai, Sushi, or Vietnamese - or a combo... oh, and I'll have to remember to save room for the avocado ice cream next time!Imagine my horror when I dined at Tottie's recently and she quoted from my last update..."I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce.Yep. That's what I said. It was preceded however by how delightful she is. And believe me, she is. Such a good sport. We had a good laugh.We ate here Sunday afternoon after attending the ridiculous Warehouse Sale at Mojave Middle School in Scottsdale (think Ed Hardy vomiting in a gymnasium). So we were hungry and ready for Tottie's Rolls. We consumed THREE orders! Fabulous as always. Potstickers were perfection as was the Hot n Sour soup. Serve was spot on, friendly and playful even!So Tottie. You rock my dim and my sum! Can't wait to go back!2/26/10Came during lunch hours to check out the Thai lunch menu only to find out that TAF's lunch menu only lists a few Chinese selections.  Thus, after skimming over the lunch menu, as well as the dinner menu for Thai selections, I chose to go with the Beef Lo Mein, which came w/ a bowl of soup and an eggroll, and the Tofu Green Curry.  The beef lo mein was delicious!  Loved the thin egg noodles combined w/ veggies and tender beef.  Correction- not all of the beef pieces were tender, but I didn't mind since I also had the tofu green curry to contend with.  Took leftovers home for Mom and I to enjoy later.  Tottie's green curry has made my Mom a fan of Thai food at last!  (I haven't been able to win her over with any other of the Thai restaurants I frequent.)  She didn't like the lo mein, though.  Said that the leftover noodles were hard.  The noodles must've dried out in the fridge, for they weren't dry when I had them for lunch.  As for the soup, I selected hot and sour, but when it arrived, I could see that a thickener was used, so I inquired as to what was the thickening agent.  The answer?  Cornstarch.  And so, I had it whisked away.I am a fan of homemade coconut ice cream and fried plantains.  It is one of my favorite food combinations, and wouldn't you know it, TAF's Honey Fried Bananas proved to be a great contender among some of the best I've had in the valley (Siam Thai and Wild Thaiger also offer great versions)!  The banana slices were encased in a light batter, fried, and then drizzled with honey, and then topped with a scoop of exquisite coconut ice cream.  Don't forget the peanuts on top!  What makes the ice cream exquisite?  Why, this scoop was chockful of real coconut ribbons!  The light crunch of the battered bananas, still warm from the pan, paired well w/ the cool, creamy, coconutty delight.  Mmm... you must try this sweet dish! ---4/16/10I've been back with Mom at least three times since, as I've hooked her onto Tottie's Soft-shelled Crab Curry.  (My mother is so hard to draw out of the house, but now, if I want to be graced with her company, all I have to do is utter the words "soft-shelled crab," and voila!)  Do try any of the curries offered here with a side of egg noodles.  As far as I could tell, these were seasoned only with soy sauce, but they proved to be an excellent bed for the divine crab curry!  We may just have to pay Tottie's a visit tonight!Okay, I could probably live without Asian food.  I like Chinese and Thai on occasion, especially if it's cold out.  The rest of it I wouldn't miss.  Sorry, Mexico is my true love.  But I have to say, I love Tottie's, if for no other reason than the Green Curry.  It is easily one of my favorite dishes right now.I've tried both the lemon and tangerine chicken (apparently I could not live without citrus), and while good, they cannot compete with the green curry.  Generally I would prefer Chinese to Thai, or so I thought.  I know, it's like comparing apples to oranges.  I also really like the Tottie rolls.  The spring rolls taught me I'm not a fan of rice paper, but I loved the peanut sauce.  Anything dipped in that peanut sauce would be good!Given its location,  I was pleasantly surprised that Tottie's is actually quite nice inside, although we usually get take-out.  In fact, today is quite chilly.  I think that curry is calling me."I can't believe I drove so far for this place" comes to mind when I recall my experience here. Excuse me to my pals who think this place is all that. I guess we all can't have the same opinions; we'd just be robots. Maybe  they had a bad day, as in a really bad day - with the word really underlined, twice. Problems with the kitchen, problems with the service, problems with the fact they're even open. The high point of this experience was waiting for my friend to show up, I stopped at the second hand store next door and didn't buy anything.At this point, I don't care to remember what I ordered, I just remember trying to order it a 6 of 7 and the waitress scoffed at me and asked if I was sure I wanted it that spicy. "You can always make it hotter, but can't make it less spicy." I guess that was true because I gave in and ordered it a 5. What I didn't realize was that the waitress meant to say I ordered a 5 on a scale of 1-100, cause this didn't have any spice at all. bleh...After a few bites I calmly explained that on a scale of 1 to 7 that my dish was more like a 0, no spice at all. Her response, if you really must know, she said, sorry, we just had a "big order from a table of 6 people" if you want the kitchen to re-make your order, it will be about 30 minutes. Instead of waiting for 30 minutes, I asked if she could bring me some thai chili peppers and some chili paste to add to my dish, I'd just take care of it myself instead; she showed up with chili oil and soy sauce. :-/ Thanks, I guess. I pushed through, spiced up my dish to satisfaction and 'enjoyed' the rest of my meal, but mostly the conversation with my friend and not really the meal or the dining experience. My friends dish was pretty sub satisfactory to her, and she asked the waitress to just take it back. The waitress didn't seem to want to just take the dish from the table and leave it at that, after insisting on making a new dish to replace the unsatisfactory dish about five times. Instead of just returning the dish, she gave in to the waitress and selected something different. While her replacement dish was better, but not awesome, she ended up getting charged for the replacement dish she didn't really want to begin with.Given the choice, next time I'll aim for taco bell. Not exactly apples to apples in comparison, but at least I wont have to spend a lot for crummy service and mediocre food.Happy Yelping Phoenix.Tottie's is a family owned restaurant where customer service prevails. The food is mouth watering to look at and painfully delicious to eat. Painful? WHA- The problem is how much you'll want to eat.My friend and I stopped in for a late afternoon bite. We had just missed the lunch specials (but that's ok! more to take home) and settled into our luxurious booth. The restaurant offers a variety of seating, ranging from tables to booths to the bar. All look equally appealing. (And can readily accommodate groups.)Michael charmed us with the joy and eagerness he exuded. After ordering Pad Thai and Panang Curry he generously offered us soup leftover from lunch. (And our rubber arms quickly said yes!) SOUPWhy does this have it's own category? The egg drop soup and sweet and sour are *only* served during lunch hours. (11am - 2pm). If you're lucky some might be leftover and Michael might be around to share. You should try those two soups. And here's a trick. Try those two soups mixed together.Hoy My Goodness.The sweet and sour is a powerfully strong soup offering a kick of spice. The egg drop soup is rich (and has mushrooms, which work quite well) and creamy in a different way. Together? You've got to try it. I highly recommend it. HAPPY HOURRuns Tuesday thru Friday, 5pm - 7pm. Food and drink specials abound. Sushi rolls are discounted and they offer things like Sake Bombers, Mimosas, a Riesling and a red blend for $5. (Some other wines for $4. Budlight for $2.50.) FOODThe Pad Thai delivers on all levels. If you really want it fire engine hot they will provide additional spices. The Panang Curry kicks butt. Spicy means enough to clear your sinuses but not make you cry. The dinner portions are ginormous. You could readily share a meal...but then there'd be no leftovers!I'd definitely throw in a Thai Tea if you've never had one. It's almost smoky in taste (yet sweet) and goes down too quickly.SERVICEI don't know how he did it, Michael must have eyes in the back of his head or something, but my Diet Pepsi was never empty. I slurped down three that I can remember. And he even offered to provide one to go!This place rocks!p.s. there's another location in northern scottsdale.
Delhi Palace Cuisine of India=Okay before I start talking about food let me tell you that being an Indian student I have had the best and worst of Indian food and I was prepared for anything when I entered the restaurant.I was also a bit cautious regarding the service since my friends had a harrowing time with the management (A tale for another day). Once seated, the waiter-cum-floor manager impatiently prodded us for the order (5 times in a gap of 5 minutes). Irritated already, we hurried and went for Onion Pakoras for starters, few Rotis, Paneer Masala and Aloo Gobi for the main course. The Decor was boring and dull with rolls of curtain carelessly hanging from the walls. Since Aesthetics hardly matter to me, I ignored it. The food did not arrive for 25 minutes and neither did the pesky waiter. Looking around, we found all the waiters having a great time sharing anecdotes and sipping on a drink. Finally after 30 minutes, the main course arrives without the starters being served. I could not imagine what excuse the management could give when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant! The food was good, curry was done with medium spice just like we ordered. The naans were just about right although the mango lassi wasn't the best. Overall we were pleased with the food. Just when I was thinking that the place wasn't too bad, the waiter interrupts us, hands over the cheque and asks us to pay immediately since the cash register was "closing". I was *stunned* ! We had just started with our meal !!! Although I was furious, I politely replied that the payment will be done soon after we are done. 10 minutes after, the floor-manager takes time off from chatting with the staff and with all the "courtesy" asks us to pay up soon. That was it! We quickly gobbled the food, paid and left the place in disgust! The food was worth 3 stars but I will never ever visit Delhi Palace again, not now, not ever! For a good Indian meal I would suggest visiting 'Chutneys' , 'Kabab Palace', or even drop by my house, you will not be disappointed!
Royal Thai Grill=this is the best thai food place in the valley.  period.  other kitchens come here to learn and guess their food contents and how to cook it.trust me, i been to sawadee, thai rama, the old char thai, malee, yuphas, thai paradise.  if u talk to the owner, he can tell u that sawadee's owner and chef started coming the longest, thus their food come in as number 2 behind this place.  the rest are still trying.if u want noodles, order this "kim-mao" or tell the owner, drunken noodles.  its not on the menu but its very good.  oh, it can be quite spicy, so if u dun like it too hot, let them know.   An alternative for the noodles will be pad see yew, which is also rice noodles, but this one with dark sweet soy sauce.i dun need to tell u abt their good curries, just order them and try them.  do order their pork with mint leaves.  its got an interesting flavor and very tasty :)* This place serves amazing NORTH EASTERN THAI food from Essan region. This is an important fact to take note of.After reading the poor reviews for this place it's easy to see that the poor reviewers have never been to Thailand and had REAL Thai food. This is real Thai food.The service is always super friendly. The old man is very sweet and very chatty. It's just him and his wife so sometimes he's busy. They ABSOLUTELY adjust the spice levels, so whoever said they don't is misinformed.Why do they have Chinese food on the menu? Well, look at the poor reviewers here and that's exactly why. They're serving authentic NE Thai food here. Most people in AZ can't tell you where the USA is on a map let alone Thailand. They have to offer mainstream Chinese foods because that's what their clientele expects. Same reason the Burmese spot on Southern and McClintock does as well. Unfortunately, if they sold only their core product, they probably couldn't stay alive. This is Country Club and McKellips in Mesa, AZ, not the San Gabriel Valley in SoCal.EVERYTHING from their Authentic Thai portion of the menu is amazing and will fill your taste buds with a real treat. Explore the menu and don't be afraid to order "weird shit".
El Pollo Loco=This crazy chicken location can choke on my fresh batch of cream!I don't even think a complete review is necessary! I will just detail the conversation I had during my last crappy sit down visit.ME: I would like a breast and a wing.Employee: We don't have that ready right now.ME: OK, how long?Employee: Well we no have any made right now.ME: Ok well that is what I am wanting so will they be making any? I see an entire char broiler full of chicken, you don't have any breast or wings cooked?Employee: Yeah none is ready.ME: I am willing to wait.Employee: Ok but will be 15 minutes.ME: Ok, well that is what I came here for so I will wait.Employee: Yeah but is 15 minutes you wait.ME: I said that is fine, are you trying to talk me out of a breast and wing????Employee: No but will be 15 minutes to cookENOUGH SAID!It is like going to the sex store and them being out of dildos, I mean come on!How are you a place that is known for chicken and not have all parts readily available?You mean I am the only person on the planet that wants white meat consisting of a breast?I should have ordered the chicken tostada bowl that I ordered in my previous visit which was pretty good.
Little Buddha Restaurant & Sushi Bar=Damn Damn this place was goodDamn I went here honestly thinking it would suck and I would be writing a bad reviewDamn I was wrongThe hubby and I cruised on in Sunday night and were seated right away by a very friendly hostess. I like the decor and layout - very cool. I think red is just damn sexy period!Our server was very nice and friendly  - between the busboy and her, we were well taken care of. Sushi was killer - it ranks with the best places I have ever enjoyed the take of the sea. I suggest the Palm Roll and the spicy scallop and shrimp....okay everything we ended up ordering was perfection. And damn, the manager even came over to check on us and we had a very nice chat with him. Damn I was wrongDamn I can't wait to go back!My rating system (5 is the best)    Food=0  //  Service=0  //  Attitude=-10 //  Crowd=Normal  //  Consistency=No  //  Bathrooms=The best part of the experience //  Overrated=YESTOP 5 WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCES... For a little Buddha the manager had a big napoleon complex. I was a victim of that Waterdog large party massacre. 18 people took taxis from the Wynn... When we arrived the restaurant was 1/2 empty and the manager decided to split up the group. He was a triple threat - a total liar, bad attitude and worse breath. When I told him I would Yelp about our experience - he said don't threaten me.No threats here - there are too many good restaurants in Vegas, save your money and your taxi fare...
Mcmullan's Irish Pub=You are not going to get a traditional Irish pub in Vegas, it's just not going to happen. That would be like saying that the Venetian makes you feel just like you are floating down a canal in Italy or that the New York New York is The Big Apple of your eye. Hell, if this were true we could all just flock to Vegas and come home saying we traveled the world...and save a lot on airfare in the process. No, this is not a possibility. What you get in Vegas are suggestions and small glimpses of places that actually exist, done up in bright lights with a dash of tacky and a facade of what the real thing might slightly resemble. The farther away from the strip that you get, the less inherent these qualities are, so, since it is a bit out of the way, McMullan's is not a bad rendition of an Irish Pub. They pour a good Guinness, are one of the few places that carries Magners in Vegas, and many of their menu items are traditional pub fare. They, however, seem to be, like many establishments in Vegas, trying too hard and overdoing it a bit. Nice switch from the glitter and glam of the strip, priced more local friendly, and a variety of bands most every night of the week. Not a bad place, but if you want a true Irish pub Ireland would be a good place to look.I can now update my review for McMullan's because we came here for dinner last night before going to a show at the Las Vegas Little Theatre.  While I am not knowledgeable about Irish pubs, McMullan's earns all 5 stars--it was as good as it gets!I asked our server, Jessica, if we could sit out of the bar area in the small room that is to the right after you enter.  Once our eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, it turned out to be the right choice.  It's a delightful room and just a bit away from the music and the talking in the bar area.I had studied the menu online before we went, and I knew what I was getting, the Irish chicken curry pie.  Andrea surprised me by wanting the steak and mushroom pie so it was Irish pies for both of us.  We knew in advance that it would be at least a 25 minute wait and we just chatted and I took some photos and explained what was behind the door to the Shenanigans room.Our pies were brought to us and they were delicious.  I loved the curry taste of my chicken and there was some zing to the curry.  It was much different than the flavors of Indian or Thai curry.  The pastry was very flaky and stayed that way all the time I was eating.  Andrea enjoyed her pie, too.  With both dinners came a large amount of mashed potatoes and a good serving of peas.  All the time, our iced teas were refilled and Jessica checked back often to see how we were doing. Of course, a dinner out is not complete without the sweet so we ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and shared it.  We got it with vanilla ice cream which was put in a separate glass goblet so the heated pudding didn't melt the ice cream.  A winning dish!During our time here, Mr. McMullan came to the table twice.  He remembered me from the shows I was there to see and he wanted to say hello.  Later he checked to make sure everything was OK with our dinner.The personal touch of Mr. McMullan, the delightfully friendly server Jessica, and the outstanding food all made the evening a 5 star experience.  And what could be better than this--seeing two Yelp friends and somewhat neighbors, who were there having dinner too!  Hey Candace. and August.  Good to see you again!We will be coming back to try more of the things on their extensive menu!My husband and I agreed we needed something new, it had been a while for Irish. First thing I wanted to try the beer, so I got 'bits of beer' #3, Guinness, Kikenny cream ale, Murphy's Irish Stout, Boddingtons cream ale, and Smithwicks Irish ale. They were all good, some strong and some very light, loved them all!We got two apps to go with the bits of beer, the Irish sausage rolls and McMullan's Irish nachos. The sausage rolls had sausage stuffed in puff pastry and came with a mustard dipping sauce, they were crispy like a egg roll. The nachoes were not expected, a tower of potato chips smothered in cheese, bacon, onions, tomatoes, chives and sour cream! Like a baked potato but made with chips, very good and very big order, both apps could have been shared by four or more!For entree's, he got the Irish pie and I got Nanny Mac's Shepherds pie! Both were rich and delicious, filling and warmed my heart! Carrots, sweet peas and ground beef in a savory broth covered with mashed! Served with brown bread! Yummy.We still had room for dessert and had to try the sticky toffee pudding with scoop of ice cream! Very good food, exceptional  service and great beer!Met some clients here for dinner during the week. It wasn't crazy busy as my previous visit which was kinda nice.We started off  with the Do Dheag Wings - 12 wings, 3 different ways - bbq, hot sauce & lemon pepper seasoning along with crab cakes which were solid starters. We also ordered dinner ala carte. I was in the mood for something different and went for the Irish stew - braised lamb, potatoes & other vegetables and came with homemade brown bread. The stew was hearty tasting and  was really satisfying. I also tried the bangers and gravy which was yummy & could be also a nice appetizer. Another tasty entree is the fish and chips. Service from our waiter was spot on and friendly. Mcmullan's Irish Pub has a locals atmosphere but I felt comfy and welcome!GOOD GOD don't die before you get the Irish Nachos here. In fact just stop reading this and get your ass out here and try them. It's a pound of home made potato chips, covered in Irish cheddar with Bacon, tomato, chives and sour cream. Need I say more besides during happy hour (4-7pm every day) they like 1/2 off! All the food here is amazing and we'll be the first to admit that most pub food isn't great. The chicken curry pie, the fish and chips and the reuben stand out. Good Lord they have Murphys on tap! The entertainment is great most of the time although we've see some hippie non-Irish band there a few times that kind of stink, but still. The decor is awesome, it's like being in the Shire. The mood is fun, rowdy and loud, you'll feel like you are in the lower decks of the Titanic.. uh, before the whole iceberg thing of course and the staff if about as good as it gets. We're not just saying that cause Benji works there, all the staff are good, there are even cute girls with Irish brogues... rawr!Oh My Dear God...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with one word: horrendous. My boyfriend and I needed a place to eat and stay for a bit since we were just leaving the Mr. Olympia competition held that the New Orleans Hotel and Casino. Since the taxi and shuttle bus service was unbearably long we decided to be a little dangerous and cross the street in the pouring rain to this bar. After looking up the yelp reviews and seeing that people liked this place, we went in. I was immediately punched in the face by the awful smell of smoke and my ears bled immediately due to the bartender's foul mouths. There were three bartenders: Jason, Chris (who was female) and some other man who looked super stressed out and had a cold. I counted 31 times they said the F word. I'm not saying I'm prude or offended, I just think it is super unprofessional. When we walked in we sat down at the bar where there were about five others sitting. It took a bartender 13 minutes to even notice us and another 15 minutes to actually get us our drinks (which I refused to drink from the straw since the female bartender "Chris" was using her hand to wipe away her runny nose continuously). My boyfriend was hungry; however, we were so hesitant to order food from this place! We waited forever for someone to come by again after our drinks were given--the standard is to give drinks and provide a menu, hello?! We had to ask the bartender Jason if their kitchen was open and he pretended not to hear us until my boyfriend stood up and called out to him, then replied with a short rude "ya." Due to the cab wait being over an hour he went ahead and ordered a chicken sandwich. This took about 25 minutes to come out. As we were sitting at the bar I realized that the food was being placed right next to the registers when it was coming straight out of the kitchen. This is NOT good. The chef or runner was placing the food plates next to the dirtiest place in the bar--restaurant rule NEVER place food near money. GROSS. Also, I believe the manager was there as well. I wanted to so badly confront him. However, he may have had a heart attack since he could barely breathe and move about the bar. I figured I'd save my own breath and just get the hell out of there.*Note: There were a lot of regulars. If you are not a regular you will be ignored. Not matter what.This really hurts my heart, because I was a huge McMullan's fan.  Tuesday, St. Patrick's day, is also my fiancee's birthday.  Every year we pick a spot, and spend all day, and hundreds of dollars drinking and eating.  This year we picked McMullan's. We arrived, and they were packed, of course.We let them know that we planned to have at least 5-10 more people arriving throughout the day, and we got nothing but attitude.  We were seated in a back room, at a 2 person table. Ok fine, no worries...we'll start here and then ask to move to a larger table when more people show up.  No biggie.  Then, we had menus dropped off, and we asked how much their pints were. "Oh...I don't know."*blink*You don't know how much your beer is?  So she went off to find out, and another server came over, and asked if we'd decided.  My fella said "I'd like a Murphy's Irish Stout.""Oh, we don't serve that in this room."*blink*"its on your menu.""well, THIS room is set up for Guinness.  The other room has Murphy's."By this time, I was pretty angry, so I said:"Well, do you THINK that someone could...I don't know, WALK to the other room and BRING us one?  Its the only available table in the place, AND its his birthday, I kind of want him to have the beer he wants."With a huge fake smile, and a "Kiss my @$$" attitude she says "I'd be happy to"Before we did though, we asked her how much a pint was. "I don't know."Seriously?So she came back from asking, and it was $8 a pint. I'm angry now.  They are normally $4-$6 a pint. So then she busts out this attitude of "Well its St. Patrick's Day" Yeah.. Most bars have lowered their prices for the holiday.  Instead, you have doubled yours?  No thank you.As much as I love the food here, I will not be back.For a bar/restaurant to DOUBLE their prices to higher than most places on the Strip, AND to have rude service...I will NEVER go back to McMullan's as long as I can help it.  I'd rather go to the Strip to Ri Ra, where I can get good service.  Greedy, greedy, greedy. You guys were packed.  There was absolutely NO need to double your prices. You've just lost a ton of business, because everyone I have told about this has said they won't be back either.
Ed's Fish & Chips=Two words...Sea Dog!! Oh my goodness, they are so yummy. Take a hot dog bun (genius!), add a nice piece of fried Cod, coleslaw on top, and their very own red sauce and BAM! you got yourself a great Sea Dog!! The owners are super friendly as well as the staff. Try also the fried clams and oysters-super good!
The Iowa Cafe="Well, my wife's from Iowa so that pretty much makes me from Iowa too."This place is a diamond in the rough.  A needle in a haystack. A king among men.  Well, you get the idea.  It's located between 'Bum F*** Egypt', and 'Where the hell am I', but it is worth the drive!We usually run down there for breakfast because they have the BEST whole wheat pancakes this side of Iowa city! The rest of the food there is pretty much what you would expect from a midwestern greasy spoon, but the pies... oh the pies...The only downside to writing a review about their pies, is that the english language doesn't have words to describe how utterly amazing they are. Exquisite? Nay.  Delectable? Closer, but not close enough.  I will simply say that if you venture to the realm of this genius facility, pie it up.This is the 2nd time I've been to this place. The first time was in their old location and we had a pretty bad experience and then we went again since they've moved and not much else has changed.Welcome to death's waiting room ladies and gentleman! (hold for trumpets)First of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit.  Once seated expect to continue to wait forever for your food. We decided to sit at the breakfast bar where you have full access to the kitchen window, this was probably the best part of our experience - talk about entertainment. The waitresses are constantly stressed and do they bitch and moan- totally unprofessional.   After about 30 min. of watching "the kitchen window movie" we realized that we still hadn't gotten our food (we ordered simple dishes: 2 egg/hashbrowns  and I got a side of cinnamon bun french toast).  The person sitting next to us who came in long after was already eating.  When I asked what the deal was she said his meal was super simple that's why he got his before us. "You two ordered omeletes right?" Umm no we didn't...oh and  wait, stop, hold up...let me get this straight so people who order biscuits and gravy and french toast get to eat before people who order eggs and french toast? Well ok I'll make sure to get that next time then! Now that we know the secret our experience should be much better.We finally got our food after 40 min and it was wrong.  (boo! I'm starving!)   After going through all of that the food was just ok. The homefries are good but the rest was sub par.  The "homemade" cinnamon roll they used for the french toast was chewy and dry and the ham my husband ordered looked a lot like spam meat to me.  After all the waiting and drama this place just isn't worth it.  I should note that our waitress was very nice and did a pretty good job even though she was slammed but I bet it was b/c we were literally  sitting in her face at the breakfast bar and even in that location we never got a refill on our waters or coffee...ok so never mind she wasn't good either.  She did comp some of my meal which was a nice gesture though I would have demanded that if she didn't offer anyway.Additional Tip: For all you omelete eaters out there, they cook them then microwave them before they're served. I'm really not a fan of microwaved eggs so I thought I'd pass that nugget along.  Sitting in front of the Kitchen window can certainly be enlightening...and gross.
Dragon Garden Express=It was a Saturday. I think. I can't be so sure of it these days. I live my life with such reckless abandon that every day might as well be Saturday. But I'm pretty sure this was one of those "real Saturdays" where walking around in my jammies and showing up at people's houses at 10pm with the latest knock-off "mockbuster" on DVD is considered "normal behavior" and not chalked up to "harmless yet nonetheless annoying eccentricity".With the recent price hikes on campus (4.99 for a sandwich that thinks it's a burrito? Have your mental disorder on your own dime, punk!), I've taken to "brown bagging" (which is what I call it even though I carry my lunch in a metal Dr. Pepper lunchbox that also doubles as a purse. I'm eccentric. Didn't you get the memo?) my on-campus meals. Which means I spend my weekends at Fry's looking at the lunch meat aisle going "Hmmm...which of these could I eat every day for two weeks and not forcibly strangle myself with my own vomit?"On my way back to my car, laden with plastic bags full to bursting with failure and sad, I passed by the Dragon Garden Express, glancing at their menu. I initially decided against it, heading back to my car so I could feng shui my refrigerator to accommodate my ASU Meal Plan, when I heard the restaurant calling me.Which is a metaphor for "crazy manager screaming at me from the door"."YOU WANT MENU TO TAKE HOME!?"Nah, I thought. If I took home a menu I'd just sit there, thinking of how much happier I'd have been if I spent my grocery money on an afternoon's worth of sweet and sour pork."YOU COME IN THEN! GET SOMETHING TO GO!"Maybe the screaming Asian woman related to my lament. Perhaps she thought her cuisine would lift my spirits.Or maybe it was a really slow day.I decided to come inside before anyone got hurt.You know how in the early Mario Bros games, you always played as Mario, although the manuals clearly state that Luigi is faster and can jump higher than the crimson-hued Ron Jeremy?That's how it felt when I walked in.Even though it was the weekend, DGE still offered lunch specials. Most places, Wong's included, exclude weekends from any of their lunch of dinner specials. Which is convenient, of course, because that's when Wong's gets most of its customers. DGE, despite it clearly being Saturday, offered 5 and 6 dollar lunch combos. The atmosphere in DGE is just...happier. I'm not sure how to describe it. When I go to other local Chinese restaurants the mood is so dapper. Like everyone's just waiting for that screenplay to writing to get picked up. Like the whole "serve cuisine of our homeland" game got really old, really fast, but they put all their eggs in one basket and have to wait for them to hatch and become dragons and burn the village or something. But DGE just has this happy, quiet vibe to it. And clean to boot. The place is splotless, with a hint of chow mein goodness. If I ever own a house, that's what I'd want my kitchen looking/smelling like all the time.Initially I was hesitant to try the combos. Because I'm not big on fried rice. That's Panda Express' redeeming quality. It lets me have my lo mein noodles on the side, instead of demanding that I have it as an entree.I figure if you can get a Big Mac with chicken nuggets on the side, I should be able to get mu shu with lo mein on the side. Oh well.I took the plunge anyway. I got the kung pao. They boxed it up in one of those styrofoam take-home boxes with the smiling face. Which I always find a nice touch. All these other places like to decorate their packaging with proclamations of how awesome their product is. This was a thank you note and motivational propaganda all at once. I love the digital age.The kung pao was cruncy and soupy, like a chicken and peanut cereal. It was like eating a salad and occasionally drinking from a cup of hot sauce at the same time. The egg roll was chewy and savory, the rangoons were crispy and cheesy, and the small mound of fried rice was fine also.  I was too involved in plowing through my awesome with a side of FUCKYEAH! that I couldn't even be bothered to tell my housemates where I had discovered this little treasure trove of chicken, peanuts, and whatever the hell else they put in kung pao. I just kept showing them my receipt, which I kept just in case I had to add in the business info when I eventually yelped it. The moral of this mindless, meandering story? If you want good, cheap takeout on a weekend, do Dragon Garden Express.Or they will scream at you.
Harlow's Cafe=Y E L P !!! My first restaurant comment after lurking the reviews for nearly a  year.I was up for a late breakfast and really craved something along the lines of a family diner where I could sit at the counter, read my paper, sip my coffee, plan my day and feel comfortable in flip-flops, t-shirt and shorts. My  inbox showed that I had received the Weekly Yelp. A quick search found all of the usual haunts that I ride my bike to in my end of Scottsdale. I had some business in Tempe and narrowed my search to that area. Voila! Harlow's was the first listing. As a native, I have seen the various incarnations of this local establishment and heard all the raves, yet I never had the time or I wasn't in the area. Not today! I knew that it was almost always busy and figured since it was just me, a little wait wouldn't hurt.When I arrived, the parking lot was half full. I parked, grabbed my paper and entered into exactly what I expected. Nothing fancy but a very comfortable interior that is inviting. It's roomier than it looks from the outside. Air conditioning was set to cool off anyone coming in from the 105 that had already settled in and was rising. I went to the empty counter and was greeted immediately by one of the many waitresses. She served my coffee and I never opened the menu and asked if I could just tell her what I wanted and she said, "No problem." The reviews said that the waitresses were cute and young and hot (true), but that is a disservice to how efficient and productive they are. They were all busy, all moving, all social and most importantly made everyone feel welcome. Even first time, old timers like me.My food was fantastic, large portioned and prepared the way that I requested, but everybody has different likes and dislikes so I won't give any more review on food. Here's the kick-in-the-nuts part of my visit......after carefully planning where I was going, getting my paper and heading out to breakfast, I kept feeling that I had forgotten something. Hmmmmm, what could it be? Oh, well, off I go.Still bothering me in the back of my head as I go to pay at the front register. Money clip left at home! Red-faced and kicking rocks, I approach the hostess and explain my plight, feeling like a two-bit bum without two-bits. Got any dishes you need washed? There was a manager (and I'm assuming owner) at the front as well and without skipping a beat, she takes the ticket from my hand and says, "That's OK. We're open until 2pm. Just come on back when you get your money." She was smiling and pleasant and never asked my name or phone or any details. She never hesitated. It's not like I'm a regular and they know where to find me. I offered to leave my cell phone as collateral, but she would not accept. Embarrassed, I went to my truck, determined to return as quickly as possible with my cash. Then I remembered that I keep a twenty in the truck for emergencies (like this one). Woo Hoo! I went right back in and thanked her for faith in humanity and vowed to return and tell my friends. It's rare these days to find that comfortable, small-town trust. We are, after all, the biggest little metropolis in the southwest.Kudos to Harlow's for great food, quick and friendly service, personality  and a personal touch that went a long way with this customer.I was looking for a good diner, went to trusty Yelp, found Harlow's, sorted by Elite...Mark D's review had me at "bad girl." Looks like Harlow's could be a good impromptu UYE lunch spot or hangover recovery HQ. I had the basic eggs scrambled with cheese, home fries with onions, wheat toast. My diner standard fare. Good stuff, just what you're looking for when you need the diner grub. Harlow's is pricier than diners I'm accustomed to. $7 is a little steep for what I had. But it was perfectly diner-done and in front of me in under 5 minutes. When I lived in Cleveland's west side there was a large diner density so to stay competitive they always had specials for under $5 bucks.I found a new breakfast spot! This place is a dive; a dive you would most likely drive by on a daily basis and never think twice about. At least, that's what I did! But, I can now say that I will never let this happen again because they have one solid breakfast! This is an old school breakfast spot. It's a little shack off of University with booths and tables in every nook and cranny. People wait for this breakfast and that says a lot about this little spot. It reminds me of a breakfast diner I visited as a child or one I would have liked to find in college. The food is delicious. They have homemade everything including tasty homemade muffins (go for the blueberry) and homemade biscuits as well. Their portions are large and in charge. I had the egg white omelet and could only finish half. It also came with breakfast potatoes that hit the spot. The meal wasn't fancy but it was good. When I'm in the area, I will definitely choose Harlow's Cafe as my breakfast spot. I'm just sad it took me this long to find it!
Original Pancake House=What kind of backasswards place still clings to a "Cash Only" policy?A.) Dive bars that can't be trusted to give you a clean glass, but can be trusted to offer a complimentary sprinkle of crabs on the toilet seat.B.) Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner.C.) Cruddy breakfast diners trying to instill an aura of the "greatest generation." Why I remember a time back before that newfangled in-ter-net contraption when I had to walk uphill both ways in waist deep snow to... Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?!D.) All of the above.Ding! Time's up. Pencils down. Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.A strict "No Cellphones" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?It's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it.I'm with Michael on this place.  I don't get the adoration of this place.  It's always packed.  People fall all over themselves to praise these cash-only schmucks. So who the eff cares that this place is cash only?  I do. Restaurants like this stick out like a sore thumb in Phoenix. I hardly ever carry cash.  I know.  Bad habit.  But, please Original Pancake House, buy a flippin credit card merchant machine thing and raise your prices on everything by 75 cents.  It's really inconvenient. Luckily there are many other breakfast places who accept debit/credit cards in the immediate area (Over Easy, Orange Table, etc.).I don't care for pancakes (so I'm no expert on them) but I usually order the chorizo scramble here and give my pancakes to my dining partner. Good egg to chorizo ratio on the scramble.  Very quick service once you're seated, but the wait can be long on occasion.  It's all good though, because during your wait you can marvel and analyze the uber-60s architecture of the interior.I learned this morning that "Original Pancake House" and "IHOP" are two very different restaurants... and in my mind, "IHOP" is much better.We ended up at this OHOP for breakfast around 11am (on a Sunday).  We were lucky enough to get a parking spot and a table within just a few minutes.  Once seated, I noticed how tacky the interior is decorated, but that is no big deal.  The big deal is that the tables are so close together there is not much room to move... and that the place doesn't take credit cards, and if you order a couple of things ala carte like we did, it really adds up... My short stack for buckwheat pancakes, scrambled egg whites, and OJ plus Jared's eggs over easy with hashbrowns, toast, and coffee cost us $32 before tip.  For breakfast?  Really?  And our waitress could've told us, but no...At least they made it easy by putting an ATM inside the restaurant now - too bad there is that additional $2.50 fee to use it.  Another difference I noticed is that OHOP offers only one single kind of syrup where IHOP offers many... and the pancakes are better at the latter as well.  The one thing that OHOP has going for them is their Dutch Baby - at least from the looks of it as I saw people around me ordering it.  I'll choose IHOP or one of the many locally owned breakfast places in the future before returning to OHOP.  It was $40 out the door for a simple breakfast for two today... Screw that!My favorite signs at TOPH:*Please turn cell phones off while dining at TOPH! (annoyed by and enjoyed by this sign)* No oatmeal during summer! (WTF! LOL!)* This room dedicated to my friend Stanley (the back room had a plaque...Stanley who? Kubrik? Roper? Steemer?...the mystery remains...)Retro diner meets whimsical, artsy cafe. The front room has a counter complete with beehived, geriatric waitresses. Back room, a little more modern with trippy artwork (floating pancakes on a checkered sidewalk...kinda Willie Wonka meets flour...glad I wasn't in my mushroom phase)We had the most delightful server, very accommodating, friendly and yes...beehived and geriatric. We ordered typical fare like eggs, bacon and such and yes, PANCAKES. The buttermilk pancakes did not disappoint though I do enjoy a slightly crispy edge on my flapjacks. Banana cakes were just sweet enough. Yummy! Prices, however, not so retro but not over the top.Loved our staycation, loved my cakes, loved the architecture but not loving the $2.50 ATM charge because they don't accept credit or debit cards. Sneaky pancake people!First off, I've read some of the comments about the "rules" being "crazy" - and I guess I'm just one of the growing minority that's actually OK with being without my cell phone for a few minutes...or, if i need to make a call, i take my call outside.  It's the rude & indignant that seem to be upset about this and the sad thing is, I've seen management remove people from the restaurant because the patron is incapable of following the simple rule of courtesy: no cell phones.Beyond that, if you can't put your cell phone down long enough to enjoy the best pancakes around, then you should probably take your happy a$$ down to Villiage Inn or some place that clearly tolerates you talking on your phone at full volume.The full stack of blueberry pancakes (with blueberries baked right in to the pancakes) and a side order of bacon (served up by Cat the Killer Waitress) is the best breakfast I can imagine.  And how about that blueberry syrup with a healthy dose of blueberry's?  this isn't just blueberry flavored syrup, there's more blueberries in the syrup!i've been coming here for years (and to the one on Greenway Parkway before it closed) and will continue to recommend it to people...along with the necessity to leave the technology at the door.  Gah, get over it people, it's time to eat food, not yap on your phone!  There are several other places you can go if you need to look (and apparently sound) important.Finally made it to the Original Pancake House, never been, but have heard they do carry a selection of different pancakes. I have wanted to check out this place, I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat, and though that this could be a cool place to check out, but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people, but on WEEKDAYS only, well guess this place is out of the BC loop.  When I 1st walked in a few things hit me1) Plenty of signs on the door, inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe it's a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint, but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard, yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner, white/cream and aqua colors, but like a 50's cool diner, this wasn't an new place3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones, um ok, I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation, but people can text, and well play games, my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game 4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away, but it was ok with us, had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how it's like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners.5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block, so I'm guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young hahaAlso, again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering, and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake, and I was interested in trying it, but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes, and it's not that I was in a rush I just wasn't into waiting 45 mins to try it, maybe call a head for it? After checking out the menu, and yes they have a few different types of pancakes, but nothing really wowed me, but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha that's what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries. The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup, for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup, I did ask for more, but it still wasn't enough, some/most of the pancakes were dry, and I don't like them that way, but the bacon was a thick slice bacon, so very good, bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever!   The home fries looked amazing, but they were under cooked, the potatoes were a little to hard for me. Service was slow, it was weekday morning, so the place was semi steady , we were not check on to see if we needed/wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front, kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing.  Glad I finally stopped by to check them out, but even with the few types of pancakes, I'm not sure I'll be back.Ok food.  I have been here 4-5 times since I moved here.  I like diners and this feels like an old time diner.  The food is edible if not great.  Today however will be my last visit.  The way I was  treated by the hostess made me turn around and leave.  I was headed for becoming a regular in spite of the fair to middling food and prices.  But she gave me the push I needed to find something better.  For these prices, I can definitely do better
Pasta Mia West=I wish I had read one of the previous reviews about the owner....Until we received the bill, I thought the place was alright. I had forgiven the fact that the waiter spilled water all over my friend's wife's hands .. Twice.The chicken parm and gnocchi was pretty delicious, I must say. I tried my friend'a chicken marsala and it, besides the carrots and broccoli that came with it, was pretty lousy.Things turned very sour when we got the bill. My buddies Marsala and my parm each included a side of spaghetti. He asked if there was an upcharge to switch to angel hair. They said no we can substitute it. I ordered next and didn't ask about an upcharge, but asked if I could swap for gnocchi. The guy said sure. My friends wife changed her spaghetti, to one with a meat sauce. Again, no mention of an additional costs.When the bill came, there was an $8 charge for meat sauce and $9 for gnocchi. The server played dumb with us so we asked for the manager... I calmly explained that wanted substitutions and had no intentions of paying for an upgrade. We were never made aware that we would be spending an additional $17 (the price of one full dinner) on substitutions. I also explained that any server I've ever encountered told us when additional fees apply to substitutions and ask if it's okay....Her response?"Well, did you eat it already?"I couldn't believe it. I've never met such an arrogant manager who didn't hear us out. We had already spent $100 on the meal, it wasn't about the money. It was about the fact that they failed to acknowledge that they charge heavily for substitutions.It's terrible that they've been getting away with such rude behavior and poor service. Zero tip and never visiting again. Thank you Yelp!
El Zocalo Mexican Grill=Seems that the entree's are about $5 more than you'd pay elsewhere, but you're paying extra for the atmosphere.  However, if you plan on eating inside, be prepared that the noise level may be quite loud, as it echoes.You never know when you'll find yourself sitting akin to a 'girls night out' table, with several shrill voices.Their flavorful pork verde will bring us back, but next time we'll wait for the patio.I came here with a big group on a Friday for happy hour.  Our waitress was awful.  It took forever to get a drink, and I was only the third person to arrive and the place was still empty!The food was okay, but I wish there was smaller options, especially for a happy hour.  The drinks too were just okay.The real problem was with our bill.  For about 12 of us, it came out to be $800.00.  My friend and her mom split a meal.  When they brought it out on two plates, both of them started eating them.  After they were halfway done, the waitress informs them that one of those plates was actually for someone else.  Ok, fine, but that's not my friend's fault.  They should have either split up the one plate for them or not put two in front of them!  She asked the waitress to take it off the bill, and my friend was told to get out of her seat and go talk to the manager.  What?!  Then the manager told her that since she ate it, she should have to pay for it.  I have never heard someone act so rudely as a manager!  He should have easily taken the $15 off from our $800 bill!  I would never come here again.
Long Wongs=I'm currently in the middle of a rigorously controlled scientific experiment...it involves subjecting a "youngish" middle aged man to periods of intense physical exercise to "detoxify" him and then "retoxifying" him with things like Long Wong hot dogs and wings, mere moments later:)After Power Yoga on Friday, I really needed to "tox up" and I met a buddy at Long Wongs.I had my standard...2 Long Wongs and a frosty diet beverage, and my buddy got a dozen spicy and a dozen teryaki wings (and I thought I could eat:)I had not tried the wings before, so I did end up "helping" to dispose of them:)I am not generally a major fan of wings, but these little chicken parts were really good...esp. the teryaki wings...wonderfully deep teryaki flavor and a nice heat to go with it:)And, in a major coup for a real "hole in the wall" kind of place...they proudly display the "Gold Award  - Zero Violations" from their last health inspection...I always knew they were clean as whistle...even though I can still smell the urinal cakes:) Let's take them to 4 stars for the terrific teryaki wings:-)
Hugo's Cellar=Went here for V-day with the wife and both of us were pretty impressed.  I still can't get over the fact that THIS place is at the Four Queens!  Table side salad was great..we just got everything on it..can't remember the last time I had anchovies in my salad but it was pretty good.  The wife went with the beef wellington and I got the rack of lamb which were both fantastic.  They gave us 2 complimentary desserts.  One was a plate of things dipped in chocolate and the other was 2 chocolate coated gelatos shaped into hearts.  Dropped a little over a $100 for everything but I found it to be well worth it.I was worried after reading so many recent reviews of this place that said Hugo's was going downhill (even from some that had been coming here for years) that this place was going to suck bigtime.  Well...this is pretty damn good if this is downhill.Vegas is filled with steakhouses.  Palazzo, alone, has three of them.  So with so many options on the strip, its going to have to take a pretty good recommendation for me to stray off the strip for my savory appetite.  Hugo's cellar was recommended to us by one of our customers and he mentioned that it was one of the best steaks he has ever had.  Big words, when it comes to steak in Vegas (..and it was mentioned to us during dinner at Delmonico's).  Nonetheless, my girlfriend and I made it our mission to try Hugo's the next time we were in Vegas.  Here is the short of it:Pros:Your lady friend gets a rose when you enter the restaurant.  The amount of food you get for 50 dollars (steak) is a lot.  You get bread, chocolate covered strawberries, salad, and potatoes or vegetables.Reasonably priced compared to most, if not all a la carte steakhousesCons:Decor is more old school (or hasn't been changed in a while).  Fits in well with the Fremont street casinos.The steak and the meal were just OK for me.  I definitely left full but I wouldn't necessarily say it was melt in your mouth or the steak was anything to write home about.  Vegas Cons: In a city where image can be anything, this place just doesn't cut it.  Its in a cellar and it is on Fremont street.  There are so many other choices in Vegas that can give you a better view, or a more comfortable seating, or give you better recognition or name.  The crowd is older, not as dressy and fits more with the surroundings.  I wore dark jeans and a nice shirt (standard guy-wear) and I felt overdressed.  In the end though, I would eat there again.  However, one has to understand the type of meal you are getting and what you are paying for.  With that in hand, its one of the best deals on the strip.Now this is a Hidden Gem! Found in the 4 Queens Hotel & Casino, Downtown Vegas. Take steps down to the Underground Dungeon of a True Throw Back in Time Vegas Mob Style Dining Area.Every Lady that steps foot in here, receives a long stem red rose.. Brownie points already! We didn't have a reservation but we were given a table in literally a minute and the place was filled. The host was a jokester, had a great sense of humor that definitely set a positive vibe and loosened things up.  2 Servers(1 Server & 1 Assistant Server, Not Busser) immediately pulled out our chairs, and greeted us with much enthusiasm! Without wasting time, they poured their own in-house bottled water into our glasses. Within seconds, our bread basket (basic dinner rolls and  lavash) was dropped off with butter that had been intricately sculpted into a rose bud! Menu offered a wide variety and every other entree I grazed at was so appealing. But I was sold on their 21 Day Dry Aged Top Shelf Rib Eye that is char-broiled and served with mushroom ragout and bordelaise sauce.  My girl orders Hugo's Chicken - breast of chicken stuffed with a sun dried tomato pesto and roasted garlic sauce. Both dishes included sides of veggies and mashed potatoes. Not only that, the order also came with their Custom Made Salad and Dessert!!!!! Shortly after, a gentleman with this hunky salad cart rolled over and started to toss the  salad and asked what additions I cared for, about 15 different options! I added, creamy pepper dressing, onions, tomato, egg, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, parmesan cheese and croutons (they had anchovies and nuts too..). The lettuce, onions, extremely juicy tomato was farm picked fresh, artichoke hearts and hearts of palms added that lucious subtle flavor, egg, parmesan cheese and croutons just complemented each other wonderfully!! This disappeared in minutes.. Then one of the servers handed us over a tiny ice cream cone with a scoop of raspberry sorbet! Nice!About 10 minutes later, the servers came over with our piping hot plates of steak and chicken. The Steak was a chunky piece of meat that had Flawless grill marks checkered throughout. Fork tender and their mushroom/bordelaise aujus makes this Steak Unrivaled by Most Other Rib Eye's I've Ever Had!The chicken had an aroma that filled the air with garlic and sundried tomatoes. As good as it smelled, it tasted even better! The stuffing/sauce flavors were expertly balanced with the chicken. Undeniably recommended!The included sides were small but were a satisfying amount of vegetables, mash potato and pamesan crusted tomato that were all very good.When we were done, the servers boxed our leftovers and bagged them for carry-out.Next came the dessert tray, with an assortment of divine looking Treats.. We passed since we had our Chocoloate Covered/Dipped Strawberries, figs and apricot with their homemade whipped cream to come to the rescue! It came swiftly on this propped up cake stand, exactly what we needed to end the night right! Semi-sweet chocolate, flavorful fruits and fluffy whipped cream equals dessert Greatness!What an Experience! This place has Romance written all over it! Candle-lit dim dining room, Accomodating A+ Service, and Most Importantly this place doesn't Break the Bank! Just be cautious not to crack open too many bottles of Wine!!Hugo's is just top notch. They give all ladies who enter a rose and the butter is even rose shaped. The best for me is the table-side salad. I mean this is the best salad I have ever eaten and soooo fresh.I recommend this place for any type of romantic dinner. Great place for prom dates, anniversaries and so on.I do recommend wearing nice attire as the place is very upscale.Also, average of about $50-60 a person but worth it!Hugo's Cellar is still the premier downtown classic dining den where continental cuisine is served, and table-side service is the norm rather than the exception.  Ladies still receive a long-stemmed rose, a palate cleanser is offered just before entrees are served, and complimentary chocolate-covered fruits are bestowed in abundance at meal's end.  All I missed was French Onion Soup Gratinee.  Alas, it is not served here.To begin at the beginning, my party of four enjoyed Cheese-Toasted Lavosh and Sourdough Rolls with rosettes of butter, before some of us shared a very good Shrimp Cocktail.  But only 3 shrimps were presented for $16, along with a nice traditional Cocktail Sauce and a Thousand Island type dressing.  These were followed by an excellent complex salad prepared with a choice of Caesar, Peppercorn, or Honey Raspberry Orange Walnut Vinaigrette Dressing.  I recommend the latter, which was light, flavorful, and interesting with its different fruity notes.  A diner has 20 ingredients from which to pick, including Romaine lettuce, pine nuts, hearts of palm, tomatoes, Parmesan Cheese, shrimp, mushrooms, croutons, anchovies, bell pepper, red onions, and egg.   An Intermezzo of Lemon Sorbet was a refreshing change of pace before we launched into our entrees.  I had an excellent, perfectly cooked medium-rare Fillet Atlantis, which is similar to Filet Oscar, but here the Filet Mignon is surrounded by Crab Claws.  Except the claws were ice cold on arrival.  An offer to flash heat my entree was accepted, and it yielded beneficial results.  On return the crab meat was hot, and the smooth Bearnaise Sauce tasted great.  Mixed vegetables on the plate, including cooked tomatoes, were good, and Boiled Parsley Red Potatoes and mushrooms were very good.  But, based on the little crab provided, I didn't feel it was really worth the additional cost.While it is not necessary to purchase a dessert, a pyramid of Caramel Chocolate Mousse with sweet Whipped Cream was really luscious.  But it resulted in a few Chocolate-Covered Figs and Strawberries being left behind on their plate.It is fairly dark inside (It is a cellar, after all!), and the ambiance is romantic.  Service was formal, attentive, and professional.  Food is pricey, but the cost of entrees is discounted 20% for each diner who is age 55 or over and presents a Four Queens Club 55 player's card.  Thus, a Fillet Atlantis that is normally sold for $60.00 is reduced to $48.00 for young seniors.4-1/2 stars overall, and still very much downtown Vegas's diamond in the rough!We ate here last night and, sad to say, it was less than stellar. We called for a reservation at 5 hoping to get in at 7:00. It was short notice I know. At first, Rich, the manager said not until 9:00. I said ok we'll go somewhere else. Then he said we could come at 6:30. Great! I wish we hadn't gotten in.Let me start off my saying this is not a cheap restaurant by any means and we knew that. When we walked in as per usual, they gave me a rose. They give Roses to all the female guests.We ordered drinks which were fine. A little light, but not bad. For an appetizer, we had the escargot which was really good. I was none to pleased when the dirty dishes remained on our table for an extended length of time. I finally stacked them and put them by the edge of the table hoping one of the 3 people taking care of us would notice.Erik was our head waiter. He disappeared and I called over Oscar to order a bottle of wine. He stated he could not take orders for bottles of wine only the Sommelier could. We had to wait for him. That was about a 15 minute wait. I've known the sommelier there for years and mentioned to him I wasn't too pleased with the service so far. He said I should tell Rich, the manager. I decided to wait it out and see how things progressed. They went downhill from there.I ordered the Veal Oscar and my husband ordered the filet. First, they give you a salad made table side. It is fine. It is a lettuce salad with your choice of dressing and toppings. My veal came and it was awful. It tasted fishy. I didn't say anything to my husband, but told him to try a bite. He said the identical thing. I tried his steak. It was dry on the ends and you needed a lot of sauce to get it down.I had to track down Erik again as I was not paying $49 for bad veal. When I was able to get him and told him the veal was bad, he got rather indignant and stated that the only thing he could get to me was the prime rib. I guess it was sitting there. I did not want prime rib. He got very angry, took the plate and walked away. I just shared my husband's steak with him.I told John, the sommelier, about the altercation with the waiter. He said to tell Rich. I told Rich what happened and even he didn't offer me something I would like better. He said he would give me his card before I left for a free meal. Yeah right. This meal should have been free. They gave us a desert for our anniversary and you could tell it was not fresh, it had been pulled from the freezer. There was ice falling off of it.We got the bill and they did take the drinks and my veal off, but charged us $17.00 for the salad that was supposed to come with the meal and that was just wrong!Before he delivered the bill, Erik came back as I'm sure he was told to by the manager to  make it right. Instead he began arguing with me. Hey jerk I'm the customer.So for one entree and one desert we ended up with a $129.00 bill. Of course, I couldn't find Erik again to discuss the charge for the salad. On the bill, there is a place for 2 tips. One for the server and one for the sommelier. I gave john 20% of what the wine cost. I gave Erik $1. He didn't deserve anything. Never saw the manager again either. So much for the card for the meal.  This was totally unacceptable for a restaurant of their caliber. I've been eating here since the 1980's, but I won't be going back. Too many other good restaurants in Vegas to choose from. This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Vegas!Items Selected:Tom CollinsGin-Lemon-SevenButter Rose, White Roll, Cheese Lavosh, Whole Grain RollEscargot en Croute - Six plump escargots sautéed in shallots, garlic, burgundy wine, fine herbs with a puff pastry toppingTableside Salad - Romaine, Tomato, Hearts of Palm, Artichokes, Mushrooms, Blue Cheese, Croutons, Pine Nuts, Hardboiled Egg, Bay Shrimp with Creamy Pepper DressingRaspberry SorbetStuffed Jumbo Shrimp - Jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab, parsley, savory and 'old bay' seasoned bread crumbsDuckling Anise Flambé - Duck roasted with licorice spices and herbs; flambéed table-sideBeef Wellington - Filet of beef, topped with a duxelle of foie gras and mushrooms; baked in pastry and served with bordelaise sauceWhite and dark chocolate dipped strawberries, apricots and baby figs with whipped creamBananas FosterCherries JubileeLocated in The Four Queens on Fremont and considered by many to be the best "Old Vegas" experience remaining in a city once rife with dens of a similar ilk Hugo's Cellar had always been on my proverbial 'to-do' list and despite the constant onslaught of new spots from celebrity chefs on the Strip a Sunday night visit found the venerable institution packed - the 'reservations recommended' sign proving justified as couples attempting to walk-in met a two hour wait.  Dimly lit with stone walls, wood beams, heavy linens, and art-glass chandeliers overhead it was to formal greetings and a rose for the ladies that we arrived in the Cellar and whisked away soon to a booth in one of several rooms the action soon commenced, each waiter presented by name as a trio of warm breads with a butter rose plus the famous tableside salad engaged the senses - the later a true crowd pleaser carefully customized for each and every guest.  Large in menu with a bar that promised to craft "anything you like" it was with a stiff pair of $7 cocktails that our proper order progressed and soon plucking tender snails under delicate pastry from their dish one really couldn't help but smile at a classic done so well, a theme continued with each of three superlative entrees following a raspberry palate cleanse - the tableside whole duckling a showstopper gathering looks from around the room while the Wellington rivaled that at Ramsay Steak beneath a pile of mushrooms and foie gras.  Truly a class act it was prior to desserts-proper that a trio of chocolate dipped fruits arrived to be dressed in hand-whipped cream and with more sweets offered on the house to celebrate a duo of birthdays it was tableside we turned again - the smolder and burn of booze, fresh fruit, and cinnamon ladled over rich ice cream a refined finish to a true 'experience.'Hidden gem on the old strip.  This place is pricy, I mean damned pricy, so be prepared for that.  Either hit the tables at the 4 Queens hard and often to get a meal comp'd or pony up for this great experience.  This is the quintessential 'old vegas' experience.  When you walk in, you can soak in the sight, sounds and smell and instantly wonder what it must have been like 60-70 years ago in that very spot.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  However, why not go after the real mccoy?  Get a bourbon on the rocks and one of their primo Filets.  They even give fresh roses to the lady in your life.  Surely, they will dig it as well.  Also worth noting - The Salad Cart.  Sounds odd...but do it.  You build your own creation table side and enjoy while the meal is being prepared.  Unlike the restaurants namesake...my review couldn't be any higher.  Visit Hugo's Cellar.First of all, this was my first "Old Vegas" dining experience and it was fantastic! I had SO much fun. It actually made me wonder why we started to move away from this type of dining. Thank goodness there are still places like this keeping it classic.The hotel offers free valet and self-parking (four hours with validation) and it's just a quick walk down Carson to Fremont.When you walk down the stairs from the casino floor, you really feel like you're in a cellar. There's a small lounge/bar area near the host stand. Even if you're here for dinner, I'd recommend some time at the bar with veteran bartender Dean. What a personality! Tell him what you're in the mood for or what you like to drink and he'll make you something new and name it on the spot. Your cocktails also come with their own refills - a beautiful crystal bucket filled with crushed ice and a carafe of whatever you're drinking. I had the Raspberry Lemon Drop and it was great; the right balance of sweet and liquor. Also only at the bar are complimentary mixed nuts, adorable heart-shaped water crackers, and spreads: Chicken Liver Pate and Smoked Cheddar with Bacon and Pimientos. The pate was amazing! I could have sat at the bar all night eating pate and crackers.If you're a lady, you receive a fresh red rose prior to seating. They even have vases at each table to place your rose(s) while dining. Then, when you're ready to leave, they wrap the stem in foil to take with you. They do this EVERY DAY! Want to know what you should eat? Anything that involves table-side service! After all, you're here for the Old Vegas experience. Gosh, it is so much fun. Especially if you have the honor of dining with server extraordinare Victor. He's been here since 1983 and you'd never guess it with the amount of enthusiasm he has for everything! We started with the Table-Side Salad (this comes with all entrees or $19 a la carte). The cart has all the salad elements and you tell your server what you'd like and they put it together. If you're with Victor, just have him make your salad. If you're not picky or allergic to anything, tell him to put whatever he wants. It's quite the show and he is extremely entertaining. I had a blast just watching him make the salad! And the salad had EVERYTHING. Romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, mushroom, anchovies, bay shrimp, marinated artichoke, hearts of palm, hard-boiled egg, parmesan, blue cheese, roasted pine nuts, and croutons. There are three dressings: Caesar, Creamy Pepper, and Honey Orange Walnut Vinaigrette. Victor recommends an unique combination of all three, so of course, I said yes. The salad was delicious. This is a must!We shared the Duckling Anise Flambé ($40). The duck is roasted with licorice spices and herbs, then flambéed table-side. More of that table-side action. It's also topped with a Grand Mariner duck confit mandarin orange sauce. Served with wild rice and roasted vegetables. The duck was delicious and I loved the sauce. All entrees come with bottled water, assorted breads (cheese-toasted lavosh and rolls) and rose-shaped butter, their famous table-side salad, fruit sorbet as a palate cleanser (we got adorable mini cones topped with lemon sorbet), fresh vegetables, choice of roasted garlic whipped potatoes, red potatoes with parsley, or wild rice, and chocolate-dipped fruit (strawberries, baby figs, and dried apricots). I mean, WOW. We finished with Bananas Foster ($18 for 2 people) which is also flambéed table-side. Served with vanilla ice cream in a beautiful goblet and long, slender spoon. YUM.It was an amazing meal and even better experience. I really didn't understand the hoopla, but now I get it. Service was IMPECCABLE. Each table has TWO servers and a bus boy. Everyone is so professional, crazily attentive, and importantly, thrilled to be there. Our drinks were never empty, our table was always clean, and one time I didn't even realize I dropped my napkin when I stood up and before I knew it, there was a new, folded napkin waiting for me on the table! By the way, if you weren't impressed enough, all the servers have culinary training for their table-side cooking! I truly cannot wait to come back - no need to wait for a special occasion!Notes: They tend to get busy every night, so reservations are recommended in advance. It's a popular spot for locals and visitors!Quick Takeaway:Enjoy a piece of 'Old Vegas' charm in the 'cellar' of the Four Queens. Expect a romantic atmosphere--- dimly lit cozy tables--old style service with personable waiters who have been there for years--complementary long stem rose for the lady- low music- great food. Relax, unwind, snuggle up and prepare for a feast! Make reservations and request a private table in the back and soak it all in. Worth it? Yes! Tableside salad; perfectly cooked steaks and sides; tableside cherries jubilee; Kona coffee brewed at your table--- this place it sure to sweep you off your feet. I felt like I was transported back to the 'Old Vegas' days. It's pricey. However, it was worth every penny and I'm confident you will be swept away in the whole dining experience and romantic atmosphere. This spot is a classic  treat-yo-self kinda' place! Loved it and I can't wait to treat out of town clients, family and friends to this spot!Service: Victor was our server and he was great! He was attentive but he never hovered. My husband and I were all smiles while he perfectly crafted our salads and kept good conversation. We never once had to ask for anything and he was on top of his game.  Overall:This was my first time experiencing an "Old Vegas" style dinner. My husband knows I'm a foodie and planned a special evening here for my birthday. We went all out and ordered steaks, cherries jubilee, Kona coffee and we had our feast and plenty of leftovers (photos and video included). I was 'wowed' and enjoyed my night out. All of this doesn't come cheap (expect 100 a person if you're going all out). It was worth every penny and is worth checking out for your own 'treat-yo-self' night on the town.Will Never ReturnAs local foodies, we enjoy all the wonderful restaurants Vegas offers. Hugo's has been one of our favorites for 15 years. You could imagine our disappointment when 7 of us dined & were not able to order an appetizer along with our drinks without first ordering our meal. The assistant manager begrudgingly agreed after much discussion to grant us that request. It took 20+ minutes to receive, during a not-packed evening. Our servers were apologetic & attentive as usual despite that Jon, our favorite sommelier, was not there. My husband was ready to call Andiamo's at the D where we had had a terrific dinner for 10 a few weeks before. After dinner we requested our leftovers but when we got home, we found just a portion in each box. Normally, I'd ignore that but not after the condescending, boorish treatment by the assistant manager earlier. He responded scoffingly: Do you expect me to drive over & deliver them? I responded that I wanted the manager to call me the next day so I could explain the evening's experiences. Well, it's been 11 days. I get your message loud & clear, Mr. Assistant. Instead of Hugo's we will dine with friends, business clients & family at our other favorite restaurants: Bouchon, T-Bones, Andiamo's, Botero, & so many others.What a gem. I was pretty blown away by Hugo's in every way possible. Perhaps my expectations were low or it was just really great. Now, I'm not exactly sure what "old Vegas" felt like, but the food and service that Hugo's provided was what I would have imagined "old Vegas" to be like. I would advise that you make reservations. There was a couple of men who walked up to the host just before we did and they were told the wait would be at least 2 hours. It was my boyfriend's birthday and each year, I try to find a local gem to take him to - something that was different than the usual Strip offerings. Prior to September 2015, I had never even heard of Hugo's. I found it on Yelp and after reading the many positive reviews, I decided we had to go. I have never ventured into a Downtown casino and thought that the parking situation would be similar to the ones on the Strip. Drive in through the front and either valet or self park. Not really the case here. Hugo's is located inside the Four Queens Hotel & Casino. Google Maps and Waze directs you to the front entrance on Fremont. All parking, however, is on Carson. Because of this, we were 10 minutes late getting to Hugo's, Even so, the host had a sense of humor about it and gave us a choice between a cozy booth or a table. After we selected the booth, he plucked out a beautiful, long-stemmed red rose from a basket of roses and presented it to me (as they do to every lady dining at Hugo's). The restaurant itself isn't huge. It is dimly lit and the decor really is reminiscent of "old Vegas" in a glamorous and romantic way. The waitstaff was all dressed in tuxes and fairly mature. Our server was Michael. He took the time to explain and validate our meal choices by telling us how great the dishes were, and the care it took to prepare those dishes. For the appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. Let me tell you...they were the best crab cakes we had ever had. Moderately-sized patties made of lump crab meat with just the right amount of crust. It came with some kind of aioli but I honestly couldn't tell you about it. I just remember the crab cake. I didn't want it to end. Once the appetizer has been cleared comes the salad cart which comes with every entree. A different waiter wheeled the cart over to our table, gave us each our choice out of 4 different dressings. Then they go through the cart, asking you which ingredients you want/don't want. Once you've picked everything, the salad is tossed and served in front of you. It was a pretty good portion of a very delicious salad.Now getting to the best part. I ordered the Beef Wellington. Michael recommended I get it medium rare, which I did and I have zero regrets. It was perfect. The puff pastry crust was flaky and moist, concealing the filet of beef topped by a piece of deliciously and politically incorrect food (foie gras). My boyfriend ordered the ribeye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. You'd think after all that food, we would have been too full for anything else. You're dead wrong. We each had a cappuccino and were going to call it quits until a server brought over the dessert tray. We couldn't turn down the chocolate lava cake and I'm glad we didn't. Gluttonous? Definitely. Worth it? Oh yea.Also, when Michael took our payment, he also offered to validate our parking ticket. We, in our food-induced fog, would have forgotten to validate. 5 stars for the food. 5 stars for the service.This is my second trip to Hugo's Cellar, once again this place amazed us with its perfection in  food skills and top notch service.However, there was one issue that grinds on me. the wait staff who for the most part have 15 to 30 year here.. I asked. One of my guest was not how we say, fancy. he had questions and was kind of giddy to be BACK IN THIS PLACE. You see I brought him here last year. we had a nice booth then and were treated very well, hence the return trip.The issue came with the waiter who I was told has been there 30 years and  this eve was on salad duty the waiter began to belittled my guest with subtle barbs implying he was a simpleton and not worthy of his service. Myself and one of the other in our party took exception to this. We didn't make a big deal about it as we were in a fine dining establishment and my customer, the target of his disrespect missed it. We spoke to the other waiter who took our order and served out main course he said some days your the front guy and some your the salad/drinks guy. The Sommelier was awesome also a 30 year veteran stopped in several times and even when we opted out on the wine he was very cordial and polite.The true sad part about this is I was the guest this time and the gentleman who was insulted without his knowledge was the one paying the bill this night. Looks like next year we will be looking for a new meat house Maybe Smith & Wollensky.What in the blue hell are you thinking my fellow food critics ?!!!! If Hugo's is a 4.5 star steakhouse than you may as well throw me in the kennel and lock up the key because this has got to be the most overrated and overpriced restaurant in las Vegas. I spent weeks deciding on where to eat to celebrate my cousin's engagement. after much deliberation I settled on Hugo's because everyone recommended the place from our hotel concierge  to the Yelp community. Well I should have known when the restaurant  asked me for my credit card number upon making a reservation that this was going to totally suck. Should have listened to my instincts....We started with the mixed meat grill which consisted of a bunch of undercooked meats that they bring out on a sizzling platter. Nothing was seasoned at all so the meat itself tasted bland and dull. Plus the chicken was undercooked when they brought it out so we had to kind of guess when it was ready to eat. The various dipping sauces that came out with the platter were just entirely overpowering and the dish itself was just a pointless and lazy way to serve meats at a high end restaurant like Hugo's. Since we were a party of 7 people it was at this point that I began to worry that the rest of the meal would go downhill. Once again I was right... The table side salad was a complete f^*%%ing joke. I'm angry just typing this out. It's like the salad bar they used to have at sizzlers except a waiter is actually mixing ingredients into your custom salad. The ingredients were cheap and pathetic. My shrimp were smaller than toe nail clippings. The lettuce was wilted and The salad itself wasn't even tossed well AT ALL. I basically had a glob of dressing that never made its way onto any of the lettuce.  Everyone hated their salad. Nuff said...Next We proceed to the entrees and nothing improves. I ordered the tenderloin and shrimp both of which were drowning in a cream sauce. The shrimp themselves were actually cooked well. They were also deveined. My steak was small and bland once again. Albeit there was no fat which I will say was nice. The veggies on the plate were a complete afterthought and the mashed potatoes tasted like Ora Ida box mix. I was too embarrassed to ask how everyone else's meal was but judging by the half eaten plates i don't think a single person enjoyed their meal here. The assorted chocolate covered fruits at the end were a nice gesture but unfortunately they did not make up for the lackluster meal our party was served that evening. I love old school steakhouses but only if it's done right. This was not done right. The fact that we were the last table in there on a Saturday night at 10pm was probably a bad sign. Oh and the fire alarm went off twice during our meal. The staff never came over to apologize so we basically sat at our table and listened to that loud noise for a good 15 minutes. It was probably a sign from God that i made a fatal mistake by eating here. Never again.
Suede=I actually got great bar service here at an event recently. A Scottsdale bar full of silicon and gym beefcake is usually hard to compete against. But I learned this middle aged gay guy with a receding hairline can hold his own against the vacuous Scottsdale hipsters. Of course it didn't hurt that I purposefully over tipped on my first round and realized if you step real hard, ever so slyly, on some bitches big toe, she tends to move out of the way. I thought the lay of the land (no pun intended, no, actually, pun intended) was pretty dang cool. The fire stands on the patio were awesome. Comfortable furniture strewn about was a nice place to plop after trying to keep up with the hip hop music. What no Pet Shop Boys or Cyndi Lauper. Damn! I ran up a pretty hefty bar tab...$140...no big surprise there. I mean on the prices people. Not on the quantity consumed. And certainly I was buying drinks for others. So, I won't go out of my way to go here, but adaptable Sagitarriun that I am, I can kick it anywhere and have a good time.
Rainbow Club & Casino=I was craving a yummy breakfast close to Henderson but away from the chain restaurants like IHOP and Denny's or any buffet. I was looking for something local and good and I remember I had bookmarked Rainbow Club & Casino after reading that there was a dinner inside that served really decent food.Located on Water Street in downtown Henderson it was close to home and easy to find. The casino was small, very local and quaint. The dinner is located towards the back but there is not much walking to do as the place is not very large. The restaurant is called Images. The staff is very friendly. We were seated right away, it was around 8am and the place was packed. By the time we left there was people waiting in line waiting to get in, I don't blame them...it's worth the wait!I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the menu. Breakfast Casino   specials starting at $1.89!!! There are $5 lunch special with soup or salad and half sandwiches. Dinners specials every day for less than $8  like juicy Prime Rib on Tuesdays and Saturdays and Steak and Shrimp on Wednesdays. This occasion I was craving the NY Steak and Eggs for only $6.25!!! It was delicious, it came with hash browns and my choice of toast or biscuits.The food was amazing, the prices you couldn't beat, the staff was super quick and friendly and the restaurant was clean and amazingly I didn't get a headache from excessive cigarette smoke. I will definitely be coming back to try out their other specials :)If you've been in Vegas more than 5 years, and DON'T know about The Rainbow in old school Henderson and their awesome cheap food and drinks- well we just can't be friends. Or you can go now, get full and drunk for $20 or less, and then write me and thank me. My first trip here was WAAAAYYY back in my teenage years when I worked at In-N-Out Burger. We would get off work at 2am, and go enjoy a $1 breakfast. Meat, hashbrowns, eggs, and toast or biscuits and gravy. Since then the price has raised a bit, but not much. I can still get the same deal for about $3 and I think $4 on the weekends. Also, their lunch and dinner is beyond decent for the price. Basic diner/café style grub, good quality and super cheap prices. The same staff has worked there for years. A double bloody mary cost $6. It is just a delicious, low cost, locals spot. I feel comfortable showing up in my sweats, or a cocktail dress.If you go on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait, but the breakfast bar is almost always available for small parties. The casino is a bit smoky, but not as bad as some small Vegas casinos. The actual diner is called Images, and that is for sure a change made within the last year. I am glad there is still a place where I can feed my family at a sit down restaurant for $40. That is very rare these days, so I will enjoy it while I can!Tired of when the dining environment becomes overcast with many restaurants charging so much for so little? If so, there is a rainbow at the end of the overcast dining environment.    The Rainbow Club has been a downtown Henderson institution since 1984 when the Peppermill Group brought it. For over thirty years, the Rainbow Club has been serving quality food at old school prices.    Oftentimes, good things come in small packages. The Rainbow Club is an infinitesimal property that fits into a small downtown Henderson block. It is primarily a casino, bar, and restaurant. The best way to describe the Rainbow Club is as three long rectangles. The casino is one rectangle. The long bar in the center is the second rectangle. And the long and skinny restaurant in the back, which is Images is the third rectangle. Images (the only restaurant) with its long and skinny layout reminds me of a railroad dining car.    Over a couple of handful of times recently, I have dined in the Rainbow Club. I would experience four different items from the menu: 1) chicken parmesan with pasta, 2) meat loaf, 3) chicken fettuccine, 4) and Cajun chicken pasta. Every single one of these dishes exemplified a fantastic deal. The highest price is  $7.75. Where else in Vegas can you enjoy a chicken parmesan dinner for $7.75? The Rainbow gives a large portion. I remember last visit, bringing half of the chicken fettuccine home. The food that they give so much of is quality. At the Rainbow quantity equals quality. With the entre, the Rainbow includes either a soup or salad. One weakness in regards to the salad is there is a want for tomatoes. At the Rainbow, the service has also been right on.   The Rainbow may not be a gold rush to gamblers, but it is a mellow place to play at the bar. Several monitors hang over the long bar that turns the place into a professional sports entertainment center. The place comes alive during the NFL games. Just like the food, the drink prices are old school. $1.75 for a bottle of Budweiser is a gold rush for beer drinkers. As far as video Keno, they seem to target the nickel domination over quarters. Mellowed out after a tasty inexpensive meal that followed an outdoor adventure, I enjoyed quaffing a beer while looking up at the professional sports game, looking down at the dime Caveman Keno that kept my money in action and listening to the oldies and locals joke with the bartender.   If you want to experience one of the greatest restaurant values in town, then just follow the Rainbow.
Bill Johnson's Big Apple Restaurants=I used to go to this restaurant, long ago.I stopped going to this one long ago.That's because of the following event:I had taken a large group of people there for a get together including my entire family.  We placed our orders, the waitress got us our drinks, our food was brought to us in a reasonable amount of time..........but.  She brought us no napkins.  We were eating BBQ, you MUST have napkins with BBQ.  Well, we were eating it anyway without them.  Eventually, our drinks ran out - me and BBQ? Must have fluid, lots of fluid!This was going on 25 minutes without a waitress showing up and I finally got up and got the napkins.  I then started refilling the drinks at the counter.  Yup, just helped myself.  Dunno what happened to the waitress, but this deal was beginning to put a damper on the festive spirit and I was determined to deal with it myself.Well, that got that attention of management, who came storming over and demanding to know what I was doing there.  I looked at this guy square in the eye and asked him why he hadn't been so incredibly concerned about the service at our table - which was non-existent - if he was paying so much damned attention to what I was doing at the drink bar which is supposed to be for employees."Where's our waitress? It's been 30 minutes now and no sign of her, we have been waiting for napkins and refills, I finally decided to get them myself since YOUR employees aren't going to do it for us".  You wanna know what happened to our waitress?  REEEEEEEALLY? HER SHIFT WAS OVER AND SHE WENT HOME!!!!  I can laugh about it now, I was PISSED at the time.  This woman just up and left us stranded.  We had JUST started eating when she had dumped the food on our table and took off.  It's not like we had been sitting there for half the night and it was time for us to leave.  This stupid manager still had tude' written all over his face.  His apology was pathetic.  His offer of a "free dessert" was even more atrocious.  Give me 50% off the meal and I'll be happy.  We didn't eat their free dessert, everyone at the table was equally as appalled at this restaurant, that manager and the waitress.  I footed the bill and we left and I have NEVER gone back to that place.Edited: Here's the really funny part for me: I am a REALLY good tipper when I get great service.  Not unusual for me to dole out 25 to 30% tip regardless of how large the bill is.  I was at Denny's the other day and got SUCH great service for the kind of place it is, I tipped $25 for a $11 meal, lol.  Hey, you gotta tip em'.  They aren't making any kind of hourly wages, what is it, $4.00 per hour?  Just throwing that in there, if you are going to go to a restaurant and you get good or even okay service, PLEASE tip that person.  Without the tips, they sink. Well, when your waitress goes home and you get a manager with a pathetic attitude, what do you tip?  Yup, the age-old penny.  If I'm going to be insulted, I'm going to dole it out right back to em'.
Flicka's Baja Cantina=When I feel like living on the edge. You know, doing something dicey. Entering a neighborhood you wouldn't normally dare to cross. I go to South Scottsdale. Ooooo....yea, that's right. Not North. Not Oldtown. But that seedy stretch called SoSco. And when I'm there Flicka's is pretty dang fun. Kind of a weird sports, meets ASU, meets the gays (oh, well when I'm there with my gang anyway) crowd. Music is loud. Dance floor gets jammin. Lots of hip hop. And lots of hip hop moves. And then there's me. Yes. Me. Doing the running man. I can't help myself. What? The sprinkler. Sure, why not. They have buckets of Coronas and really great chicken taquitos. Servers are usually the hottie chick types but always really friendly and efficient. I like hanging out on their huge patio and watching the Scottsdale Road action. So if you want to have a good time in SoSco, I say, picka a Flicka's!"Before both of my feet fully entered Flicka's, I knew I had already contracted the Swine Flu.." Thanks to Georgie S, I now know why I have a sore throat, cough and achy body. Thanks Flicka's for giving me Swine Flu. This place is really disorganized, the wait staff (the bartenders the waitresses the bussers) are all really snotty and were all rude, not to mention slow as the second coming. The nicest person in that bar was the little Mexican flower guy who fell in love with me and gave me a pair of roses, free of charge. The one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers. My Corona was $2.50 and the Bud Lights were $2. The outdoor patio is cool, but it is filled with all the smokers so unless you want to catch lung cancer, it is smart to just stay inside. My friends band played (I have seen them play at least a dozen times in a variety of venues) and the sound was so horrible. You couldn't hear vocals at all. In between the 5 rock bands that played, they piped R&B music over the speakers. I thought this was a little strange.... and I also found the massive dance orgy that busted out to be a little strange.Some dude sent his wing-woman over to the bar while I was getting drinks to try and get me to join their table. She was the oldest looking wing-woman I have ever seen. It made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership. What a really weird group of people here. Seriously. I didn't really care for the food. I consider myself a nachos connoisseur now that I date Dallas G, and these nachos were sub-par. I highly doubt I will ever be back to this weird ass place!
Grazie=This used to be one of my favorite haunts in old town until the owners split up and one opened Ciba.  The food is still pretty good, but the quality is not what it used to be.  Still worth the time.  It is a nice cozy restaurant with good service, nice ambiance and great salads.Finally visited Grazie this past Tuesday after years of wanting to try it!  A few months ago (perhaps a year??), I won a giftcard from a fave radio station, and I thought that I'd use it before Grazie closes like so many restaurants are doing these days.  Should Grazie ever find itself closing, it WILL NOT be because of lackluster food... I fell head over heels in love with their Cinque formaggi!   I watched the pizzaiolo knead and hand-toss the dough, roll it out thinly, and then grab handfuls of mozzarella, gorgonzola (sigh!), ricotta (sigh!), provolone, and parmigiano reggiano (oh!).  He garnished the pizza with a sprig of basil leaf and some olive oil, and then slid it into the brick oven.  Ten minutes later, after I took a couple of photos, I had a bite of my first slice of pizza (I eventually had three- no, scratch that- four slices!) and I could've sworn I had walked through heaven's gates!  If you love all-cheese, no red sauce thin-crust pizzas, you must try this!  My one grievance (and it's a big one!) is that the body of the crust didn't stay crispy for long, but that is understandable with all the cheese placed onto it!!  The rim parts of the crust stayed very crispy, though.  No worries- I concentrated on these areas, while I ditched the soggy parts, but there was no way I'd throw any of the cheeses away (well, ok, maybe the mozzarella, which took on a rubbery texture).  The leftovers reheated well in the toaster oven the next day- a good thing to know.  BTW, I was able to sample a few sips of three white wines before settling with a glass of Anselmi.  This paired very well with the slices of cinque formaggi.Note: I had asked for table bread and some olive oil and herbs, which the server obliged with a platter of spongy bread, not toasted, and bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I'm not a fan of eating spongy bread (unless it's Ethiopian injera) un-toasted, so I took the pieces home to toast them up later.  (They were really good with ricotta, Medjool dates, and some AZ pistachios!)Friendly service; clean restroom.  Not a lot of tables, or space for that matter, indoors, and I visited around 4p, so it was practically empty- there was one man waiting for his partner to arrive, besides me- so it was very quiet.  I'd wager that this place can get pretty noisy when packed...  Ample patio space, though.(Pizza didn't re-heat well at home.  So you better plan on sharing the pizza at the restaurant so that there won't be any leftovers to toss out the next day.)8/14Went for dinner.  Wanted to dine inside as it was still very warm outside, but the noise level there was ridiculous (and it wasn't even half-full!), so I asked for patio-seating.  Service from my server was very spotty- I only saw her when she took my order, the return visit to see if I needed anything, and at the end, when I asked for the bill.  It took more than 15 minutes to get the bill, and when she did arrive with it- I paid w/ a giftcard- the credit balance was missing on the receipt, so I had to wait another ten minutes before finally going in myself to look for her.Had the Vegetariana pizza, which came with mozz, provolone, Parmigiano reggiano, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers ($13).  Still lovin' the crispy thin-crust!  However, it seemed like the pizzaiolo took a light hand with the vegetables and cheeses.  I consumed all but one slice's worth of toppings and all the crispy bits of crust my hands could find in the very low-light surroundings (I apologize for the dark photo), and I didn't even feel guilty afterwards!  As I said, I rarely saw my female server, and most of my interactions were with the busser, who brought: ice water to me after I had been sitting outside for about 15 minutes, with my pizza order already placed 5 minutes ago; a candle when it became too dark to see; and table bread when I asked for it.  Three stars for the tasty pizza, even with such little toppings.  Had to dock a star bec. of the cheesy (pun intended) service from the female server.This review gets one star in my book, solely based on the ghastly way we were treated by management after already receiving poor service all night.  Here's what happened...About a week prior to our visit, I called and made a dinner reservation for a table of 12 for the following Saturday night.  I requested a table outside, after confirming that there would be ample heaters should it get chilly.  I was told that would be no problem (on all counts), and the reservation was booked.  The day before our dinner, we had one more decide to join us.  I called the restaurant back, requesting that we add one more.  They again assured me that would be no problem, and confirmed the reservation on the patio, now for 13.Three of us arrived at Grazie about 30 minutes prior to our reservation time, expecting to get a glass of wine at the bar while we waited for our group to arrive.  The hostess informed us that the table was ready, and we could just sit there if we wanted.  No problem.  When we get to the table, the only heater close to us was off, so we asked if they could turn it on.  The hostess said she would send someone right out, and that our server would be with us shortly.  Twenty minutes later, the server came over and took our wine and appetizer order (mind you, the heater is still off at this point).  We asked her again if we could have someone turn it on, and she said she'd have someone come over.  Ten minutes later our group began to arrive...and we still hadn't even received so much as a glass of water.  After another 10 minutes or so, the wine and appetizers arrived....but no silverware.   We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our waitresses attention and request silverware, and get the rest of our party's drink orders in.  In addition, we asked for the heater to be turned on again.....Throughout dinner, service was incredibly slow, items were forgotten (my friend ordered a coffee, which came black - with no request of if she would like cream or sugar - and again it took forever to track down the server to get it)...After our 5th or 6th request to have the heater turned on, one member of the table actually went inside to ask someone else if we could get it turned on.  The waitress came back to the table and told us that the propane tank was empty, but they'd have another one moved over to our table (ummm why did they put out a heater with an empty propane tank in the first place??)..again, two or three requests later and the 'new' heater still had not been moved to the table.  All of a sudden, a busboy showed up with a lighter, and lit our ORIGINAL heater - apparently NOT empty, and about an hour and a half late.When we received the bill, an automatic 20% gratuity was added (due to the party's size) which we felt should be disputed based on the horrible service we had received thus far.  So two of us went inside to speak to a manager about our experience.  The owner, a fairly grumpy man, let us get out two words before he started spouting all the defenses he could think of as to why the service was bad...."short staffed, not enough silverware, busier than usual, etc".  Not once was there an apology for the service received.  At one point, he interrupted me (again) to say "what is it you want from me"...I said "i'd like you to at least listen to me.  You haven't let us finish a single sentence yet"....at which point he threw up his arms and said "i don't have time for this.  It's not my fault you had bad service, that's your server's fault".  I have to say, I was incredibly impressed at his quick willingness to throw the server under the bus after already stating they were "short staffed, etc".  He then motioned over a woman who I assume was a manager, although her attitude and statements were beyond unprofessional, and said "you take care of this" (motioning in our direction).  Up to this point, we had been calm, collected and polite, but this was too much.  The woman asked what we needed, and again (one final time) tried to explain the situation and the service we had received.  Without listening to a word, she jumped in and said "I'm sorry, but do you see how busy we are??  We are FUCKING awesome.  Maybe this isn't "Your" kind of establishment".  Our jaws dropped to the floor at the rediculous rudeness and COMPLETE lack of professionalism or customer service we were witnessing.  And let me state for the record that our group consisted of several high profile professionals in the scottsdale area that would potentially take clients there as well.  My friend, pissed beyond believe at this point, stated that we would most likely not be returning if this is how they treated their customers, and that our friends would be doing the same.  She replied with "that's fine with us, clearly you don't belong here".. And when we mentioned that we would be sharing this experience with others via Yelp and word of mouth, she said (sarcastically) "Oh please do"....So here I am.  DONT GO TO GRAZIE.Strolled in with a posse of 14 people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef "medium" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees....
Hoosier Cafe=What can I say? MEH.It's a diner themed to Indiana.  I'm amazed that they stay in business with that theme, but what the hey.The food is normal diner food, good and greasy, I love that old diner feel.  They have that (in my opinion) disgusting biscuits & gravy, which is designed to make Hooiser's the fattest people on earth.  I had bacon and eggs as I'm not Hoosier, I'm just a captive there.This place is ok, but I won't go there again.  I was brought here as a joke because I was visiting from Indiana.  There is nothing here that I can't get at 10,000 other places in Phoenix, except high cholesterol.Yay diner!  Four stars for the diner category. Basic food, good prices, service with a little good natured lip backatcha.Oh, and basic diner decor with an Indiana spin to everything.Prices are good - in line with standard diner pricing.  I've had a variety of breakfasts here...if you consider omelets and scrambled eggs variety...always with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Solid.Go Hoosiers!  What is a hoosier anyway?  As far as I know it is a kitchen cabinet with a small counter area attached.  Go kitchen furniture!I am so glad I finally made it over here to try Hoosier Café.  GREAT breakfasts!  The first time I went by myself and had the half Belgian waffle breakfast.  That was the perfect amount of food.  Then I took my husband back and we loaded up and tried a couple of things.  I had a delicious California omelet with fresh avocado, and the B & G were old school.  Soft, fluffy biscuits and peppery sausage gravy.  That's the way it should be done.  I've seen the same servers both times and they seem like they've worked together a long time.  Like a well-oiled machine they take care of everybody with a smile.  As a side benefit I got a huge kick out of the table of geriatric regulars reading from the newspaper and talking politics.  Our world needs more of that.  One dude was eyeballing me the time I was there alone.  I figured I was either in his usual seat (which is more likely the reason) or he was wondering if I'd be offended by their comments about Hillary Clinton.  Heck no!  Comment away!  It's a free country.  Well, for now anyway.  Unless you have a dissenting  opinion on certain topics, or try to carry a plastic bag around in Bisbee.  Reasonable prices, great service, stimulating conversation, and excellent food!  I may have found my new favorite breakfast spot.
Four Kegs Sports Bar=Diner's, Drive In's, and Dives is so hit or miss on their recommendations.  The Four Kegs seems to fit the pattern.  The original stromboli that everyone raves about- didn't impress us that much.  If you live in a major city, you can find a stromboli in your home town just like it and in many cases - better.  We did like the dough, which is a huge part of any stromboli.  It's nice and browned, with a buttery flavor to it.  Other than that we were not impressed with the fillings here.  It was mostly an average quality black forrest ham, although there were supposed to be pepperoni and salami in there as well.  No other flavor really stood out.  Black Forrest ham isn't an italian meat, not sure why they are using it here when you have so many great Italian cold cuts to chose from.  The stromboli also could have had more cheese and marinara sauce.  Only 3 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#aHBeyIiUwWA0g3ATNPnR5gIf you are going to come here make sure you get the Meatball Boli.  Four Kegs meatballs are very tasty.  Surrounded by the excellent golden buttery crust, this one was a winner.  We ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip in and I suggest you do as well.  It's not an amazing sauce, but I found a little dip went a long way.  It could have used a few more meatballs in this boil as well, especially since we were sharing.  4.5 stars for the Meatball Stromboli.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#xhW180LRrXist_kfJBrl-QMy wife rocked the boat and got the Chicken Philly.  I wanted to try the Philly cheese steak since a few people have raved about it on yelp.  But she loves a good a chicken philly, unfortunately this one was just kind of average with green peppers and onions.  Nothing too remarkable about it and it made her wonder why we drove here.  Also the potato salad was very sweet and blah. 3 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#m47QUO5PiUWFKIVpjdKciAMy daughter had some kind of fried mac 'n cheese nuggets.  Yuck!  If I never ate one of those again it would be ok with me.   It was clearly Kraft Mac -n Cheese balled up, breaded and deep fried.  Her fries were very uninspired as well.  Based on what we tried, I found Four Kegs to be a one trick pony with the Meatball Boli.  Perhaps pizza is good here, since they have a good dough and seem to know what to do with it.  I'd say Four Kegs is best for locals only.
Old Town Tortilla Factory=Food still tastes like doo doo.And the service is still on par with the food.Caveat emptor.Old Town Tortilla Factory's patio and outdoor ambiance is beautifully romantic. On a perfect Arizona evening in the spring or fall, it's an excellent spot to enjoy the comfortable climate. One star awarded. But if you do anything besides sit on the patio, you will be disappointed. Four stars deducted.   Our server took our order after we had been seated for about 10-15 minutes. Then it was like she completely forgot that she had to actually bring us our margaritas and food. Total space cadet. We asked for things, like waters, that never came. Call me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!The food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the "El Tesoro Del Mar" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless. I tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon. As far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it. I've had better margaritas at places with better menus. I can honestly say that after eating here once, I have ZERO desire to ever go back.You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium.Well The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.You would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service. Nope.This would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,Prior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up.Uncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.Service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks.Had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas.Hey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight) Old Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard.Laying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.But you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife.Only I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business.Oh well, who cares...right?There'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow. Are you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance? You both have so much in common.I absolutely loved this place!! So I'm a bit surprised to see the lower rating reviews. I came here for dinner with the lover. We sat outside on the patio which is absolutely adorable. They have a waterfall to set the mood. Lol. I started with the blue agave margarita. This was delicious! It also comes with a shaker!! My entree I ordered the carne de fuego. The steak at their restaurant is just extremely tasteful. It was perfect. Our waitress also informed us that they have custom tortillas that change on a daily basis. The evening we came we tried a red pepper tortilla that also came with a jalepeno butter. Oh my gosh!!! I thought that everything was just absolutely delicious and perfect. From the drinks, to the food, to the excellent customer service, to the cute outdoor patio. The only negative for me was I wish they had a bigger menu.  I'll definitely be back for more!!
George & Son's Asian Cuisine=Today I had one of my best dining experiences in the Valley, and it was a lunch buffet - and this is what the review is for; the establishment is mainly a full-service restaurant. Of course it helped that I was with delightful company - fellow yelpers Rand, Mike, Robyn, Arlin, and Georgie. It also helped that the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere, very friendly service, and a pleasant contemporary vibe. But it was the food that totally blew me way - it was so good! There were not as many items as you would see in a super buffet, and this restaurant is not trying to be one. But every item that they do serve is cooked to tasty perfection - the succulent slices of beef, the crisp stir-fried vegetables, the crunchy spring rolls and onion rings, the awesome egg flower tofu soup, the best fish fillets I've  ever had ... everything was superb! I'm normally pretty good at portion control when dining out, but that went out the window this time around. It was so worth the long drive from my area in northwest Phoenix. Thanks, Rand, for introducing me to this stellar place!
Fausto's Mexican Grill 3=I've been eating at Fausto's  Mexican grills for 10 year the rainbow location was my introduction to these restaurants and I eat a breakfast burrito every morning at work and after you watch them cook your made to order breakfast burrito for years you get a custom to seeing them prepare your food , So today 12-05 14 at 1:00 pm I go to the collage location which I've been going to since they've opened , I ordered my breakfast burrito and walk over to bag my sauces and wonder why I don't see anyone cooking my lunch , I walk over to the guy that took my order and he hands me a lukewarm breakfast burrito in a bag and says here you go , well I'm stunned and I ask him where this come from I just ordered my food a minute and a half ago nobody made me any fresh eggs so I can wear this come from , and with a stupid smile on his face he says are they just made it and I tell him dude I was getting sauces I just ordered it I get sauces and nobody cooked anything, and with stupid smile on his face I tell him dude it's not even hot are you going to cook a fresh one and he just continued to smile at me like all of a sudden he doesn't speak or understand English I just asked for my money back and he thought it was pretty funny . I'll never go to this location again I'm not putting down all these restaurants but this punk that works at this location on collage needs to learn customer service , Buyer beware at Fausto's grill # 3 . Will never recommend or ever take my family or friends there ever again , due to this clown . I give them one star for past performance.It's really only a "3 now" but we have been coming here for many years. They have raised the prices and the quality has gone down.
Trailer Park Restaurant=Until recently, the only time I went to Dos Gringos Trailer Park was to partake in the beloved ASU tradition of drinking 50 cent Coronas until I can no longer walk. At which point I begin yelling at random strangers headed to the bar that if they get me this time I'll get them next time. C'mon It's just 50 Cents! Corona Light Please! However, after graduating I regretfully had to get one of those things that tends to severely limit my mid week drinking binges. You know...a job. It's just not as fun to get hammered when you know you're running the risk of being above the legal BAC on the way to work in the morning at 8 am. Oh I've seen it happen! So now I've been more of a happy hour, weekend day drinking Dos Gringos customer and let me tell you it's much more enjoyable to drink beers (even if they do cost more than a dollar) in an actual chair...a barstool even. It's also nice to not have to watch where you walk all the time as to avoid the puddles of vomit on the ground. And you don't have to worry about those annoying drunk girls who scream at you to "get" them this time cuz the coronas are only 50 cents! I mean, geez, I'm not made of quarters over here!As far as drink and food specials go, Dos Gringos is pretty solid and I'm surprised they're not busier for Friday Happy Hours. It's impossible to sit down at most bars in the area at that time, but there's always a few barstools and tables open over there. Last time my boyfriend and I wandered in at about 6:50, planning to get a couple happy hour drinks but were fine (obviously) with paying full price for the rest. Our awesome bartender basically saved us 10 bucks by throwing 6 beers in a bucket of ice for us, all 6 at the $2 price, and then making sure she came around quickly enough for us to put in some tacos before they went up to full price as well. We got 6 beers and 8 tacos for less than 20 bucks. It was glorious. I'd recommend going for the cheap drinks and the great patio, just stay away from Thursday nights if you don't want vomit on your shoes.I cannot believe I am giving Dos Gringos 5 Stars, but you better believe I am. Why, you ask, is this Cenpho junkie giving an EXTREMELY Tempe bar five stars? 1. The one and only fight I have ever been in took place here. (yes, I won) 2. I got trashed the other night for $5. 3. You are inside and outside at exactly the same time. 4. They have ample bathroom stalls in the women's restroom. 5. There are bowls of limes on the counters. I hate asking for lime. 6. I get hit on at least three times before I finish my first drink. 7. They have live music. 8. You can get molested in public without being arrested 9. I always get carded.I came here because I was in desperate need of an alcoholic beverage. I was actually trying to find 4 peaks, and ran into this place instead.  I pulled up and noticed that its not like the other places out there.  Colorful, eclectic, with an island kind of feel.  Very open and airy.  There seemed to be a college kid aurora, but I did notice a few adults there drinking as well.Place is colorfully decorated, with great drink prices.  I guess they serve food too, but I didnt eat here.  Great alternative to your typical place.
Uncle Sal's Italian Restaurant=I have such conflict leaving a 1 star review for Uncle Sal's. Why? Because I LOVE Uncle Sal's food. I have been eating here off and on for years and live close by. Make no mistake; it's some of the tastiest Italian fare around--I have never had a bad meal. The problem? A cockroach infestation. Yes--infestation. One need only keep ones eyes open. In June, I went to eat for my birthday. As we were sitting awaiting our meal, a small cockroach scurried across our table. Ok--one measly roach--I can handle that as an anomaly. But when I went back again in about 4 weeks with a friend for lunch, we waited in a back booth (for 20 minutes I might add) for someone to take our order (that's a whole other story--seems the lunch wait staff becomes somewhat frazzled when they get a rush--an acknowledgement, or a simple "haven't forgotten about you, will be right there" would have sufficed)--we sat waiting and as we both looked at the brick wall over the heads of a table of some gentlemen having a biz lunch, we both noticed 2-3 little roaches darting in and out of the cracks of the wall. My friend and I simultaneously said: "are you seeing what I am seeing?" And agreed in unison to leave. As we passed our apparition of a wait person on our way out, I informed this person that we were leaving and why. She simply looked at me with very little expression and said (I kid you not) "oh, I know we have roaches, they are just active because we sprayed recently". I informed her that one scurried across my table a month ago as well. She just shrugged. Sigh. Sorry to do this to you Uncle Sal's, but until you can have someone get in there and bomb the place, And claim you are roach free, I simply have no interest in sharing my meal with an army of 6 legged buggies. I can only imagine how many of them could be lurking in the kitchen and I am no wuss. Beware. Sad state of affairs. I miss you, Uncle Sal's, but not that much.
Italian Grotto=Calamari, overcooked. 2 orders of veal, overcooked. Drunk guy walking around the entire meal screaming? priceless.When we arrived, we ordered a beer each and some calamari to hold us over until the Cal game started. The gal behind the bar was somewhat "rude" to begin with (maybe she had a bad day?). We then ordered salad and pasta for dinner with wine. She was "perturbed" that we were planning to share the order rather than order an entree each. The game finally started and fans for both teams were rooting/screaming as usual and the owner came over to me and told me I was "too loud"---even though everyone else was cheering all the same. We even bought a beer for the guy sitting next to us (who was betting on Louisville). She wrote up our bill even though we weren't finished with the meal (nor possible ordering of dessert, etc.) and told us to leave.When we asked her why she said we had been there long enough. (???) She even threatened to black out all of the TV's (there were about half a dozen). We were absolutely dumbfounded. This is the kicker: we have frequented The Grotto for the past 4 years during spring training, tip well, and considered ourselves "regulars" (we became acquainted with everyone that worked there including the owner) but this gal behind the bar was new to us. Who knows the real reason--we are still scratching our heads! However, we will no longer patronize such rude service.  As 4 year patrons, we are no longer supporting their establishment.  We've been discovering how Scottsdale has been booming with new eateries----from excellent sports bars with great food, service , wine menu and draft beer selections to nice linen tablecloth dining experiences.  We certainly don't need to be insulted by those at The ?Grotto anymore.Made a reservation for 730 on a Saturday night (a busy time...obviously). Showed up at 725 to find a long line full of other kind folks in small parties (2-3 people) who had made reservations and were waiting to be seated while other groups of folks walked up and got seated immediately.......needless to say we left (so, no I didn't try the food...I'm sure it's great but I don't take my business to places that treat customer's this way). Working in the industry has soured me on places like this. Customer service is the ultimate....if you take reservations you should keep them and be fair with your seating priorities.DO NOT GO HERE....unless you enjoy spending 200 dollars in under an hour and geting told to leave by  the crack head alcoholic owner. After spending less than an hour and still with wine in our glasses - he walked up and  pulled the table back away from us and said to leave because he had a "wait". I had been there several times and used to reccomend this place but NO way now. I told him that I would no longer support his restaurant with horrible service like that and his response was (in front of my guests and other tables around):"You think I care? Look at my wait, get the hell out. Go get laid and quit busting my balls."I hope people don't support service like that because there are a ton of other restaurants in Scottsdale with better service and better food.....We too never got an opportunity to eat here.  After waiting at the door behind a party of 4 for about 5 minutes with no host or hostess I asked the party in front of us how long the wait was.  They said they did not know but had been waiting there for 10 mintues waiting to be greeted.  I decided to walk into the restaurant and look for some help.  I spotted a server and smiled and asked what the wait time was explaining that no one was there to greet us.  He looked as though he was going to help and started walking towards me and then past me and said they were busy.  No sorry someone will be right with you we are a little busy.  Just a rude curt get out of my way kind of attitude.  I walked right back to our party of four and said this place is rude let's get out of here.  We went to Bucca Di Beppo across the way and were greeted with big smiles and open arms.  The staff was amazing!  Shaken by my experience with the rude waiter I asked our waiter at Bucca to provide me with a duplicate receipt of our dinner bill.  I took the receipt back to Italian Grotto and wanted to speak to a manager explaining how they lost the business due to a rude waiter.  Well I never showed the receipt because again there was no host in the lobby so I proceed to walk into the restuarant to find the manager.  I was stopped by a halfbaked and drunk man with an empty bottle of wine in his hand in a gray shirt with gray hair and two diamond earrings in his ear.  He approached me and said you looking for someone.  I replied yes the owner or manager please.  He stood there and acted as though he were the person.  I asked are you the owner?  He said why are you asking me questions? I never asked you questions?  I turned to my friend and said they cannot be the owner.  I again asked and got the same response.  He ordered us out of the dining room and told us to talk to him on the tile area considered their tiny lobby.  I walked back and he was beligerent and drunk and proceeded to tell me that I was the rudest person he ever met.  Complete whackjob!  I agree that friends have to be writing these positive reviews.  Dick's Last Resort known to be rude on purpose posed as angels to this place.Not only did our inattentive waiter bring my fiancé the totally wrong meal from what we ordered, he tried to argue with us that it was what we asked for, and then tried to charge us for it! They took away his untouched dinner and when we asked why it couldn't be replaced with what we ordered or if it could be deducted from the bill, the waiter exclaimed, "Well who do you expect to pay for this?!" We were so taken aback by his rudeness and unprofessionalism that we were left speechless. When we asked to speak with the manager, he advised we "take it off his tip." The server's tip didn't cover the cost of the meal we never received nor ate! Finally after waiting around a half hour the server deducted $20 off our bill.  We go out to eat easily 5-6 times a week, and never in my life have I been so disrespected and treated so poorly by a restaurant staff.  To top it off, as we were leaving, the manager yelled out the door, "He took your meal off the bill and you still stiff him on the tip?! Don't come back here again." I cried back, "We paid for a meal we never got!"  I am still left in utter amazement that an establishment like this exists in which customers are treated in such a demeaning and ungracious manner.  I am disgusted by the experience and can only hope that this establishment suffers greatly for their offenses.If I could give zero stars I would. Worst host service I've ever experienced. Not even very busy but the idiot at the door couldn't tell us how long the wait was. Seemed to be drunk or high. Asked several times but I don't think he could add or tell time. Never got an answer. I'd suggest you cross the street to Bucca.Made a reservation but they did not honor it. Employees kept dismissing me when I would try to talk to them. One of there employees very rudely told me to stand back when I was simply trying to ask about my reservation. If the food is good, I wouldn't know but the service was absolutely lousy.Can I give negative stars? My boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said "here's your check please pay and leave." I said "Excuse me" and he responded "You are a waste of space at my bar." I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded "are you serious?" All he said was "Leave" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, "Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway." As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said "I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me.Went back to Grotto for the first time in many years.  I was a fan then, I still am.The restaurant is loud.  It's crowded.  And the food is good.  We started with mussels portifino (a white wine and garlic broth).  I liked that the dish was available in two sizes, the small being perfect for an app for two.  A little more bread to soak up the broth would have been nice, though.I also had a special of sea bass over ravioli topped with marinara.  I liked all the components except I never seem to learn I'm not so big on seafood with marinara.  The sea bass was a generous portion, and cooked perfectly, as was the ravioli.  I had a little bit of plate envy over my husband's halibut with a lemon butter sauce.  I had this dish the last time and loved it!Service was average.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but not really friendly.  He oddly never made eye contact (not sure if he was always looking at something/someone else or just weird) and he rattled off the specials way too quickly.   Certainly not bad enough to deter me from going again.  But someone remind me not to order seafood in red sauce!I sent my family tonight for dinner. They had a reservation for 7pm. At 7:30when my brother asked about the table the VERY rude owner Charlie told them toleave? HORRIBLE. Who does that to a party of 8 with 3 young children afterwaiting 45 minutes? Terrible customer service. UNBELIEVABLE. Do notgo to this restaurant!I hadn't been there in about 3 years. The food was delicious. But the waiter RAISED THE PRICE ON ME,,,IT WAS A PRICE which was not the price on the menu!!  I saw a menu for lunch, but then the waiter raised the price by $5.00 dollars MORE for my entree and an extra dollar for my iced tea! I didn't really think about it until I got outside, thinking that the lunch I had bought was a bit too expensive, while rechecking the lunch menu posted outside. I had already paid for my meal and left. He had definately raised the price on my lunch meal by $5.00!!! There seems to be somekind of SCAM going on over there. Maybe the owner wasn't around...This place is horrible. I wish I could tell you the chicken is rubber. I wish I could explain how rude the waiter was when he spilled scalding soup on my friends lap. The reason I can't tell you any of this is because my friends and I never got in. We arrived slightly early and spotted a parking spot right in front. Boom parking karma (Screeching brakes) until we can't fully pull in to the spot because of a drunken tweaker straddling the sidewalk. Should have tipped us off to how the evening was going to unfold. After sending ahead our low man on the totem pole we are told there will be a wait. Hey no problemo. It's 7:55 and we've got an 8:00 reservation. As we hang outside it becomes glaringly obvious this joint has no intentions of seating any of the folks who are waiting WITH RESERVATIONS. As we wait one of our group says he was tipped off to this place listening to a local San Francisco sports show. Lo and behold there is said morning show host Murphy(must be tough being named after a wedgie) blocking the front entrance and generally acting like a douche. Eventually we reached the breaking point and left when the host informed us that it would be a 90 minute wait from our reservation time. HA. The positive to the whole experience was the CD we bought off some dude outside while we waited. It had some awesome beats and the legendary track 7 titled "Who the F**k are you?" came in handy when we circled the block and bumped the radio to 11 while letting Murph know he is a tool. Hey maybe next year I'll actually get inside to try some food.The inebriated owner commanded us, mere pawns in his game of drunk restaurant chess, to a table in the back with his index finger, very much resembling in manner an old nonchalant cavalry brigadier. That same finger told us, dummies, to wait for minutes next to the table while it got cleaned. But it was a different finger that kicked us out of the restaurant for asking the owner - who happened to also be our waiter - to repeat something he mentioned from his improvised lunch menu. This was the middle finger, which he flipped at us along with a healthy dose of swearing and insults in his determination to make sure that we would never again return to his glorious establishment for our terrible misconduct. But that particular finger came out only after our table was swept away from us in a fury of hate and madness as innocent bystanders watched in horror. We exited the restaurant in silence and humiliation for our contemptible actions. Never again would we stand up for our right to repeat what a waiter says - lesson learned! And never would we receive the honor of trying one of the Grotto's legendary food offerings. Confused? Then my review has served its purpose. My feeling of confusion lingered on that day, and only after my thought process finally cleared a bit did I start to comprehend the fact that this was undeniably the most repulsive restaurant experience of my life. Thanks to the Grotto, my standards for restaurant service have sank to the bottom of Mariana's Trench! In retrospect, since this episode, I am actually really enjoying visits to very average restaurants. My ultimate recommendation to fellow Yelpers: when your standards for restaurant service become impossible to satisfy and you see yourself handing out a bunch of 3 star reviews, do yourself a favor and pay the Italian Grotto a visit!Came here to celebrate a special event. Decided on Grotto because of the reviews but couldn't be disappointed more. Rude and disrespectful owner/server who was very judgmental. We ended up leaving due to his demeanor and treatment. Want a similar experience? Make reservations and enter at  your own risk.As soon as we walked in, the greasy haired "Guy" walked up to me and said, "You look young...." I'm thinking, "Was I just insulted?". So I asked my daughter and she said, "Geez! I think so?" The night went DOWNHILL from there. I was publicly chastised for listening to a message on my cell - from my deployed Son, by the way, and the wine menu was yanked from my hand and I was ordered to have the big red wine that I didn't want and didn't enjoy. So I ordered my own bottle and ended up paying for both. Be warned - the wine list is very, very thin. This guy gives Snottsdale a BAD name. After spending a couple of hundreds, I left angry, humiliated and almost forgot what I ate because I hated this Maniac so much for almost ruining a well deserved night out with my family. The food? Pretty good for way overpriced Italian. Too bad there is such a big DISCONNECT between the front of the house and the kitchen. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of some of the better Italian food found in the area. I'll spend my discretionary income where it is appreciated and hope to God that someone gets rid of that JERK. NO GO GROTTO says it all. Thanks for reading! In All Sincerity, FoodBloggerIf I could, I would give this place zero stars! The food was not bad but if you like to be treated rudely and enjoy crappy service then this is a place for you! Right when we were seated my husband wanted to get up and leave but we were in a large group so out of respect for everyone else who was hungry in our group we stayed.Good food. Worst dining experience ever. The waiter was extremely rude. Will never go here again.The worst customer experience ever!!! For such a small place, you would think they'd care about keeping patrons happy. But our waiter was rude and impersonal and the owner approached the table and was even worse!! Would not recommend. Spend your $$$$ elsewhere.Let me start by saying, I work in television. Specifically, I work on television shows that rip managers like the one here new assholes in front of millions of people. Say what you want about Kitchen Nightmares, Bar Rescue and Kitchen Impossible, but we take people like the manager that works here and kick them to the curb where lowlifes like her belong. The only thing I can say is I WISH we were shooting this bar so I could give this bitch what she deserves. The following is a detailed encounter with the WORST MANAGER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER. Skip to the second to last paragraph if you just want the punchline. I'll understand. I'll set the scene for you: It's a Thursday night, my crew and I are on location working on said television show in Scottsdale. My boyfriend is from New York and we were looking to catch the Knicks game. Alas, we were pointed to "the best Italian joint in Arizona" by a neighboring bar owner. We walk on over and set up shop in a lovely little bar, we chat it up with the Bartender, TR, he's great, welcoming, from jersey, he even shares tales of the owner's history in New York. Everything is going swimmingly, what a great night out with friends, right? We order a few appetizers  bucket of clams, bucket of mussels and 3 light beers. All delicious. Atmosphere is beautiful, great old school music, just a great New Yorker's bar. One of our guys is an HUGE Ucla fan so of course, he brought his Ipad with him so he could stream the UCLA game. This is where shit begins to quickly go south. My friend asks the TR if he could use the wireless to stream a little better. TR kindly directs us to a heavy set, dark haired woman bundled up like she's never been in weather below 80 degrees before. My friend kindly approaches her and asks if she's the manager. Her reply: "I don't work here".... hmmm My friend and I are perplexed... Well that strange because  TR just said you were the manager. My friend, confused, turned to TR assuming he must have asked the wrong woman. Nope, that was her and she just told us she didn't work here. Annoyed but polite, my friend leans over to her to get her attention and confront her about saying she didn't work here. He's joking with her at first, with a smile on his face. Her quip back to my friend, no lie this is what she said, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?". My friend is taken back by her aggressive nature and explains all he was going to ask was if he could use the internet. She aggressively tells him she doesn't know the password and walks to the end of the bar, yells over customers to TR (the nicest bartender on the planet) not to direct customers to her and if they want internet "THEY CAN PAY FOR 4G"**Personal Note: Bitch, we have 4G.We kept our mouths shut until we finished our drinks and food. Contemplated staying because the locals at the bar acknowledged the manager is known for being a bitch. TR was so great and welcoming and apologized for her behavior. Sadly, despite TR's attempt, we had to leave out of purpose alone. We close our tab, take care of TR because he's awesome and make our way to the door. Before making our way completely out the door, my friend leans over to the manager and QUIETLY lets her know A) She's a terrible manager and B) we're leaving because of her. That's when she literally went Cat. 5-Batshit-Crazy on us. Screaming at my friend in front of the ENTIRE Restaurant, "DON'T POINT YOUR FINGER AT ME!!!" "IF YOU WEREN'T SO CHEAP TO PAY FOR 4G YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM" We let her know politely we're leaving and she's acting crazy to her reply, "LEAVE MOTHER FUCKERS!" Yep. She called us mother fuckers for asking if we could use the internet. "DON'T FUCKING COME BACK HERE YOU CHEAP ASSHOLES." Yep. That was another one that really stood out. It's a shame. We roll with a crew of 60 people and every city we're in, we take over a local bar and restaurant for the 3 weeks we're in town. We understand the hospitality industry and we applaud great work and most of the time overlook bad behavior. I can honestly say I've never experienced such shocking behavior from anyone in the industry ever. I'm still completely blown away by how incredibly aggressive this woman was and how such a great place can employ such toxic behavior. I can say, despite TR's attempt to get us to come back, myself, nor anyone from our crew will bring business here while we're in town. With Love, KOne of the worst experiences I've ever had in Scottsdale.  These folks need to head back to NYC and take their terrible food, service and bad attitude with them.   I cannot believe all the good reviews here.   There were eight of us so they automatically add the tip and boy did we pay for it.   The terrible waiter who admitted he was from buffalo complained about us right to our face and the odd thing is we didn't do anything at all.  Owner came over at the end of he night and told me that you don't have to like everybody as he doesn't like his ex wives (?) and they didn't need our business as they're always packed. He also suggested I write a terrible review so I thought I should.  Food is expensive and below average. Definitely not worth it.After a few months in India, I came back to good ol' Scottsdale to enjoy some western food. Decided to walk into Italian Grotto given the positive reviews.  Huge Mistake!Someone must be pumping up the stats of this place because my experience was absolutely awful. The owner appeared to be drunk and  harassing other patrons; thankfully not us!  The waitstaff was extremely rude and standoff-ish.  Our server gave us one minute to decide after he gave us the menus and then started being condescending because we were still reading through the choices.  Maybe he had somewhere more important to be? The salads came warm, the pasta came cold, and the water/napkins were never reloaded. There are several good Italian options in Scottsdale and this one's not worth another look. I don't post many reviews, but I would be doing a huge disservice to the Yelp community if I let this experience pass. This place must stay open because of its location because it has nothing else going for it. I wouldn't give this place another hard earned dime!Pros -- LocationCons -- Ugh, where do I start? Everything else.This place is a pit! My first and last time ever eating at this place! Our server seems like he just hates his job and hates dealing with people ... The owner who was definitely drunk didn't listen to the problem I was having with my meal before blowing up... So here's what happened we walked in and it took 5 mins before anyone came to seat us, no biggie . The server comes up no apology or anything,but again no biggie . We are seated next to the kitchen door even though there are multiple tables available. I'm hungry so I don't say anything but at this point I'm feeling like this guy has something personal against me haha. He hands us our menus and walks away. No drink orders or anything! So I call him back and ask him to take our drink orders and he still has no apology... Who trained this guy? So he comes back to take our orders and I ordered the red snapper and my girlfriend orders a plate of spaghetti. The food arrives and to be honest it smelled good and I was excited to chow down... I took a bite and the taste was just off... I tried to eat it any way because I really didn't feel like dealing with the server again. But after maybe 5 bites I couldn't take anymore... I called over the server and told him that I think the fish may be old and that it has a bad taste he just looked at me like I was an idiot... And I  guess the owner heard me because he rushed to the table basically yelling that his fish is fresh and that the fish I was eating was just shipped that morning... I waited for him to finish and asked for my money back and told him we would take our business elsewhere. His face got red like I asked if I could kiss his wife or something...  He yells a bit louder now that the fish was half eaten and that we would have to pay for it... By this time the whole room is staring at us. I threw down some cash on the table and my girlfriend and I walked out.... This was by far the weirdest, worst restaurant experience of my life... These guys need to be shut down or need a change of ownership... You can't treat people the way they do and just get away with it because they are a " New York" style restaurant ... I've been to New York and the cabbies have more class than this man... Their 3 1/2 star rating is a joke!!Just left the place, at home now waiting for a pizza as we left this place in disgust! Not only are we disgusted at the NASTY BUG! (see the last picture) in my friends salad but also at the attitude server Henry gave us as we pointed this out to him. He insisted in a rude manner that this was an anchovie. I'm pretty sure anchovies don't have legs and wings and look like a freaking BUG. I know he didn't want to make a scene for the parties around us, so he tried to make us look stupid. Well sorry Henry, the only stupid one here is you, especially for telling us to "just leave" after you failed to accept this mistake. That's the worst thing you can do to your costumers who have frequented this place. HORRID!we figure this place stays busy and open because of its amazing location. that's all it has going for it.Horrible horrible horrible.....Is that the soup nazi I see in the kitchen....no its the owner...OMG stay far far away.....If you look at my two other Yelp reviews, you will see positive reviews of a couple of restaurants I've been to. Normally, if a restaurant is lame, which is rare, I won't even review it. But I am going to enjoy eviscerating this truly repulsive restaurant, not for the food, which was somewhat edible, but for the dishonest pricing and for the jerk who apparently owns the place.My girlfriend Carol and I were walking through Scottsdale. It was just past noon on a recent Sunday so we were thinking about lunch. We passed Italian Grotto and saw a menu posted outside on the wall. The "lunch" part of the menu had most entrees at $8. "I'll treat you to lunch," she said. "Sounds good," said I.We went in and there were very few customers. Three or four people were sitting at the bar. We were seated quickly. The server, who was polite, brought us menus. The first thing we noticed was that there were no $8 items on it. All of the lunch items were priced at $13 or more. So we asked the server about the menu on the outside of the building. Here's what he said: "Yes, those are $8 items if you get them al la carte." Of course, al la carte suggests that you can get, say, the baked ravioli for $8 if you get nothing else on the side. But then the server added "But these items do come with either soup or salad." Hmmm? It clearly sounded like he was saying the lunch special was $8 and you still got a soup or salad. Carol and I looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. I ordered the baked ravioli, she ordered a vegetable pasta dish.(Each of these were $8 on the outside menu but $13 on the menu he handed us. He clearly intimated that we were ordering items as a "lunch special".) We also ordered  a side of garlic bread and one iced tea. That's all we ordered.As we awaited our meals, there was some person standing around the lobby and I heard him say something loudly about "Jews", which got my attention. He seemed drunk and a couple of the servers were standing around him so I thought "some idiot"...and tuned him out. (And remember, this was just after noon!)The food arrived and was fine. I got exactly four medium-sized ravioli on my plate, along with a salad. The drunk guy was quiet but still standing around the lobby like he owned the place. He looked a bit like Donald Trump, same age and attitude, and he wore a couple of rather large gold earrings in his left ear.After we ate, we got the check and were shocked to see that it totaled $40. Not only that, but the entrees were written down as $14 each. What kind of weird mistake was this? Carol, who doesn't mind confronting issues like this, had me wait at the table while she went to find the waiter.Then I heard the loud guy yapping at her. I did not hear what he was saying but it sounded, at a distance, like he was arguing with her. As my attention turned to him, my girlfriend laughed a couple of times and I thought that this guy must be the manager or owner. (Carol is from Long Island and is used to New York attitudes so I figured all was good.) This one-sided conversation lasted 5 minutes or so. Then she came back with the bill and rolled her eyes saying "Let's get outta here."As it turned out, the owner only deducted that extra two dollars from the bill (from $14 to $13 per entree) and, according to Carol, he reeked of alcohol and acted drunk. And obnoxious. He asked her to "Get a load of the queers at the bar!" And that was just the beginning of his tirade.She said that the owner wondered why I, the boyfriend, wasn't paying the bill and that "no woman should pay when a man can pay. I have six daughters and if they ever had to pay for a meal on a date, the boyfriends would never be welcome in the house!" Carol, thinking that the guy was just trying to act like a macho New Yorker, told him that she was from Long Island. In response he said "Long Island isn't New York! Only spoiled brats live on Long Island. I grew up in Manhattan, in Chelsea, on 29th and 9th!" He asked Carol why we were in Scottsdale. She said, "We live in Tucson and have been visiting Arcosanti." He said "Why would you live in Tucson? It's a dump! I had a bagel business on 1st Ave. in Tucson and it was a terrible place!" He also added, "I was at Arcosanti a few years ago and it was dirty and hippies lived there." I suppose this was the point in the conversation when Carol laughed and walked away.As we were walking back to our car and Carol was relating this story, we knew that this information needs to get out. And seeing what many others have written about this restaurant, I think you can see we aren't exaggerating. The owner of Italian Grotto is some drunken misanthrope named Gary Horowitz (so why his comment about Jews?!) and no one should be supporting his business.also see: http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2001-05-03/restaurants/veni-vici-vendetta/full/The owner of this restaurant is the rudest person I have ever encountered. He reacted aggressively toward us at a simple request to keep some food warm. We were all perfectly civil, reasonable customers and were treated MOST disrespectfully. The police were even involved when we wanted to leave in the middle of our meal. He succeeded in ruining our night and obtaining a large sum for food we did not eat because we were so offended by his behavior. I do not often wish I'll will upon another person. But this man is despicable and I hope you will not support this business. **the waiter Will was lovely, howeverLast night 6 of my girlfriends and I had dinner here. We had made reservations and were seated promptly. We were however seated next to the door and one of my girlfriends was shoved a few times by other customers because of it. We all shrugged it off and tried to enjoy our night.First off the 2 stars are for the food. The food was pretty amazing. I had the Chilean sea bass and it was divine. It was served on top of freshly made ravioli and it was incredible. Everyone else had very positive things to say about their dinner. For dessert we all shared 3 cannolis which tasted heavenly. So delicious.Here is where it takes a turn for the worse...Our bill arrived and we know that they don't do separate checks. Understandable. We were told we could split it up with our cards as long as we told them how much to charge. Fast forward 2 minutes...as I'm simply writing down how much to charge on each card, a older looking balding man approaches our table and starts mumbling about needing our table and that we have been taking too long. Are you kidding me? From start to end we were there a MAXIMUM of 1 hour, a party of 7 mind you! He then proceeds to come back and again states that we are taking forever with the cards and what is it going to take to get us out of there. I understand that it's a Saturday night, but the manner in which he addressed us was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. It was flat out rude and demeaning. At first I thought maybe he was just having a bad night and whatnot but after reading other reviews I know that is just his "wonderful" personality. I would love to come back for the food but am not going to support a business that is spearheaded by such a jerk.On the disappointment scale, Italian Grotto ranks right up there with my never getting laid by my first girlfriend, whom I now know twenty years later is a lesbian.Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara. The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat.The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown.This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it? I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving.I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes.Another huge disappointment.It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce.I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off. I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally!I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at $12.95.The only thing good about this place was nothing. I suspect they've remained in business all these years primarily due to their location, and all the unknowing tourists.Never going back.My husband and I had a nice dinner outside however when I went to use the bathroom the owner stopped me  and told me I had  90 seconds to use the bathroom. He had two girls bang in the door. I told him he owed me a apology and he called me a nasty name. He was very rude and I would never go back. I would have called the police but I was visiting my very ill brother. Please don't go here. He should be shut down. We spent 60 dollars and this is how he treats his customers. I hope this post stops people from eating there and he shuts down.This place made my stomach flip! The owner was rude and assumed that we did not speak English because our skin was brown. I have never felt more offended in my life.  And then he acted like he was giving us complimentary glasses of wine and appetizers to redeem himself as a "New Yorker" and charges us    The place is way overpriced and nothing special.  Move on now !!!! We had an app and a glass of overpriced wine and decided to leave because of the offensiveness.   Disgusted by what an owner representsInsulting, dishonest and bottom line an absolute joke! We made reservations over a month ago, arrived and waited over 40 minutes but that wasn't the problem, the problem was the inebriated owner!  He continued to seat people without reservations and when we graciously asked about how much longer it would be he made a huge scene. He offered to buy us drinks, started yelling and the restaurant got to witness his unruly/unprofessional behavior.  He yelled that since "your always on your phone all day so why don't you write a review, I won't care I'll be busy anyway", well Mr.  I'm a writing a review and I hope your restaurant is empty forever more!We had a mediocre dinner tonight. I have been here before but after tonight, we won't be returning. The salad was just OK. Lettuce with a ton of blue cheese dressing that tasted like sour cream. The entree of halibut was good. The waiter apparently didn't like the tip our host gave him. He came back and asked if the service was OK. Then whispered something rude in our host's ear. As we were exiting the table made a big deal of saying "You can't believe this table" to one of his coworkers. Then followed my 84 year old Mom and I and told us he only got a 10% tip. Tips are DISCRETIONARY for one thing and we had no control over that. Classless! If you want real Italian food served by polite people in a relaxed atmosphere, go to Tommy V's and forget this place.******ATROCIOUS, DISRESPECTFUL, INSANE, MENTALLY UNSTABLE AND HIGH ON WEED FATHER SON DUO.....STAY AWAY***** First off, the owner let in people who came way after my family and me. The only reason was because he seemed to be more friendly with them than his other customers. We ordered and the service was OK as to what happened afterwards. My daughters "vegetarian" soup had pork in it which we don't eat. We told the owner and were expecting a nice apology. NO. What we got was WAY worse. He started lecturing us about how no ones perfect! I didn't come here to get a lesson! I came here for a peaceful friendly dinner for my father in law's birthday. I have to make this short (it's too long to write) at the end his demon son ended up kicking us out even though we were already leaving!! He tried to make it seem like we were being kicked out! Unbelievable DONT GO HERE!!! THE OWNER YELLS EVEN AT CHILDREN!I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but if you are ever planning on being within a 100 mile radius of this place, I would recommend that you read it. It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a "vegetarian" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. "Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!" All I wanted was a simple "S-O-R-R-Y." Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed "Excuse me!" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. "Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say "I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? " I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked "Is everyone leaving here?" We said yes and continued to leave. "I don't like being insulted like that," my father told him. "Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! "You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!" Now, my father was mad. "I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with "A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. "Just don't end up in the ER!" my father said. I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I seriously hope this place burns down. It would make the world a much better place.The food is terrible and the service is even worse. Never have I been treated so badly by an owner of a restaurant. He treats his staff just as poorly. He should be ashamed and embarrassed. Such a low life that he went through the garbage for used cigarettes to smoke.This place honestly doesn't understand the concept of service. After being ignored and disrespected by our server we got up to leave, upon seeing the owner on leaving wanted to let him know about WHAT A HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE HE HAS, he continued to tell us we were NOT respected, too young to have an opinion (mind you my friend speaking is 29). Nice try bro, we have corporate credit cards, you messed up with your age profiling. missed out on an unlimited budget *tisk *tisk doucheI have been having an internal debate for a few weeks now about how detailed of a review I wanted to write. I have decided that although I am not excited about wasting more of my time on this horrible establishment, but if I can keep them from making money off of at least one unsuspecting patron, I have succeeded. I will keep it relatively brief because my experience was not much different than most of the other one star experiences complete with rudeness and threats.We were hanging out in Old Town one evening after spring training and decided to stop in. We walked up to the host stand and a line quickly started forming behind us. As my friend and I were wondering where the host was, the gentleman behind us (from another party) informed us that they never have a host and we should beware because when someone does show up, they will be very rude. Weird, we though. I asked his why he still came and he told me, "for the food." "Well whatever" we thought. We shall see for ourselves. He was right about the rude part. We never made it to the food part and I don't care because my hard earned dollars won't go to support such an awful family (it is apparently a family owned business).The owner eventually stumbles up with his glass of wine. My friend says "excuse me, we have a party of 3," to which he replies smugly, "yeah I see that..." Shortly thereafter, a server walks by and as we try to get his attention, he purposely ignores us.Um ok.Next, a server comes up to use the credit card machine. My friend says, "excuse me but we have not been helped yet, is there a host?" To which he replies, "look, if you were sitting in my section, I would help you out, but you aren't, you are here. So you aren't my problem." Charming.Rinse and repeat with a third prince charming who says, "whaddya want me to do, it's busy, etc. etc. [insert a few more obnoxious comments here]"So now that my friend has been treated disrespectfully 3 times, I'm pretty irate and grace our resident jerk with a few choice words of my own. (hey, I'm not proud of it but well.....he deserved it). He looked shocked at a lady standing up for herself and wouldn't you know the big man threatens to call the police. I asked him to please do so (loudly and with an obscenity), but he declined. At first I thought that this was rudeness combined with an utter lack of respect for women. I do think that is true, but it goes further, as it does not seem that they have respect for any of their customers. However, if you can read all of these reviews of behavior that would be unbelievable if it weren't for the sheer QUANTITY of similar reviews, and still donate your cash, I would not respect you either.I wish it was possible to give this place negative stars. Please avoid it at all costs and save your hard earned money and go to a decent restaurant. This place was filthy, food was below mediocre and overpriced, and worst of all, disrespectful owner with too much of an attitude. How can you get away with charging 21 dollars for a chicken caesar salad that seemed to be made with leftover chicken scraps, bagged lettuce, no croutons, and of the size of a side salad? I am a seasoned cook and foodie and eat out often, and by no means this is acceptable anywhere. Even when I used to live in NYC they would never get away with charging that, and if so, it would be in a top notch restaurant in the city. The worst part was when my boyfriend's mom nicely requested a tad more cheese for her pasta and the owner almost dumped the whole cheese bowl in her plate! By no means should customers by treated in this manner. He was even eavesdropping our conversation and gave his input in regards to the subject. What kind of person in his/her right mind does this? In all, you are warned! Please don't come to this establishment.
Kazimierz World Wine Bar=Likely the best wine bar in old-town. This place has a stellar reputation with locals. My one and only gripe is how busy it is - which makes finding a seat rather difficult.Nice and dark with a wine list that will blow your socks off, and potentially your hard earned dollars too...The crowd is well mixed, slightly older and more sophisticated. A great place to meet up with friends and chill.So I try to impress my girlfriend and tell her that I know of the cool wine bar in Old Town.  I write down the addy since it's been a year or so since I've been here, and then guess what? I loose the paper, oops. We end up walking around for a while and then finally finding it. ---For the few people who haven't been here yet, there is no street front door, and there is only a small sign over the backdoor that says "The truth is inside".---Service is great.  Tried the Egyptian flat bread with morels, brie, shallots and truffle oil. Hell ya.  Now the wine, I'll be the first to admit I'm a winetard, but I'm learning. So at this stage of the game I like the wine flights. 3 3oz samples of a similar wines.  That makes it a bit easier to figure out what the next glass would be.Once you find this place it's great. I found it several years ago, I just forgot where it was.Every Thursday night there's a live jazz ensemble. The singer, after paying a cover charge to hear him sing, will try to seduce your lady. The waitress will remember you every time from the one night you spent with her friend that blew you off because of her bf. Remember that night at BS West? But it's dark so you don't recognize her. And you'll ask if they have a full bar because it's dark and you can't see, but they do... And you'll wander into the cave in the back corner but it's reserved for a private party. Maybe you're a part of it. And the same friend will ask you to buy her a drink, like she does everywhere you see her. And you'll feel used and remind yourself to avoid her.I thought I would update my previous vague review.  I've been a few times now, a couple times with friends and once on a date. It's always been a great time.  Reasons this place will make you happy:-It's dark, so you will probably look better than you normally do. You know low lighting is flattering, don't deny it. It's also highly romantic.-Free shot on your birthday. I took my best friend here on her birthday and the bartender made her a beautiful complimentary shot with a sugared lime on top.  -Wine flights. Do it. You will not be disappointed. I recently partook in a wine flight and one of the offerings tasted exactly like cheese. No joke, every sip of the wine tasted like I was nibbling on cheese. That may sound bad to some of you, but I enjoyed it.  -The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They always steer me towards great wine. Unfortunately, I never remember what that great wine was the next day.-The cheese plates are amazing. Mmmmm, sharp cheddar.The only things not to love are the lines that tend to form for the bathroom, the numerous reserved tables, and the hole that is burned into my wallet.Based on the recommendations from a few local Yelpers, I decided to stop by this joint to have a few drinks.  The entrance to this bar/lounge is in the rear of the building....that was hilarious because I walked by at least 2 or 3 times hearing music and trying to figure out how the hell to get in, until I saw the sign that read "Like All Good Speakeasys The Entrance Is Hidden In The Rear"....ha!Upon entering the bar/lounge, I knew I would love this place....why?- It's dark....I love dark bars, hate it when there's too much light....that's the Vampire side of me coming out.- The bartender was very cool & knowledgable....when I asked him if he had an IPA on tap, he suggested the Bells Two Hearted Ale IPA and proceeded to tell me about the different flavors I could expect.  Then he stopped by to check and see if he was right and if not, I could get something else.....awesome.- They had a band playing, but I arrived after they just finished their set...so I don't know what they were playing.....but I love small live music joints.- The lounge area has plush sofas and chairs to hang out with your friends.  I wish I wasn't solo....it would have been nice to sit there with The Better Half and a few friends.What a great recommendation by fellow Yelpers from Scottsdale/Phoenix....thanks!Will I return?  You bet!There's dining in the dark, and then there's wining in the dark. Yes, it's so dark in here that you won't want to bother trying to read their bible of a wine list - just ask your server for some recommendations. And because it's so dimly lit in here, it's a great spot for getting cozy and romantical with that someone special. The space is quite hidden, but once you make your way inside, you'll find a pretty huge space. There is tons of seating, so it's also a nice wine bar for gathering with friends. There's live music or a DJ on a nightly basis, so you not only get wonderful wines here, but a fun atmosphere. It's one of those places that you can spend hours on end at, but mix it up and have a nice dinner before or after at their sister spot around the corner, Cowboy Ciao. Makes for a perfect date night!Try their Boom Boom Syrah and get a mix of cheeses and meats to nibble on. Great thing is that you don't have to worry about having purple teeth or food on your face. Your date won't be able to notice it at all!The night is hot and sticky. The streets of old town have an eerily abandoned feeling as we realize it's 9pm on a Friday night and we are the only pedestrians around. Even in a sundress and sandals, I feel my skin glow with perspiration. After a bit of wandering, we realize we might be lost when I see a corridor lined with vines and trellises and my intuition and sense of adventure tells me to follow it. I grab his hand and lead the way blindly. He begins questioning my decision when I see a mysterious wooden door and before he can finish objecting we realize we found our way to the truth within. We step inside and it feels like we found the closet that leads to Narnia. We walk into another world. Another time. Relaxed sounds of jazz caress our ears as our eyes adjust to the darkness and candlelight. We take in the old world feel, the stone, the wood, the beautiful sleek bar...that seems to be beckoning us to sit. Couples and groups of friends absorbed in each other on cushy couches and stools all with a sense of privacy and feeling that there is no world outside of this place and there is no moment other than now. His eyes meet mine and we know this is exactly where we want to be.As we settle in at the bar, helpful suggestions are ready when we ask. He orders for me, as only seems appropriate in this mysterious and romantic era. Pinot Noir, Cabernet, plates of pâté, soppressata, brie, stilton white with cherries. I can taste the pure indulgence dripping off the mere words as they leave his mouth. The wine flows and the food is plentiful. Every sip, every bite, is something to savor and worthy of noting. Our conversation, whispers of love and beauty in each other's ears, lips close enough for a kiss. Knowledge of another world, remembrances of anyone else is lost as we fall under the spell that is Kazimierz. When the night is over and we have no choice but to go back to where we came from, we reluctantly step back out into the warm, heavy night air greeted by sounds of traffic and rickshaw drivers ringing their bells. But as we leave, we take with us a secret. A sexy, decadent, mysterious secret that lies behind an old wooden door in the heart of old town. The only way to discover that secret is to seek out that door and enter it yourself.I knew where this place was. I did. But when walking down the incredibly stinky alley towards the back, I started to question myself. It wasn't what I wanted. It wasn't what I expected. But it was kind of cool. The door man takes his role seriously. I like it, and he lets me in. I escort my date like a gentleman and we take seats by the bar to get an overlook. Live music is about to start. The bar personnel isn't to chatty but friendly. The prices are a little higher, but for the ambiance I feel they should be. They even have a few simple rules that could be classified as a dress code. Don't wear your hat backwards. I like it. Only kids get away with that, and this sure is no place for kids.Another rule is to adhere to the speakeasy - don't cuss, don't yell. I just love it. We ate a little; we drank a little and embraced the milieu with our fellow patrons. This place is a gem, in its dark shadowy appearance. I wouldn't want to change a thing. - IF you are into wine and feel you have the capacity to soak in the atmosphere - Go!- IF you feel that nobody should tell how to act - Don't go! - IF you like to people watch and/or listen to some live music that fits the venue better than your personality - Go!- IF you aren't sure what the front of your ball cap is, but you will not conform to the designed intent - Don't go!- IF you can't determine the proper volume of your voice, or control your flavoring of your language with the salty words that of a sailor - Seek help!This is the perfect place to conclude your evening in Scottsdale. After you have dinner at FnB (you did go to FnB didn't you?) you can just take a short walk to Kazimierz. FYI, the sign that says, "Like all good speakeasies, the entrance is hidden in the rear" isn't a joke - you enter at the rear of the building.It's a very relaxing environment. Comfortable seating (you can reserve a couch but I think there's a $ minimum) and there is live music every night.  They do serve food but the whole point of a wine bar is to drink some wine. I dare you to ask for a wine they don't have - their 75 page wine list has over 2,000 wines ranging in price from $10 to $10,000 (no, that wasn't a typo).  The wine list is actually sorted by price which is a nice touch. Unless you're planning on spending an hour or so looking over the wine list I suggest you look at it on their website before visiting.  Another option is to ask for the "Nifty Fifty" list - it has their most popular 50 wines.Go...sit back...relax...enjoy some good music and some wine.Back door entrance. Prohibition feel. Interior as far as the walls, are obviously artificial. Overall still provides an enjoyable atmosphere.  The best part:  The live band gets an A+++++!  Current music with their own style.  Definitely had me singing along to songs I don't normally like. The menu has great options and is affordable. Had some wine by the glass served in a personal carafe.  The truffle Gouda tastes so good. It is served on a platter with bread, apples, dried apricot, and nuts. Difficult to converse with friends during the band performance. I prefer to sit back snack and absorb the music.
The Blue Moose=Sooo, I'm a fan of The Blue Moose... not necessarily a sports fan, though. Lol. Although the day I went there to meet some friends, there was a football game on (and forgive me if I piss off all the die-hard sports fanatics out there; not my intention), and when the blue team scored (yes, this is the extent of my sports knowledge), they gave the whole bar free blue jello shots! Awesomeness!!! I did notice, however, how united everyone was at The Blue Moose -- it was like you walked into a friend's Superbowl party -- it felt like everyone there was family, which was pretty darn awesome in itself.
Los Molcajetes=This place is definitely worth the trip! Molcajetes are their specialty, and it shows. "Molcajete" is Mexican Spanish for mortar, as in mortar & pestle. These are quite a bit larger than your usual kitchen mortar and made of volcanic rock. If you order one, your food is cooked and served in the mortar, and the sauce is still bubbling like lava when it comes to your table.The two of us couldn't decide exactly what we wanted in our shared molcajete (and damn, were we glad we shared one, they're enormous!), so we got the combination one that has beef, chicken, and shrimp, along with the usual lime wedge, cactus strips, radish slices, avocado slice, large slice of tomato, and amazing red sauce, served with either flour or corn tortillas (we chose corn; they were soft, white corn tortillas, and very tasty). That alone could have fed three people, so needless to say we didn't try anything else while we were there, save for the chips & salsa they give you in the beginning. That salsa was also super tasty!We were completely entertained the whole time watching Univision on the few mounted flat-screen TVs. Well, one of them was playing all music videos, and the other two were tuned to Univision. During most of our stay, a telenovela was on. This might not be as amusing to those who don't speak or read Spanish, but then again, I think they're pretty entertaining regardless.Previous reviews have noted that Los Molcajetes has separate English & Spanish menus and that they don't accept cards. Perhaps they've recently changed these things, because the menus we were given were bilingual, and there's a sign in Spanish in the back of the room that says they accept both credit and debit cards but charge $1 for the service.I also saw at least one previous reviewer who noted feeling like "idiot gringos" or something to that effect because they stood around waiting for someone to assist them when they walked in. When we entered, there was a sign just inside the door that said "Sientense donde gusten," which translates as "Seat yourselves wherever you'd like," and that's what we did. So, gringos, if you see this sign, pretend it says "Please seat yourselves" and act accordingly. ;) Be aware that if you do so, however, the very friendly waitress may think you speak Spanish and start out speaking to you in Spanish when she comes to your table, like she did with us. Both of us do understand and speak decent Spanish, but the waitress quickly realized that our main language was English, so she accommodated. Don't be scurrred, is what I'm sayin'.Yes, as mentioned by others, there are vendors (of CDs, beaded jewelry, etc.) and musicians who wander in & out of the place and will come by your table to see if you're interested in what they're selling. A simple "no thank you" and a smile is enough to get them to quietly move on; no one tried to hard-sell us or was particularly bothersome. I've noticed several (probably American) reviewers remark about this aspect of the restaurant negatively, and some have even knocked a star or two off for it. This phenomenon of wandering vendors is actually quite commonplace in restaurants throughout Latin America in all but the fanciest of places, and anyone who's travelled around a bit likely knows this and won't be aggravated by it.
Frasher's Steak House & Lounge=This place has fantastic food at reasonable prices, incredibly friendly and attentive service, and a great atmosphere that lies somewhere between comfy cozy casual to romantic and classy. So why the hell is this place so empty??I'm sure it has some busy nights, but when I've gone there's hardly anyone in there. Perhaps it's just a well-kept secret. Or maybe people just forget it's there. Or it could be just that I've only gone there on off hours.I do have a few ideas actually - and this could explain the 4 star reviews instead of 5. The food is very rich and the portions are huge. It's almost old fashioned cuisine. Everything I've had has been awesome, but I think they could get a little more modern with some of their dishes... although they do offer some good contemporary or at least unique stuff.It's also pretty dark in there - I would definitely bring dates here (if I was single) for the intimacy, but not everyone likes to eat in such a dark restaurant. This is also a little old-school. I guess that's it - that's the only thing I can find fault with here. Otherwise, it's got a cool patio and a great bar, the kitchen is open until midnight and it's just an all-around solid place to hang out.Okay - I've been going here fairly regularly and I've upgraded this to a 5 star place. The food is awesome and the people here are rad. It's one of my new favorites. I don't know what I was thinking giving it a 4. I'm stupid.This place ranges from quite busy to comfortably laid back as it turns out. It's always an easy place to go though. As for the pronunciation, I used to say it like "Frasier's" instead of like it's spelled and then for some reason started saying it like it's spelled for the last few months. Tonight I asked the owner and he confirmed it was pronounced like Frasier's. I feel stupid yet again, but at least I've been sending people there.The first time I ate here was when my in-laws visited two years ago.  I had the teriyaki glazed salmon, and found it to be just okay.  The garlic mashed potatoes are whipped so I didn't really enjoy that either.After the food situation at ZooBrew was a bust, Dottsy Z and I with our plus ones zipped over here for dinner on Friday evening.  First off, we had excellent service, and there was free live soft porn for entertainment.  Stay tuned for Dottsy's review--she had the best view of the "action."  We started off with the toasted ravioli with meat.  I didn't think it was great, but I would have preferred the cheese.  My husband had a steak which he said was very good.  I went with the smoked salmon appetizer for a light dinner.  "Light dinner."  There are two words that usually aren't next to each other in my vocabulary.  With the salmon was warm pita, a horseradish mousse, and capers.  I couldn't detect the horseradish which was fine with me.  The plate was a nice combination of flavors.  A little green apple or cheese might be a nice addition, but I enjoyed it.I might have bumped Frasher's to four stars had Dottsy's plus one not found a piece of plastic in his sandwich (supposedly from the turkey).  As it is, I still can't say that I'm a fan.
Grandma's Kitchen=My grandma loved me.This grandma only offered me . . . . margarine?  Really?  In today's day and age and grandma has no butter?  Its not just about science here, its about taste.  Unfortunately grandma didn't have that either.The hash-browns were flavorless.  The ham was only cooked on one side.  The french toast had a form of cinnamon in it but it still lacked in flavor, explain to me how that is possible?  I'm still perplexed.  The maple syrup was a far, distant step cousin to anything maple.  The coffee, a measure in any restaurant, was miserably lacking.We went to Grandma's Kitchen based on the two reviews here on Yelp and I was sadly, sadly misled.  :(My grandmothers weren't this rude and their cooking was INFINITELY better-tasting.  Don't waste the trip.  I ordered eggs that had absolutely no taste to them.  The waitress went out of her way to be rude to me and other guests there.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service (I think they are mentally ill) and very bad food.Was looking for a breakfast place so we decided to stop at Grandma's Kitchen.. The atmosphere was so-so, they should have had music on or something! The waitress wasn't mean or rude, just kinda surly. I ordered the bacon, spinach and mushroom omelette, minus the 'shrooms. When I got the omelette I noticed the spinach didn't look very fresh, and upon first bite I could taste it: CANNED SPINACH!! Ew. I'm assuming the mushrooms would have been canned too, glad I left them off..
Medizona=When I hit a quarter of a century in years, I decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango. Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.Now I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.Cha, cha, cha.MEDIZONA.It even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.An upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?Intriguing.Rabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?Wicked fricken good.It puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.Wild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?Melt in my mouth delicious.Try to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans "haricot verts." Merde!Roast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?Eh. The lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.The service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. The customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.But then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.So I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off. No need to return.
Harold's Corral=It's 9pm on a wednesday night, I just landed from San Francisco and I hadn't slept the night before.I need sustenance.Prime rib for $11.99? Sure why not.I just wish I had fresh horseradish. Also, a little more attention from the waitress would've been nice. The place was EMPTY.The prime rib was annihilated.Harold's is worth the drive up north if you're looking for a good 'ol country / biker bar to drink beer, listen to country music, and/or watch Steelers games... It's a huge space with several rooms inside and a great big outdoor patio too.  Up until my most recent visit, I might have told you that the service and food were pretty consistent too... but unfortunately, both the service and food sucked during our last visit!Since I've been going to Harold's for years though, I'm sticking to a 3 star review in hopes that our last experience was a fluke. In the past, I've enjoyed both the beef ribs and the salmon entrees at Harold's.  I went for a steak salad last visit and was extremely disappointed - it was pretty nasty. I also found it funny that when my bf asked about the soup of the day, the waitress said it was 'clam chowder' and that it was 'good when fresh' but she didn't recommend it the day we were there... huh, that kinda makes you wonder?!Harold's does offer steamed broccoli as well as plenty of other side items including french fries, coleslaw, baked potato, and more.  Their menu is huge with something for everyone, but I think Nadia C has the right idea in going to Harold's for beer and burgers!It's a shame my experience sucked, but to be honest we didn't come during any events at the restaurant, and we came in a large group. Also I didn't choose to eat here; we were here for a celebration.No one sat us; we arranged tables ourselves outside. A waiter eventually came 10 minutes later to get our drink orders.Prices for the food are too high, especially since the quality is bad. I had the BBQ burger, and there was a dot of barbecue sauce imprinted in the bun, none on the burger. The sauteed onions sat in a pool of grease on top of the burger. The sweet potato waffle fries ($2 extra) were soaked in oil, so bad that it took 2-3 napkins just to soak up some of the grease off of one piece. I ate the burger because I was very hungry, but it wasn't any good. My friend ordered chicken fingers, and for $8 she got 4 measly-looking pieces. I don't know where all the good reviews are coming from. Maybe they have good bands play or good drinks that I don't know about; but the food is absolutely terrible.
Sister's Oriental Market & Video=My Lao daughter and my not-Lao-but-knows-Lao-sista and I are going to lunch! My sista says this is her favorite Lao place to eat. I'm SO in. Did someone say PAPAYA SALAD?! So I met them up. Sista had already ordered her tripe soup. I'm not into tripe but I tried the broth and it was tasty. My Lao daughter got the kao biek! It was SO good! She doesn't like veggies so there wasn't any cilantro or green onions in it but the broth was delish and the noodles were nommy too. I put in an order for Nam and Papaya Salad... Is it Lao style? Yes. Do I want crab in it? No thanks. I ordered Medium spice... However she interpreted that, it came out nice and spicy! Made my nose run and crave for more! The papaya salad it served with cabbage on the side - if you want pork rinds, you're in a Lao store and can buy a package. I should have! There are also pieces of that green bean in the papaya salad.. Matua.. However you spell it - it's delish! The Nam came out with cilantro and lettuce leaves on the side and the nam itself was topped with crispy red peppers. Make my nose drip some more! I'm eatin' good! There are little slivers of I think ginger in the Nam too which I dodnt care for much just cuz you know when you get a mouthful of ginger it is rather overpowering and unpleasant. For me anyway.They have quite a bit more food here than your typical Lao store where you can just order a few things or there are some items in the fridge that were previously made. I like it! I will definitely be back to try the Larb Gai and get some more Kao biek. And papaya salad. And nam... =) And some nice man thought my sista was SO fione he bought our lunch! Score! Shoutout to Mike and his mama, Dao! Mike your mom was super nice and knows my Lao sista too! =)))
Oak's Diner & Flapjacks=Yay!  Another place to add to the breakfast rotation!  With the BF residing in North Phoenix, there are not that many options when it comes to finding a good breakfast spot in the area.  So, when we were craving a hearty meal last Sunday morning, we went on a mission (to Cave Creek) to find somewhere new to add to our existing rotation of Kashman's, The Good Egg, The General Store, and Einstein's Bagels.  We found it at Oak's!  Unfortunately, we aren't the only ones that found it...The place was packed when we walked in, but it was the kind of packed where it's a good sign!  It was warm and cozy with a positive energy in the air.  We put our name on the list and the hostess brought us both coffee.  Jared, being the aggressive guy he is, found us two seats at what Oak's considers their bar (I think), so we ended sitting there instead of waiting for a table.  Ice waters arrived immediately and the menu had all kinds of eggs, pancakes, waffles, French toast, and more.  I ordered the harvest (wheat) pancakes along with an egg white omelet - yes, they have egg whites too!  Jared went with the French toast and ate my hash browns.  Everything was served with melt in your mouth butter and syrup.  We cleaned our plates, it was that good!Needless to say, we've agreed to add Oak's to the breakfast rotation.  If you don't mind the trek to Cave Creek, go check it out for yourself.  With a huge menu of items to choose from, there is something for everyone... kid friendly too!
Las Vegas Jerkys=Aunties Karen and Sandy own and run this Las Vegas Jerkys shop.  It's located inside the Las Vegas Club Hotel (head towards the back of the casino).  They do a WONDERFUL job with customer service.  Their products are excellent.  What I like best about this place (besides the wonderful customer service) is that many of their products have recipes that are rooted from the Islands.  That, coupled with the local friendly customer service, equals a WINNER!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#ykPNkbsRAqmW0dgFsMioBgThere are literally 50-75 types of beef & pork jerkys to purchase here.  There are also wonderful candies, cookies, chips, lup chong, chocolates, etc. to purchase here.  I got so excited here, I literally spent $350 on goodies for my visiting relatives and items to bring back to Honolulu when I go back home.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#qeyJ6o2dDKlmwlbBLduvcQTop of the list is the Islander Brand Lup Chong (Chinese Sausage).  These are traditional Chinese sausages that were originally crafted in Honolulu, and produced in Los Angeles, CA.  The owners purchased the rights to the recipe and produce the sausages for the store.  These sausages are thick and a bit on the sweet side.  Wonderful for fried rice, baked salmon with lup chong, or just eating along with steamed rice.  OMGDELICIOUS!  Get it!  Grade:  A+http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#_GPmeVlAXT4xVMjgka_R_Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#TT763Urq_CmdhbRuxch5WwIslander Brand Beef Jerkey is another favorite.  Comes in plain, spicy, peppered, pork, and spicy pork.  This is your traditional beef jerkey, but the flavors are out of this word.  Grade:  A-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#cEO3s2d_3MfdlDuvY29jsgIslander Brand Sweet Dried Pork.  Aunty Karen calls this the jerky that taste like char siu.  These pork slices are cured and dried, and actually taste like you are eating sweet char siu (Chinese red roast pork).  The flavor is delicious, but the texture is a bit on the tough side.  Delicious, nonetheless.  Grade:  B+Karen's Bagel Chips.  DELICIOUS!!!   Aunty Karen makes bagel chips that come in a variety of flavors - cinnamon sugar, blueberry, cranberry, plain, etc.  The most popular flavor is the cinnamon.  The bagel chips come in a container and must be hand-carried if you are traveling.  Fun to eat, flavorful, and crunchy!  Grade:  Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-jerkys-las-vegas?select=7Z2FHsyO9iv4FtD4clSIsQ#aSXHyjkj03UU7dMOXyFiSQWhat I liked best about the store was that it was like shopping at home in Hawaii.  Both Aunty Karen and Sandy were super helpful in helping me put my order together and to make suggestions on what to purchase.  They were so much like family, they threw in a free apron and gave my family keiki toy cars when we were leaving!   AMAZING!   Mahalos, aunties!Product Grade:  A-Service Grade:  A+Worth the money grade:  A-Overall Impression Grade:  A!
Grimaldi's Pizzeria=At about 7 pm we arrive... a bunch of pilots, flight attendants and mechanics/maintenance ... about 14... they were able to seat us with in 10 minutes... i was stoked!!we are all seated outside... it was such a beautiful night last night... it was soo nice! the waiter comes up... and says hi... but WE had to ASK him his name... and he was way to relaxed... not very outgoing at all... he gave me the feeling like we interrupted his "Smoke" break.... my bad while we were waiting for our food i asked for some bread... they brought out a little plate of maybe 8-10 pieces of bread on it... keep in mind we all have not eaten since before noon that day... and we all looked at the plate like um.... o...k... when the food FINALLY came i was soo excited... the whole place had smelled amazing since walking up from the parking lot!! (which was kinda small and packed) but i was quickly disappointed... the pizza was soo thin... the toppings fell right off the pizza.. and there was virtually no sauce at all!! :( the crust was the best part of the whole thing... my friend and i decided to get a piece of cheesecake to hopefully save the meal... NOPE... not even close... i almost wanted to cry... cheesecake is my all time most favorite dessert and it was ruined! the crust was waxy and just gross... the cake part tasted a little weird... kinda like the crust and to mushy.. like they didn't give it enough time to set.. it was awful... their menu has salad appetizers, pizza and calzones... and desert.. that's it... no pastas or anything else so there isn't much to choose from... :( their water with lemon was my favorite part of the meal.. sad.. Over all..... The bathrooms were decent.. Parking was not to great..The food Sucked.... Service could have been WAY better.... and it was WAY OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!!! if i ever go back... I'm just gonna order Water with extra lemon...Great pizza, albeit a little overpriced.  They are a little stingy where they charge full price even if you get the toppings on half of the pizza.  Whatever, they make a damn good pizza. With that perfectly crisped thin crust and good portion of toppings.The service is a little slow, and the pizza does a take a bit, but it is all worth it.  Also a good place to cougar watch, for some reason they love this place!We ordered a pizza and a Caesar Salad with chicken "to go" tonight, and I'm giving a generous update with three stars... It's been a year and a half since my last review, and I have to say, Grimaldi's - I'm not as much a fan as I was back then.The pizza was half cooked and only tasted decent when we put it in the oven for another 10 minutes and covered it with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.  The chicken in the Caesar Salad that was supposed to be grilled was not - it looked like completely processed meat that was served luke warm; it was so gross looking that I didn't even taste it.  I'll stick with the original review in saying that Grimaldi's (especially the Old Town location) is a decent place to go if you've got a large group... but it's nothing so special with a smaller group or for take-out.  I won't be rushing back!If I could give this 4.5 I would.  Grimaldis is pretty damn awesome.  Its the best pizza you can get outside of NY and I have been to many of them.  This one was almost as good as the others except for a few things.We went to eat in when we first got into town on Thursday.  We were the only people in there for about 15 minutes.  We placed our order but it took forever.  The manager came by and apologized and even said there would be a little discount on the bill.  We ordered our usual, large pepperoni and garlic pizza and we shared a small Mediterranean salad.The salad came out pretty quick and it was tasty as usual.  The pizza finally came out and you know what?  It was a tad greasy.  Like greasy on the bottom.  I have never experienced that at any of the Grimaldis I have been to before.  The pizza tasted damn fine but somehow not as good as the NY/Las Vegas/Other Scottsdale locations.  We finished up our meal and they brought over the check.  There was no discount on it like the manager had said there would be.  I hate complaining so I didn't even say anything, but thats kind of messed up that they tell you there will be a discount for the long wait and then it never happens.  Semi weak sauce!We ordered pickup 2 other nights we were there and that went smooth.  One night I had to go in and pick up my pizza from the bar.  The other evening, you just had to pull up out back and they brought it out to you which was nice.Overall its still the best pizza you can get out here in the West.  The sauce, fresh mozzarella and thin crust cannot be beat.  Awesome pizza and thanks to the stupid EPA and coal ovens, we cant get one out here in CA.  Its a damn shame.  If Arnold would taste one of these pizzas, I bet he wouldn't give a shit if a tad more pollution enters our airspace ;-).  Grimaldis pizza is amazing and well worth it!Came here again this past week.  Ordered a personal white pizza with cheese and a large pepperoni and garlic.  It was awesome!  Some of the best pizza ever!  It was better than last month when I came and that's why this is getting bumped up to 5 stars.  We got our stuff much quicker this time and our waitress and the manager were on top of everything.  A great meal before the Diamondbacks game.  Grimaldis pizza is simply the best!I really don't require a whole lot from a pizza (or a pizza joint, for that matter). You don't have to hand build yourself a big old brick oven, grind your own semolina wheat into flour, milk your own cows for the milk for the mozzarella and press your own olives into super duper virgin olive oil, to impress me.I don't need for to you to have been blessed by Oprah or Jerry or any of their friends.All I need is a well-made and high quality pie, friendly and comfortable surroundings, a glass or two of a nice cab or syrah and friendly service and smiling faces!That's really pretty simple (but then, I am a simple man with simple needs...almost humble, really...and noted far and wide for my humility and modesty...I guess I would say "renowned").But enough about me...let's talk pies!Grimaldi's has 'em and a ton of people seem to like 'em!Rightly so...they are terrific!The Beautiful Carin and I wandered down to Grimaldi's last evening for dinner...split a Caesar, had a pie and couple of glasses of syrah...sat in the back, near the kitchen and watched the chef's hand toss the pies and stoke the oven with coal...All dark wood, red accents and black and white checked table cloths...just the way a pizza joint should be!Time to share our weeks with each other and decide how we want our weekend to look...a lovely Friday evening ritual...what a great meal and a great way to slide into the weekend!Tasty pizza dough, savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want, all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven!For those of us who don't always like to be told what to do...we get to customize our pizza (and the wait staff doesn't look at you like you just pooped in your chair for having the temerity to attempt to have a pizza pie the way you want it, instead of the way the pizza pooh-bah thinks you should have it)...that's right...have it any way you want!And yes, they get busy at Grimaldi's and you might have to wait from time to time, but the pleasant people who work the front of the house go out of their way to make you feel welcome and wanted!* They give you pizza shaped pagers to let you know when they are ready for you, rather than telling you that you have to come find them every hour to find out if you are going be able to eat;* There are tons of things to do nearby (within easy walking distance) if there is a bit of a wait, as well as a terrific and reasonably priced full bar to enhance your appetite;* They give you reasonably accurate estimates of the wait time, so you can decide what you would like to do (as opposed to telling you the wait is "2 hours" and then telling you 4 hours later that they have run out of everything and they are done for the night...too bad for you)In other words, Grimaldi's operates as a good restaurant should, providing an excellent product and wonderful and friendly service at very reasonable price points!I understand that one's taste in pizza is subjective and "who's best" is the subject of nearly endless and tedious debate...I mean really tedious...I'm not going be the one to broker peace in our time in the never ending Pizza Wars.For me, Grimaldi's is a slice of contentment, satisfaction and relaxation...I don't care who wins the Pizza Wars, as long as I can get a Friday night pie every week or two at Grimaldi's!I'm a huge fan of Grimaldi's Pizza.  The Better Half and I stopped in here for dinner and we had a huge appetite.....which is dangerous in a Pizza joint for me.I ordered:Caprese Salad - $7Personal Sized Pizza ($9) with:Sundried Tomatoes - $4Red Peppers - $4Ricotta Cheese - $2Mushrooms - $2Jalapenos - $2http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=DZ7xu0LF2IIg2_dI1c_CrAThe Better Half ordered a personal sized Pizza ($9) with:Pepperoni - $2Mushrooms - $2Feta Cheese - $2Basil - $2http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=1PaOTe8Ys9uJUP3u4DjHiQYeah, all toppings are al la carte here....so it's not cheap.  The Pizza was awesome!  I enjoyed every bite.  The combination of the sweet taste of Sun Dried Tomatoes combined with the spicy kick of Jalapenos mixed in with Ricotta, Mushrooms, and Red Peppers hit the spot!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=l4mZAt7mXpslp4LqexFy5gThe Better Half enjoyed her Pizza too.  Since I'm on my no Meat diet, I took her word for it....as much as I was tempted to give it a try, I resisted....maybe next time.To wash it down, she had 2 glasses of Brazin Zinfandel $8 ea, I had 2 O'douls $4 ea.  All in, the dinner was $72 before tip.Overall, it was a nice dinner.  I finished my food, she took home 1/2 of her Pizza.Return Factor - 100%In an unlucky turn of events, I ended up having a grand experience with my new favorite, Grimaldi's. More of my reviews lately have began with me aimed for one place and ending up at another, and I'll start with "this one isn't any different." Maybe it's a trend, maybe it's indecisive decision making, or maybe it's just plain old coincidence. Mostly because I don't believe in fate; I'll go with coincidence, but for those of you who mystify the universe in a shroud of hocus pocus, wizardry, and magic then feel free to call it fate.While I make the claim of "My New Favorite" I'm not really comparing it to much outside of oreganos, humble pie, upper crust, and streets of new york. I've yet to visit bianco, cibo, and plenty other wild-west, pizza slingers round these parts.Earlier this week I planed my birthday lunch at Cibo in Downtown PHX. A calorie and carb packed, delicious birthday meal. Much to my dismay, a quick pre-lunch look at the Cibo menu (on their website), seemed to be lacking a certain sauce and cheese covered, carbo loaded delight. After a call in confirming this fear, a fast yelping finger pointed me to Grimaldi's in Scottsdale. It didn't hurt that they had also sent me a voucher for free birthday pizza; I guess my wife signed me up for their email list. :-)On Sunday afternoon; even though they were busily serving plenty of customers, there was no wait. I placed an order with the server for a manhattan while I checked out their menu. Regretfully I had to send my drink back, it tasted more like straight whiskey, and bottom shelf at that. I decided to go with the house red wine in stead; which was decent and chilled, a bit odd for a red, but it worked out well.We dined on a large meatball, ricotta pizza and a large mediterranean salad. The salad was huge, big enough for 3 people to share, and each end up with 2 portions. The pizza came out with a perfectly crisped crust, evenly distributed slices or meatball and ricotta, and was delicious!We finished off our meal sharing a blueberry cheese cake AND a canolie, it was my birthday after all. I cant say that I've had many canolies in my life, but if they're all this good, there will be an eternal place in my heart set aside for these delectible deserts.Happy dining friends, and godspeed to all your yelping fingers!My rating is based on the dessert, because it's the most important meal of the day ;)First the food info. I didn't have pizza, I had house salad (bland, not great), green olives (not pitted!!! My teeth would have appreciated a heads up), the bruschetta (I was about an hour late to the party and they were mush by then), the cheesecake (sweet heaven!), cannoli (I thought they were okay, but those with me were in love). I have never been a cheesecake fan, but this place changed that :D It was soft & sweet and just amazing. I'm told that they change their cheesecake selection based on the seasons (that confused me because we only really have 2 in Az, lol). I can't wait for the strawberry cheesecake in the summer!!!They have a small parking lot behind the pizzeria building, but there's plenty of street parking.You know, the sign of really good pizza is how long the leftovers last in your frig.  For me, a Grimaldi's sausage and pepperoni has never last more than twelve hours.  I know.  It stinks.  I keep promising myself as the server is boxing up the remains of our dinner, I'll have this for lunch tomorrow, it will be so good.These leftovers never make it to lunch the next day.Sometimes I wake up at two a.m..  There will be that familiar craving - ok, I'll just go grab one slice, and leave the rest for lunch.  Back to bed.Up again at five a.m.  Time to get ready for work.  man, I'm hungry.  Scarf.  No more lunch pizza.  Make bologna sandwich for lunch.Service has always been spot-on, I can honestly say I have never had bad service at this store, and I've been going for years.  My Peroni is always refilled, the food is always perfectly done, and the once or twice a mistake was made, the Manager caught it and brought us a free pie before we even knew there was a problem.  What?  MORE pizza?  Yeah, I"m gonna refuse that.Great pies, great service, nice ambiance, especially with the courtyard patio.  Prices are compatible with other "high-end" pizza places, but the value is greater.
Village Inn=I was drug here kicking and screaming by my hair! Imagine you are out with your "friends" It's late OK very late or maybe early around 3am ish any way.. Your drunk and starving what do you do demand Waffle house or Jack in the Box! No such luck with this bunch, they pulled in to Village Inn. I am not a happy drunk at this point. I finally come to terms with the fact that our designated driver will not drive me elsewhere and begin to review the menu. I decide on a patty melt with onion rings. I am whining about my choice and just generally being a belligerent drunk wanting to boycott. Then the food came and quickly I might add. Holy rye bread drenched in butter and grilled to perfection. This was a damn good patty melt. I wanted to order another! I have been back 3 times since sober to get it and it is good. The onion rings I get with it are decent too. That is why they have a 5 star from me the deliciousness of that little patty melt they get 4 snaps in a circle!Damn Patty is like a monkey on my back now, Just gotta get my fix!
Vito's Pizza=First off , I have never gotten out of that restaurant without paying at least $30. WIth a family of four , around $80+ not including drinks. The food is okay if you like a slice of pizza that is mainly made up of sauce and bread with barely any cheese or toppings.So much sauce , it was like soup! Then to top off the crappy food was the staff. It is 100+ degrees outside and they had a problem with us wearing shorts and flip flops. But hey they still let us in. Maybe the reason our food was crappy was because they didn't like our clothes. Until things change , I won't be wasting any more money here.I suggest that if this restaurant wants to survive , they need to re think their menu , and straighten up the employees attitudes , big time.And to everyone else who put more than 3 stars on your review , either you don't have tastebuds , or you got paid to do your review.
Rizanos Pizza and Pasta=I haven't been to Verrazano's in quite some time but after a few trusted Yelpers kept mentioning their pizza on YT, I had it in my mind to come back for a slice when the craving hit.I stopped in today for a single slice of cheese. The pizza was solid and I really liked the crust. Not too thin, not too thick. Perfect texture and chewyness factor was on point. For $2.25 I'll be back for a basic slice from time to time. They also offer quite a few lunch specials at reasonable prices. Why I always forget about this place when searching for pizza in the area is beyond me.Verrazano Pizza is located in a not-so-busy shopping center, nestled in between a barber shop and a CVS. I came here for a quick bite to eat before work and was pretty much satisfied with what I ordered.Customer service was alright, but I could tell that some of the workers there are forcing their kindness, which ends up being an awkward experience for both parties involved, to be honest. I had two slices of their pepperoni and mushroom pizza, New York style. It was thin and crispy but packed with a lot of flavor from the two toppings. I just wish there was a little bit more cheese on the slices because it seemed a little sparing.This pizza joint is pretty convenient because it's right around the corner from where I live, so I'll probably order from them again in the future. Plus, the prices for their pizzas (whole pies and individual slices) aren't that bad and won't break the bank! Sounds like a deal to me! I have to try their wings and (maybe) their salad options next time.
IHOP=I came here on the Thanksgiving morning after running a race and I was hungry and cold (running in a cold weather, my lungs were hurting. I was surprised how busy they were.  I ordered a cup of hot chocolate. It really helped me warm up.  Food was okay, gave me the energy I needed. Standard iHop food.Service was great! Considering how busy they were, our server kept up with great service with nice smile. Food came fast, I ate very quick as I was so hungry, I was on my way with full tummy.
Black Bear Diner=It was my second time visit to Black Bear Diner since a couple years back. All I can remember is that I had a big portion of comfortable and tasty breakfast meal with a strong cup of coffee( I enjoy drinking bold in the morning). I decided to try it again on one Sunday morning. When I walked in, it was a full house! I waited about 5 min and got a table. I knew what I wanted,,, Omelette, Omelette, & Omelette :) *My Happy Meal of the Dayyy: 1. South of the Border Omelette-seasoned ground beef OR chorizo with ortega chilies, jack cheese, avocado and homemade salsa, served with a flour tortilla. Choice of strip-cut hash browns OR red diced potatoes($8.99): I had the chorizo and the red potatoes.. 2. Coffee with vanilla cream and sugar: It was bold & smooth. Well, I really enjoyed my meal. The service was provided promptly by friendly waitress. The portion was HUGE that I had to take some home. There was no cut-off time for ordering breakfast here. I prefer real all day breakfast places for a late breakfast( I am pretty much a late riser on weekends). I noticed that a full service menu is offered for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'll definitely give them another shot. Nowadays, I can't seem to find very many good hole in the wall, mom and pop owned places to have a breakfast in LV. It is definitely a chain world out here in the city! Sad, really....However, The Black Bear Diner serves up some good home cooking :) There are no strangers here at the Black Bear - only friends you haven't met yet :PFirst time going here tonight with the family. We decided to go since none of the "usual" choices was working out. Thankfully it was really close to where we live. The service, at least to me, is quite good. There was some waiting to do but not horrible. For drinks: mom, lil' bro, and I ordered the OJ. Mom's bf ordered coke lol. I'm an OJ-type of girl. I even ask my grandma to buy bag-fulls of oranges just to freshly squeeze them for me in the morning. I have to say, their OJ was yummy--didn't have too much pulp but you can tell they're not store-bought. I ordered the Bear Paw Chicken-Fried Steak alongside red-skinned mashed potatoes, corn bread muffin and lots of heavenly gravy. I also ordered a side of their famous Sweet Cream pancakes (short stack).  Mom ordered the T-Bone steak with baked potato and their muffin as well. Bro ordered their Gardenstyle Veggie burger with Jack cheese and fries on the side. Mom's bf ordered the BIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and eggs. He got it with hash browns, but instead of the biscuits he opted for the pancakes. My chicken noodle soup and mom's salad came first. Soup was okay; not salty and the serving size was just right (since the main dishes were HUGE). We waited a little bit for our orders but I wasn't complaining at all, since I'd usually be getting antsy after 10-15 minutes of waiting. I got my pancakes first, slobbered butter all over and pretty much drenched them in syrup (yum!) Short stack comes with two pancakes the size of regular dinner plates at my house, my mom was surprised at how their "short stack" was too big of an order. The top pancake was a little burnt, so that's a bit of a downside, but the bottom one was the most perfect pancake I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. I've been searching for a good breakfast place and I think I've found it in Black Bear! As I was still waiting for my main order, I took a bite off of my brother's veggie burger. The texture of the patty told my taste buds it ain't real meat, but the taste definitely passed the test. Their fries were also pretty good, I actually ate a lot of it (sorry bro!) My mom also gave me a piece of her steak; now, I'm not much of a steak person when I'm not craving it, but that piece of meat was juicy and flavorful. My chicken-fried steak finally came, and the first bite was enough for me to rave about this place. I've had "country-fried" or "chicken-fried" steak from other places, namely casinos, and they all were too salty or too dry/hard or just plain yucky! I didn't even used a knife to cut it, and when I put it in my mouth it just melted. It was crunchy and creamy and all sorts of heavenly goodness in one bite! The side of mashed potatoes were also quite awesome, I like how they used red potatoes--best kind for mashed. The veggies tasted good too; a little greasy at times but hey, that's what diner food is all about. We couldn't go for dessert, everyone was just too full and in food heaven by the time we were done. Gave our server $10 tip since she was attentive the whole time. Definitely going back next time I'm craving breakfast food :DSo i went here for the 1st time a few weeks ago.Wow I have been missing out big time...This place is fantastic! It was hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there were so many tempting items. I got the Bigfoot Chicken fried steak and it comes with soup or salad and a corn bread muffin I chose a salad with ranch which I must say was very tasty ranch and the muffin was so sweet and soft. You also get a choice of sides I  ordered the red skinned mashed potatoes and baked beans let me tell you I have never had baked beans that good they were sweet and spicy and had sausage and bacon in them mmm mmm good. Now on to the main dish the chicken fried steak it was tasty fried goodness covered in homemade gravy the meat was very good quality this is definitely the best chicken fried steak I have ever had.Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the service was excellent and the price was right.I cant wait to return to this restaurant there are so many other delicious looking items I wanna try.We had a failed attempt at going to brunch elsewhere so I popped on my app to figure out some of my bookmarks. It's funny, I used to live in walking distance, but I never tried to go then and a bit sad that perhaps I missed out. It was busy, but the wait was not long at all, about 5-10 minutes. We were amused and creeped out by the decor in the meantime. There are a bunch of teddybears lining a ledge around the main dining room. They somehow seem to just be looking at me, at all times. Hehehe. The BF and I shared: Chicken fried steak - I think this is one of the best ones we've had. Its really crispy and didn't sog up with the gravy. Gravy was flavorful and the combination of the too wasn't overly salty which I find many tend to be. Fajita chicken omelette - this was just OK. A bit too much peppers and everything was in big chunks that it would have been better diced up in it and with cheese present. I can't remember if it's supposed to come with cheese, but it should, I wouldn't order again. The egg itself is fluffy though so they can make a solid omelette here but these toppings I wouldn't do again. Your breakfast comes with a choice of potatoes or fruit. We tried both kinds. Normally I would pick country potatoes over hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns here are slightly bigger shreds are were good. The country potatoes has peppers and onions with it and those were decent too. My only critique is I'm going to order extra crispy on both next time as the country only had one side sizzled and the hashbrowns would be better with a more crispy top to contrast the soft potatoes below.You get a bread as well. I got one of their biscuits which is pretty good of a biscuit that I normally don't eat a lot of my bread during breakfast, but I had to eat some with honey and butter. The BF really wanted a pancake, but a short stack is too much and their prices are odd in that it's only $1 less than a full stack so it makes it kinda not worth it. Apparently, you can sub your bread for one pancake and I don't think they charge for that either. We wanted a blueberry one and that was 99cents upgrade. This pancake was really good. I love that they put a lot of blueberries inside the batter since heating up the berries brought out their sweetness and the cake itself was nicely fluffy. Sidenote, I love their own bottled habanero hot sauce that is on every table. I sprinkled that onto my omelette. Service was friendly and attentive despite it being busy. She took her time giving us suggestions and answering our questions. We were checked on often and got our drinks filled efficiently. We were seated quickly and we were checked out fast as well. My first time, but it seems they know what they're doing. Despite it being a chain, it didn't feel like one and all items made from scratch is a huge plus. Most "mom and pops" don't make their own sausages or potatoes. We took home some treats too. Their bear claw was alright...the inside was plain sugar with strong cinnamon and not a smooth filling paste. It is better eaten warm and it's more puff pastry and not croissant like some people think it will be. It's one of those personal preference type things. Their blackberry cobbler had me confused as cobbler to me equals crumb top and crust on the bottom and this had crust all the way on the top. Once we opened it, there was only crust on top, none of the bottom just fruit filling hence the cobbler part I suppose since it's a partial crust only. It was decent with lots of blackberry in it, I just wish it was a actual mini pie because the crust was flaky. Even with a few minor hiccups/preferences, I was still pretty pleased so we will be back I'm sure. If you want big portioned all American, no frills breakfast, this probably should be on the shortlist of choices. If you are into chicken fried steak this will probably be the best you can get in the city.Black Bear Diner is an icon that has stood at the corner of Jones and Tropicana for years. Contrary to what the name might imply to some people, Black Bear Diner did not start out serving bear meat. It started as an inn in Mount Shasta, California that overlooked a strawberry patch that was inhabited by both people and black bears. Approximately ninety years later Black Bear Diner seems to be a healthy business. They have several locations including this very one at the northwest corner of Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard.   Black Bear Diner operates by six (6) credos. I have put each credo to the test. This review lists each credo with Yelping feedback. Please bear with me, while I grow my yelp into a growl while I give feedback on each of the six credos.Credo #1: We will make Black Bear Diner a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. We offer you great food and an experience reminiscent of a time when a small-town restaurant was the place to go for talk, friendship and atmosphere.A Yelper's growl: On my visits that occurred during the afternoon of June 22 and the morning of June 23, 2013; the lodge theme made me relaxed. There is nothing like a hundred stuffed bears to make me feel at ease. Black Bear Diner reminds me more of a bear themed Cracker Barrel than a small-town restaurant. The menu which mimics a newspaper and the place mats were interesting reading material. Being in the information age where friends, especially yelp friends are within the touch of a handheld device, I could say that the excellent Verizon reception contributed to making this a place for friendship.Credo #2: We are dedicated to serving freshly prepared home cooking. From scratch sausages and biscuits to our legendary Black Bear Cobbler, everyone at Black Bear Diner goes the extra mile to provide you with the best in good old fashioned family food, prepared fresh every day.A Yelper's growl: Based on the Shasta cheeseburger with fries that I ate on June 22 and the Bear's Choice Breakfast special that I ate on June 23; I thought that the food was good yet not extraordinary. I would have appreciated more cheese on the Shasta cheeseburger, warmer fries, and a choice of syrups and toppings for the pancakes.Credo #3 We deliver each meal just the way you order it.A Yelper's growl: This ought to be mentioned when the server takes your order. When I ordered the Bear's Choice Breakfast, this would have been nice if it was brought to my attention. I would of enjoyed more beacon instead of pancakes.Credo#4: We believe in value-hearty portions of good food. We buy huge platters and we fill them, so don't be afraid to take leftovers home!A Yelper's growl: The portions are huge. However, I feel that instead of filling up a lot of the plate with fries that they ought to replace some of them with the choice of potato salad or cole slaw. For the record fries are not the kind of food that tastes good warmed up. Credo #5: We feature healthy options because we care about our customers.A Yelper's growl: I do not go to a diner, especially named Black Bear to eat healthy. I say good for them for featuring healthy options. I would like to add that all the stuffed bears and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health. Stuffed bears have a way of reducing my stress level. Credo #6: If you have comments that bear repeating, please tell us. If you have extraordinary service, or have something to growl about, we want to hear from you. Please visit our website to let us know how we are doing.A Yelper's growl: Growling on business websites is not my style. My style is to growl on Yelp. With that in mind my growl of Black Bear Diner is 3  1/2 stars.***The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. This is review 90***The first thing you notice about this place is that they are actually true to theme of the name of their restaurant. Everywhere you look, there is something that has to do with black bears. You don't see that at every place you go to eat at.Since im trying to stay away from red meat, I ordered the Spicy Turkey on Sourdough Bread. It came with onion rings. If you refer to my pic, the sandwich itself is pretty big. I gotta say it was very tasty with a little kick to it. It Definitely filled me up.Service was above average meaning she came around and checked up on me every now and then. I only had to ask for refills once so she was on point for the most part.I would say this place is a decent place to go to if plan A falls through. For some reason I thought they were 24 hours but they have had the same hours since they opened long ago.So this place to me is ok in my book. Decent food, service, and ambiance. Nothing really stands out and nothing really deserves a complaint.What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.I ordered from their "little less" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a "Bear Claw" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.4.5 starsI came here for breakfast and liked it more than I expected. I had seen these places in California before but thought it was something different. My loss... until now! The inside might be lined with stuffed animals like your grandmas house or little sisters room but don't let any of that fool you. This place is solid.  So I ordered The Volcano breakfast. 3 pancakes (made with sweet cream), 2 pieces of bacon, scrambled eggs with cheese and a sausage patty. The pancakes were great and the bacon was cooked to order. The sausage is made at the restaurant and has a nice taste and my eggs were hot and good. It was a nice pile of food for $8. Our waitress was very good and even stopped to talk to us about the restaurant and some of the popular things on the menu. OH YEAH..... check out the humongous bear claws they have in the glass case as you walk in.When in Rome, eat pizza.If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  I'll call it CFS from here on out but "Chicken from Satan" might be a better acronym.It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entrée was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!Funny how "comfort food" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.Had it not been for Yelp and Philip T's recent visit, I don't know that I ever would have discovered the Black Bear Diner. I am quite certain this was my best breakfast experience in recent memory and possibly the best Chicken Fried Steak I've had in Vegas. They have knifes big enough to take down a tree, but there is no need. Tender and flaky, a fork was all I needed to tackle this breakfast feast. I went with country potatoes cooked up fresh with peppers and onions. It comes standard with a  biscuit or toast. I opted to substitute a pancake, which Candy obliged without hesitation. The pancake was so good we passed it around the table and ordered two more. They come with plenty of piping hot syrup, which is a good thing because JR drenched his pants with the first one. No need to wax this week. The over-easy eggs were cooked to perfection and the coffee was better than average. Our server, Candy, was as friendly as they come and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Great food, friendly staff and, with buddies like JR, great entertainment.This place serves a pretty good breakfast, even for being a chain. However, the service was a little reminiscent of what a normally experience at a Denny's or Cocoa's, but with better food. I ordered the Shasta Scramble which came with avocados, spinach, tomato, onion, bell pepper, and Jack Cheese all served with a housemade biscuit. I can't remember the price, but I know it was under $10.The three egg scramble was well scrambled and seasoned. I liked that they did not hold back on the avocado and vegetables, especially the spinach. The sprinkling of Jack Cheese was light, but just right, and the onions and peppers still had a slight crunchy appeal.The potatoes were simple but effective. They were cooked well with a little browning on the outside and tender inside. They could of benefited from a little extra seasoning. The biscuit was okay. It was baked to mild density and was moist. However, it's flavor was a little bland, with its spotty areas of salt. I was glad they served the biscuit with soft whipped butter. Service was okay. I felt our server was forcing a smile or perhaps she was just not a morning person. Anyways, she was friendly enough, but it just did not feel genuine. On the good side, we got served, ate good food, and had no issues, so that's all good.3.8 stars is what my gut tells me..I had been wanting to try Black Bear Diner for quite some time, the opportunity finally presented itself on Saturday afternoon, so I took advantage. I strolled in on an early Saturday afternoon, with small children and a teenager in tow. My boys immediately took a liking to all the bear decor, Black Bear Diner is truly living up to its name. The hostess immediately greeted us and we were seated right away. The bus person came out, took our drink orders and let us know the server would be with us shortly. Meanwhile we were waiting, we had plenty of time to look over the menu, by the time our server appeared, we all knew what to order. Our server was friendly but a bit stand-offish, she wouldn't make eye contact. Items Ordered:-Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich-Chocolate Cream PieOur food came out about 10 minutes after placing our order, so it came out quick! I ordered my sandwich with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. The meat was tender but it had no flavor, it was very bland. It came with a side of au jus so that made it a little bit better. They don't skimp on fries here. Everyone's plate had an abundance of fries, the seasoning they use made them taste great. Now, onto dessert, the chocolate cream pie was amazing! It was really rich and creamy, it was the best part of the meal. It came topped with a lot of whipped cream and chocolate chips, the bottom layer of the crust is chocolate. Since we came in after 11 a.m., my boys received a free sundae with their meal.Overall, I would return but next time I would try something else on the menu since I wasn't a fan of the tri-tip dip sandwich. Food is decent, service is good but our server could have been a little bit more attentive. As we were leaving, our boys were given a balloon each by the hostess, I thought that was a nice gesture for the small patrons.The food is great that is the only reason for my 1 starHowever to the POS manager DON YOU HAVE SOME NERVE!!1st off hire more staffing if you know that you are hurting with the wait time and service. (Common sense)We waited 20 mins to be seated not bad but then 45 mins to an hour more just to get our food!!! You were arrogant and rude you yelled at your poor waitress who was trying so desperately to accommodate to her full area. Everyone was upset! You them tell me nd other customers that our meal would be comped which it wasnt. Now the thing that truly upset me was our poor waitress was so upset she was crying. She was  apologizing for the service since the other waitresses were grabbing her food and she couldn't provide the service she wanted....never ever put down your staff in front of clients!!!Horrible service not because of the waitress but because of management!!!! Fire DON hire someone that knows what he is doing, maybe then he can stop comping out meals!!!!!! And make it enjoyable!!!
Carmen's Bistro=So we were looking for something different in Tempe. Well, we found it. So far the worst Italian I've had in the valley. Look at my stats. One star reviews are rare for me. I'll usually go back at least once to give them another chance. But I'll make an exception in this case, because there's no way I'm ever goin' back to this place.Should have known something was up when the waitress brought our drinks over talking on a cordless phone. "No," she said. "I can't talk right now. No. I'm working. I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks. Can I call you back? I'll call you back. Bye." When she put the phone down we ordered the eggplant parmesan. Big mistake. Looked and tasted like someone hid it at the bottom of the deep fryer and forgot about it. For 3 days. There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant. More like... cardboard. mmmm... cardboard parmesan. Seriously, it was gross. Sad thing was we were absolutely starving and on our way to a show so we ate it. Well, most of it. It came with a side of spaghetti, which was all right. Not as gross as the eggplant, but still not good.Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert. Worst canoli ever. The dough was hard and stale, and the filling was strangely sour and so thick that technically I don't think it could be classified as cream. More like... gel.Bad service, bad food. Beware.I'm sorry Carmen's but you are getting a one star review. I should have known as soon as I walked in this was not the sort of place to eat at. Should have just bellied up to the bar instead of ordering food, but we were starving. The eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extremely over fried. There we were pools of grease on the plate that they tried to mask by covering it with sauce and cheese (nice try) but you still could taste the overused deep fried oil remnants.The drinks were weak. Very weak.The canoli had the same deep fried stale taste and it was filled with cream that resembled the consistency of toothpaste.The meal was one of the worst I have had in ages. Hands down, I will not be returning.DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RESTAURANT!!!  This restaurant deserves no stars.Foolishly and uncharacteristically, I did not check Yelp because my wife said she had been here in the past and it was fine.  She obviously blotted it from her mind as a horribly traumatic experience.When we walked in, we didn't need to be seated because there was only one other couple in the restaurant, the first bad sign. The second was there was not a server in sight.  After about 5 minutes, a sever did appear from the back somewhere.  She asked for our drink order and I told her we were ready to order our dinners also, My wife ordered lasagne, which was an early bird special.  Bad sign #3.  The waitress asked her if she wanted the lunch or dinner portion (it was 6:30pm).  My wife replied that she wanted the early bird special.  The waitress grabbed the menu to examine it stating that she wasn't familiar with it because she was just here temporarily.  I ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and iced tea.Bad sign #4.  The waitress brought my iced tea. What could be wrong with iced tea? It was the foulest, most undrinkable concoction I ever attempted to drink.  When the waitress came by, I told her the iced tea was undrinkable & to bring me a Diet Coke. She came back shortly with a glass of regular Coke because they didn't carry Diet.  I said fine.  Shortly thereafter, an older man came out and said he heard that my tea wasn't good so he would bring me a fresh one.  He brought me the (fresh) one.  I didn't think it was possible, but it tasted worse than the first one.The salads came and they were OK.  They had fresh leaf lettuce, with tomato and onion, but the italian dressing tasted like Wishbone (Thank God they didn't make it themselves).Now for the entrees.  I won't go into any detail, but suffice it to say, if Taco Bell & Jack in the Box made lasagne and Chicken Cacciatore, I would eat it there before I'd set foot in this restaurant.  By the way, I haven't been to either of those places in the past 20 years.My wife and I agreed, this was the worst restaurant we have ever eaten in and I'm talking about literally thousands of restaurant meals.  I cannot fathom how this "restaurant" is still in existence.I have definitely learned my lesson.  I will never ever forget to check Yelp before I go to a new restaurant for fear that I might have blotted this nightmare out of my mind as my wife obviously did.
Los Betos Mexican Food=Dropped by this location for lunch one day.  At first glance at the sign, I thought it was an "ertos" restaurant...so I was hoping to add to my list, but alas I was wrong.  Anyway, back to the food...I ordered:Beans Rice Cheese Burrito, $3.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQ#h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQCarne Asada Taco, $2.70http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3g#G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3gCarnitas Taco, $2.70http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469w#JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQ#71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQMed Diet Coke, $1.55http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEA#pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEAWhile I was waiting for my order, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up.  I saw that they had the typical Green & Red runny, mild Salsa and some Chunky Spicy Salsa...yes!  I like spicy, so I grabbed a few cups and filled them up.  Slight problem though...the cups for the Salsa were the soft, paper like cups typically used for Ketchup & Mustard.  You're probably wondering why that's a problem?  Well, it's because when you fill it up with Salsa, it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place....yep, it was very messy.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA#g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHAThe food came out a short while later and I started with the Carne Asada Taco....it is a pretty big portion for Street Tacos.  The portion size was the only positive though....the meat was bland....and the Guacamole and Pico de Gallo that was on the Taco didn't help much.Next was the Carnitas Taco.  This one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the Carne Asada....however, it was average at best.Last but not least was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  This was very good.  Some Mexican Joints like these have oily BRC Burritos...but not here.  There was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The Tortilla was very good as well.Overall, my experience here was average...3 Stars.  If I do come back, it would be strictly for the BRC Burrito.Return Factor - 50%"Even bad Mexican food is good."  That's what I always say.  This place is pretty good actually.  I really like the tortillas-big and thin.  Reminds me of the tortillas I used to eat from a Mexican bakery when I was little.  The kind  that are so big, you can punch holes in them and wear them.  Hey, it's fun when you're 5!Anyway, I do like the food overall.  I really like the fact there's a drive-thru, so when I'm looking and feeling my worst, I don't have to worry about people thinking, "the last thing she needs is a taco plate."  Why only 3 stars you ask?  Because the meat is...well, you know how when you cut up a roast and throw out all the fatty, grisly parts.  I think they comb the streets for those parts.  But, they do make 'em taste pretty darn good.If cleanliness is next to godliness then The Betos is perched on the rim of the 6th circle of hell.That doesn't mean it's bad mexican food. In fact, it's decent enough to be a "guilty Pleasure". But you will be guilty (you will also not be constipated the next morning, ahhh, the lubricating effects of copious amounts of animal fat).I was helping my daughter buy and assemble some IKEA furniture (and I use the word "furniture" loosely in conjunction with IKEA) and she bought me lunch at The Betos (are they a family, or what?). She didn't realize that I had been here before (as I said...it's a guilty pleasure...I don't advertise things like this as a general rule). She had just found it, with her roommate, as a late night drive through dinner spot.We decided to eat at one of the picnic tables and when I got out of the truck, my first thought was "is there a rendering plant in Scottsdale"? No, but you are in the grease trap nexus that exists between Whataburger and The Betos. This is a vortex of decades old cooking grease molecules that will swirl between these 2 establishments and survive until the next ice age freezes them for our ancestors to study.My carne asada tacos were pretty decent...greasy and tasty. I got some hot sauce (can it be called "hot sauce" if it's not either thing?...just wondering...I suppose "tomato-ey water" doesn't hit the right marketing buttons). Whit had a couple of cheese enchilada's. We were full to the brim and on our way to recovering from IKEA assembly. Just what I needed to slide (pun intended) into the weekend.Any of you who read this who have ever been in love will be able to relate:There's a first pang of distress, when the knife blade pierces the skin, when you know you are in for some pain.  But the endorphins kick in and you realize that you are in for more than you ever bargained for...At los betos, after a few (5, 10, 20?) drinks, I had the sad misfortune of ordering a carnitas burrito at 220 in the am.  And what did I receive, but the most delectable delight ever served in the pinche madrugada ( rejoice, all my spanish speaking compañeros, a cuss word or two to titillate you).  The carnitas were cooked to a perfect crispy exterior, while the innards burst forth with a cornucopia of spices and flavors that made my very synapses fire indiscriminately with glee.But, not to be outdone, heartburn would make its own dastardly play for my overwhelmed nerve endings, tearing me from neck to knave with pain.  Did I stop, even for one excruciating second?  Yes, but only long enough to pour on more green sauce, villainously spicy in a way that no beto, be it fili, rol, or eri, has ever been.  Nay, I succumbed to the sweet agony of picante and used that to goad me forth into the foxhole against the onslaught of acid reflux.Each bite brought both more pain, acute, dire, and relentless, but also a sweet symphony of flavors that can only mean guacamole and green sauce replete with all the accoutrements.  I fought, and fought back hard, and what I can tell you is this:No burrito has ever caused me such pain and yet no burrito has ever granted me such pleasure.  Like a sine curve, plunging predictably from zenith to nadir and back again, los betos has given me the pleasure--nay, the honor, of feeling every physical sensation known to sentient vertebrates.Five glorious, painful, resonating stars.  Five harrowing yet riveting stars.  Five supernovas, five black holes, five big bangs of taste.  The world has never known anything like what I have just experienced.  You too can have what I had... all it takes is intestinal fortitude enough to jump in the car with a beer bong and head straight to thomas and hayden.  Oh, and leave the zantac at home, puss.I was on a mission from god (very small "g") today:) and needed a quick retox...Los Betos filled that role with...wait for it...three rolled tacos and a coke:)And yes, retoxifying, they were...chock full of greasy, cheesy, and salsa covered goodness:)My rolled tacos were very edible...and they didn't get my order wrong (more than I can say about a certain redhead's burger joint:)...but really, how can you screw up the rolled tacos?...You can't:)Just for places like this, I've created a chart with the "crap to quality ratio", in honor of Ryan C:)...(see "photo" attached...you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to attach a chart:)Although originally developed by Ryan C, in his secret lair, to asses quality  and quantity  of Boofay's, I've discovered these calculations work quite nicely for any type of greasy, divey, suspect, shady, oddball, sketchy, rough, funny smelling, bizarre, foreign, wacky, oddball, outré and outrageous eateries:)Thanks Ryan:) Bon Appetite:)...
Los Olivos=Thank you for ruining my Saturday afternoon.It's been 15 hours since I ate here and I am just now starting to feel normal again.  I've been eating tums and chasing them with soda (to settle my stomach) as well as making several bathroom trips.  I have never been this sick from eating anywhere.  I think Taco Bell would have been far superior and they don't even serve real meat!    The chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked. My entree was the chicken burrito,  I think they use chicken in a can b/c the meat was so dry and shredded.  The waitress offered a sauce on top and good thing I accepted b/c otherwise I would have had to choke down the dry burro.  Gordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.  I think they need to pare down the menu because there are too many choices and most of it is the same crap just re-worded.  Also, I kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit.  If you don't have any tables you could be helping out in other ways.     This place really lacked warmth from the staff and I think it's important to make your customers feel welcome. I really don't see myself coming here ever again unless they make huge changes.Some colleagues and I had lunch here recently.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are served with your meal.  After browsing the menu, I went for the Cheese and Onion Enchiladas w/Rice & Beans.  The dish came out fast and on an extremely hot plate......be careful of these plates, you'll burn your hand if you touch them.After letting the food simmer down, I went for a bite of the Enchiladas....they were really good!  I poured some of the Hot Sauce that came with the Chips & Salsa on top of the Enchiladas to give them a nice kick....yum!The service here was really good and they were very friendly.  We had a great time.Return Factor - 90%I don't know how long Los Olivos has been around, but by the looks of it, it seems like a pretty long time! Old Town doesn't have many old-style Mexican food restaurants with a classic atmosphere like Los Olivos. For this reason, Los Olivos gets four stores in my book. Los Olivos reminds me of Mexican food restaurants I used to visit as a child. They have fiesta-themed decorations, plenty of decorated tile, an adobe mission style atmosphere and good food and drinks. Yes, there is better food in the Valley...much better in fact. However, Los Olivos is a good choice if you want to have a casual dinner in a festively-themed atmosphere that serve margaritas in pitchers! For food, I eat the same type of Mexican food everywhere I go, and the same goes for Los Olivos. I like their guacamole, quesadillas, chile rellenaos and chicken burritos. As for the margaritas, they are classic margaritas that go down smoothly. Again, this restaurant gets the stars mostly for a festive atmosphere and decent cuisine and cocktails to accompany it.Went to dinner with some friends, we were celebrating a friends presence , she had moved out of the valley almost 2 years ago, we were a party of 8.  This was my 1st time to Los Olivos and I was kind of excited to try them out. Unfortunately sometimes being me requires you to attend more than one party in a day, so I just came from another party where I had already filled up on some food, so I wasn't very hungry, but wanted to join my friends in the fun!I was about ten minutes late, asked the hostess were my friends were seated at, and was told, oh just look around till you find them, we have a few parties here tonight.  I thought well isn't that nice I get to roam in a place I don't know very well. But turns out I didn't have to go far, I found them in the 2nd room.I sat down, and was browsing the menu, our server came to me and said what are you drinking and looked a little perturbed that I joined this table. I just told her water. I wasn't the last one to the party, my other friend showed up 5 mins after me, and she got the same chilly attitude from the server. And with a big party like ours, it didn't really matter how bad the service was, because the tip was already added to our bill. Everyone placed there order, I wound up ordering Deep Fried Ice Cream, since I was already a meal ahead of everyone. While waiting for our food, I was munching on the chips and salsa, now I'm not a fan of the salsas, the "hotter" one was way to seedy for me. I like hot salsa, but I don't like feeing like I'm eating sunflower seeds. And the mild salsa was like a pico de gallo minus any peppers and runny. I mixed the 2 together, and that didn't really help either, so eating chips and salsa wasn't working for me.Now the deep fried ice cream that was perfect! The sweet taste of honey, the crispy outer shell and the cold ice cream made a perfect treat for this hot summer day!I really wanted to like Los Olivos, maybe I'll go to the other location and give them another try.
The Chuck Box=You all familiar with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld?I found the Burger Nazi.  I went in for my first time today. I was standing a good 10 feet from the counter, in line behind someone else, when the gruff man behind the counter shouted "What'll it be?" Now I'd never been here before so I was still sizing up the menu. It was all new to me. He put his arms out with raised palms as if to say "WTF dude?" and shouted louder and more firmly, "WHAT'LL IT BE?" I didn't want to piss the guy off any further (never piss off the people who make your food) so I just picked the burger that I happened to be looking at on the menu. He says "Ok, cheese?" I say, "Sure." He gives me the same "WTF" look and said with a sarcastic drawl, "Ok, elaborate....?" I asked him my options, he recited them to me, and I selected cheddar. But oh no, the burger Nazi couldn't leave it at that. The sarcastic drawl returned and he muttered "I thought you would have SEEN it while you were STARING AT THE MENU..."I couldn't believe I'd heard what I'd just heard so I said "Excuse me?" to give him an attempt to redeem himself. Nope. He just repeated exactly what he had said, this time even more defiantly. I almost expected him to shout, "NO BURGER FOR YOU. YOU COME BACK, ONE YEAR."A place like this can get by with HORRIBLE customer service because there is an endless stream of braindead college kids eating there because they think it's some kind of tradition. Forget it, I'm never returning. Not that Burger Nazi really cares anyways...Great Burgers and it's next to ASU in Tempe. This place is always a fun and a tasty treat. The outside is an old rusty brown building that reminds me of a hippie shack out in the woods. The smell of mesquite smoke and burgers hit you as you get out of your car. The inside is also very hip with a simple old timey feeling such as thick wooden crates for seats, barrels for trash cans and amusing tidbits hanging on the walls.Easy menu to pick from with several burger or chicken options as well as sides. You can choose from Little to Big to Great BIG as far as sizes of burgers. I always get the Great BIG one which is a 1/2 pound of juicy CHUCK with the cheese of my choice and some green chilies. They cook it right before your eyes while standing in line. I also enjoy the onion rings which are beer battled and really big and tasty. The condiment bar is very large with plenty of room to stock up on all the things you would want at a family picnic and then some. Nice.Parking is tricky being next to the campus. Bring change for the meter if you cannot get in their private lot. Also get there as early as possible to avoid the long line of HUNGRY people. CASH ONLY. Enjoy!
Thai BBQ=I thought I would give this place another try and it's still disappointing. Service was starting off very well, until I informed them of the broken piece of glass I bit inside their sticky rice. They stopped making eye contact and coming around the table. Ordered-Papaya Salad- they used bottled lemon juice which is wierd. Left a bad taste.Chicken BBQ- 4 pieces of dried up chicken and you can tell the chicken was precooked and old.Pork Rib BBQ dinner- fried rice was sweeter than usual and the ribs again was precooked, you will know by the way the bones are bone dry.Tom Ka Gai- flavor was good but the chicken was slimy so we stopped eating it. Sticky rice - typical, microwaved and the pieces of glass as a treat.So after they were told of the pieces of glass, they offered to give me a new one. Which I refused and then they just disappeared. They did remove $2 off my bill.
Don & Charlie's=This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.It's a ritual.  In February, hoards of people flock to Phoenix to escape the chill, play golf, watch spring training, and go to Don and Charlie's.Don and Charlie's is an institution around this area, especially during February and March.  Dine here and more than likely you'll see a big league player, manager, scout, etc.  Tonight there were some Milwaukee Brewers dining with us.This place is covered with so much sports memorabilia, you feel like you're dining in a museum.  I think the memorabilia is worth more than the restaurant, and it's definitely worth more than the food.  Expect a long wait if you come at prime time, as this place does get busy.Food - your typical upscale ribs, steak, and prime rib place.  Good but not great; the memorabilia is the main attraction here and is worthy of four stars.Do you like meat? Feel like checking out the most legendary restaurant known to the spring training crowd? You've found it. Don and Charlies was a part of my growing up. Beginning in a booster seat and now as an adult, I've spent many nights enjoying the food and atmosphere at Don and Charlie's. When you walk in, the walls are stocked with pictures of those who've visited over the years as well as some classic memorabilia. The low ceilings give it the feeling of a members-only club. It's Old Arizona to the tee and on most nights, it'll have a wait list out the door of the old timers. I love it here. It could be the memories, the great All-American food, the fact that I had my first date here with my now fiance, the pitchers of diet coke they provide or just the vibrant environment and character...but whatever it is, I'm happy every time I walk inside. Like I said, it's solid All-American cookin' like BBQ chicken, great tender beef or pork ribs that fall right off the bone, awesome steaks, mouthwatering au gratin potatoes and the list goes on and on. Start with a Cesar salad, order their famous BBQ ribs for dinner, accompany it with Au Gratin potatoes and finish the meal with a Goldbrick Sundae. Whether you're in town for spring training or you're just up for a going out to dinner, I suggest giving Don and Charlie's a try. This place shouldn't be just an old timer hot spot. I am no old timer and I still enjoy my visits.WHATS WITH THE CONSTANT ........... Raising the menu prices ?????If the practice of "Comping" athletes and a particular Elite Group (see link)ended, you'd be ABLE TO LOWER PRICES.http://www.yelp.com/biz/championship-dining-experience-for-elites-at-don-and-charlies-scottsdaleHave you lost sight of the fact ........ that this will PISS customers off ?Recent diners will, pass this info along ....... to Family & Friends'.Will I, still eat at D & C ......... YES, when I have a coupon or Groupon,as I did this Evening ......otherwise NEVER !! Its obvious  business must be suffering ...... has you're doing Groupon, quite often.This is always an indication, that an established restaurant, is experiencing a decline in revenue (probably due to frequent price increases).Folks' wait for a $40 Groupon coupon (purchased for $20).$24.95 for a full slab of Baby Back Ribs, last night .... is ABSURD.         You just raised the PRICE AGAIN .....use to be $22.95There was available seating the entire Evening .... HMMMM, wonder why ??P.S.    5 years ago, the Baby Back Ribs were OUTSTANDING.               Through the past 5 years, they've slipped each year.                     It's time to clean up the appearance, both inside & out.                            How much further, are you going to go, before a Rehab ????           ***Remember "Comping", doesn't improve the bottom-line,  UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE IS PAYING FOR IT.***Was excited to try this place since I saw from their website that it had tons of sports memorobilia, and that the owner was from Chicago (where we are from).  And, it was within walking distance too.Walked over there for dinner - it was, of course, ridiculously crowded.  Problem #1 - the hostess was completely clueless and overwhelmed.  We asked how long the wait would be, she said she was unsure.  We asked if we could put our name in, she again said she didn't know.  In the meantime, they're calling other parties names for seating, so we ask again.  The hostess gets a confused look on her face and ignores us.  So.... we just sat ourselves in the bar dining area. Fifteen minutes later, a server decides to come over and ask us if we'd been helped.  She takes our drink order.  Two other servers come by and ask if we would like to order drinks, and we tell them we'd already had our drink order taken.  Throughout the course of our meal, I think four servers served us.  No clue who our actual server was.  I think this was in part because there was an ASU sports group (head coach?) in the restaurant sitting a few tables over.  It was amusing to watch the cheeseball of an owner spend the whole evening name-dropping and schmoozing with them.  Too bad it was at the expense of the other customers.  The food we ordered was actually good.  Kind of surprised that the burgers didn't come with fries, especially for over $10.  After we were done eating, it literally took almost a half hour for us to get our bill.  One of our four servers actually caught on and brought a bill and apologized for the sketchy service, but assumed we understood since the table behind us was "more important.  It is the new ASU head coach, you know."  We admired the memorobila collection as we walked out, listened to the owner do some more name-dropping about how he knew Bud Selig in the lobby, and left.  Despite the good food and impressive sports collection, we probably won't be back.  Too bad - was hoping for better.*************Their Newest RIP-OFF*************               *******Remember the FREE Chopped Liver Plate*********                       ------------------IT'S NOW $4.95----------------"Our Famous Chopped Liver Platter, sweet bell pepper strips, carrot slaw, diced onions and chopped egg................4.95"Whats next ?????? ...........Bread Basket For $4.95I've got about $50 bucks........left on a giftcard.........and then Don .........its ADIOS........The old D&C will be missed.The Owners business sense ....... is in bad shape ......same as the parking lot.Don ........ you've got a lot of Chutzpah......and its not good.This is my 3rd review for D & C .........see the other two belowI'm giving Don & Charlies 5 stars because it is an all around solid steakhouse. Everything I've tried here has been really good, from the shrimp cocktail, to their salads, and of course their big, juicy, tender steaks. But it isn't just good food, management,  servers, and even their valet guys understand what good service is. The owner/managing partner I  met was super sweet, and seemed very down to earth, in fact this whole restaurant is very cool and unpretentious. The prices are not low, but well worth a splurge. Well done Don & Charlies!
Atlas Bistro  BYOB=Am I stuck in some weird dream?Are we really at a table in the aisle of a wine store with a shopping cart seated at the head of the table? (yes, see photo)(***UPDATE*** Yelp decided ALMOST 2 YEARS LATER that my photo of THE INSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT was "specific to my experience" and therefore "not appropriate for the general business listing"...Yelp is too funny...)Did the store clerk really just tell me to not get my good trusted bottles of wine and instead suggest three of the most putrid wines I've ever had?Does the menu really have the phrase "in season" in quotes, as if the food isn't really in season but they are pretending it is?Are there really people in this "restaurant" (see the use of quotes there?) loudly cheering for the Iowa Warhawks game?Was I really just served cold duck confit?Am I really eating it?Did they really just charge me $10/bottle corkage fee on wine I paid for at the cash register 5 feet away?Did I really just wait 20 minutes for someone to take my credit card?2 stars because *overall* the food was good (even if my duck was cold).
Otto Pizza & Pastry=Otto's daughters are fucking hot. I'm a straight lady and they may or may not be of age. But those girls are cuuuuute. Sometimes they dance to '80s and indie pop mix tapes in the back, too. So, you know, if that's your thing, that's gotta be worth at least a star. Oh, what, you wanted to know about the pizza? It's fucking delicious. It's all thin-crusted and fresh and crispy. For by-the-slice, it blows Slices out of the water. It's also simple -- no Oregano's BS toppings (for the record, I like Oregano's pizza, too. But sometimes you don't want no rosemary-potato-goat cheese concoction; you just want pepperoni and some red pepper flakes).The calzones and pizza rolls are enormous and full of warm goodness.Their soda comes with crushed ice. Fuck you if you don't know why that's awesome. With girls that cute and pizza that good, Otto better watch out.
Pita Jungle=I've been back to this Pita Jungle quite a few times. Service has gotten considerably better and for that, I'm thankful. However, they still fail when it comes to putting out consistent food. I don't understand why this keeps happening. It's unfortunate because Pita Jungle is SO GOOD when it's consistent, and I really want to go here all the time, but when food comes out different every time I can't spend my money here.I thought I had a good thing going when I went on a Friday and Saturday evening. The service was excellent & the food was totally fantastic - 5 stars. Alas, these experiences tricked me into believing they had improved so I came back on a weekday during a non peak time. I ordered the same thing I did over the weekend- a chicken shwarma wrap. This time it was perfect too! I thought to myself, "Thank god, now I can start coming back here regularly." So I came back on another weekday, same time, and the chicken shwarma was all wrong. Here's what was wrong:Not enough lettuceNot enough vegetablesNot enough garlic sauceNot enough tahiniThe wrap was this little measly thing with about half the amount of dressings and veggies as when I got it the last few times. Wtf? I seriously thought I was going crazy so I came back the following week and ordered the same thing, thinking maybe it was just an off day. Nope. The same thing happened- except this time it has even less tahini and sauce. Seriously, these shwarma's don't taste half as good without a fair amount of garlic sauce and tahini. When I got it the first few times, every bite had sauce. This time, I could barely even taste it. So at this point, I asked my waiter for extra sauces and when I got the bill I found out he charged me! The thing that sucked is I didn't look at the receipt until after he swiped my card. Otherwise I would have mentioned it.I guess I should have complained to him straight up that the pita wrap tasted like crap, then maybe he wouldn't have charged me. It was still really annoying. Both those things were $0.75 each! I was not happy!I'm giving this place an extra star because the servers have finally become attentive and now I know never to come on a weekday and only on the weekends!Using their Online Ordering system is a COMPLETE waste of time. Both times we used it we ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for them to finish our food even though we ordered over an hour in advance.Both times there have been problems with the orders even though everything is in written form in front of their faces.Today, instead of individually wrapping our pitas, they gave us a bag of store bought pita bread. How tacky.When you call to make a complaint about it taking an unreasonable amount of time, and when your orders are incorrect, they treat you with a horrible attitude as if YOU did something wrong. If you make a mistake, at very least own up to it. And the food is overall pretty bland, just like all other Pita Jungle's.We will not be ordering from Pita Jungle again.I have to say this place is good. I am not a person who likes to try anything different. I like what I like and that is it. I do not like to eat dinner food for Breakfast like my girlfriend does. HeeheeSeriously, she will eat eggs for dinner and pasta with gravey for Breakfast.Anyway, pita Bread or Wrap it is a hard choice as they are both really good.The portions of food are huge. Almost too much, but hey I am not complaining.I like my sandwhiches with Garlic,not tahini.Chicken is really good and I do not normally go for chicken.Every thing seems to be really fresh I must say and the salads are great.Do you ever just crave jalapeno & cilantro hummus? No? Well I do, and still recently new in my area of town so unfamiliar to all that is in my surroundings, so I checked the Yelp app for hummus and Pita Jungle showed up, and get this it's within 3 miles of my place, so this was a win win for me!I knew what I wanted so I called my order in, I got a small side of jalapeno cilantro hummus with cucumbers and a chicken shawarma pita with garlic potatoes was told my order would be ready for pick up in 10 to 15 minutes.  Arrived at Pita Jungle, and have to say I like the setup of this place, and it seems to me that maybe each Pita Jungle is set up a little differently, which is cool, I like variety. Even the small hummus is enough to share between 2 people and the side of cucumber looked like it was maybe a whole cucumber and this side was delish, just what I was craving. The garlic potatoes are always a favorite with me at Pita Jungle but the chicken shawarma wasn't that great, I couldn't place my finger on but something was off so I didn't finish that. I can't really attest to service since I was a pick up only, but I was greeted by the hostess when I entered and showed were to get my order. Glad to have found Pita Jungle in my area, I'm sure I will be back.
Rula Bula=umm yea. there is nothing all that great about the Rulai was here with my BFF (yea like a teenage girl, lol) cause we was bored and figured get out of the spot.we took the train up to mill already half toasted on a couple cans of Mickies in thirstbuster cups care of Circle K. (heart) circle K kay..! ya know.anyways so walked up and down mill scoffing at the people looking to get fucked up. i blew up AmyD on the cell saying we would catch up with her at the sets or yucca tap room...ended up walking back to the Rula and grabbed a couple drinks. umm. yea. this place isn't really great or anything.  just kinda like all the rest of the "bars" on mill. just irish stylized. i've been here plenty of times before and never thought to myself..."wow what a great irish bar". meh. it's kinda like a themed college bar and nothing more. oh well. grabbed a couple blue moons and bizounced. threw a middle finger to mill as we jumped on the "trolly" and busted ass back to PHX screaming "602"I have worked on Mill for over a decade and Rula Bula has stood the test of time in my restaurant rotation. Last Friday I went for happy hour, and yesterday for lunch. Both expierinces were so pleasant I thought it high time to yelp it. Happy hour was great. Our bartender was attentive and funny and made sure to come around before last call. They have some great apps on special, chicken fingers, skewers, potato skins ect. Their lunch menu features weekly specials, so there is always some thing new and different to try. I went there with a group of 5 ladies and we everyone was happy with their choice. I had the grilled cheese on marble rye (with tomato and 4 types of cheese this sandwich is delicious), I have tried the boxtys, potato pies, bangers and mash, french dip and salmon - all great. Our dining experience was enjoyable last week mainly do to our server (Nathan?). He split our bill without being asked and had boxes and change before we finished eating. When you're on a lunch break, not having to wait around at the end of your meal is a big plus. Rula Bula has a great outdoor patio, fun pub atmosphere, excellent Irish pub food and is located right off the Light Rail.  You can't go wrong.Since everyday is a good day for a Guinness, and since I happen to be on Mill every single day, this is the spot I like to come to collaborate those 2 facts of life. I also really love that I get free drinks, often, but I think its just the red hair. Seriously, red heads in Irish pubs.. I could tell stories for days..Its not exactly your model Irish pub, but they have a decent happy hour, yummy menu options, lots of space and a sweet patio with an outdoor bar. The only real downfall here is the douchey dudes that are always here and that it is always retardedly packed after 8pm. Otherwise, its all good. Seriously subtract that and add a mechanical Bull or something equally obnoxious, and I'm a fan for life.Over the last year, I've noticed a rapid decline in the quality of service at Rula Bula. It used to be my favorite place to wash away my college woes, but now I don't ever want to go back.On a Friday night in May I was out celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of 10-12 people. We were all ordering food, booze and overall having an excellent time. When time comes to mosey on home, the waitress informs me that my credit card has been lost. Problem #1: If a guest's credit card is lost, a manager should always come discuss this with the guest, not the server.The waitress, Maddie, was horrified and worried, and suggested I leave my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me. She also gave me a comped beer, which I later found out wasn't comped but a beer she paid for herself. True true to her word I received a phone call shortly after close that night. For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was "left overnight".Problem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.There's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology. The managers really don't seem to care, which is an attitude that rubs off on many of the employees, save for Maddie. I'm sad to say goodbye to the best Guinness in town, but I simply can't keep justifying the poor service and lack of concern for customer satisfaction.We came in here for an Early dinner one day. For once I did not have a hard time finding a parking spot.  Beautifully decorated place inside. Very much like a place in Ireland. Just a lot cleaner, because, it is newer.Even down to the Lace curtains. The food was good, really good. Very true to Irish Food. Not something that everyone likes. But, since I grew up with the Ish food. I like it.Our service was good, Everything was hot (food) which is another plus. They do offer Free wifi, which I did not use, but if you needed it.......After dinner we sat outside on the enclosed patio area. To listen to live music which was also nice. They allow smoking on the patio. If you are into that.I would absolutely go back to eat again."The mouth of a perfectly happy man is filled with beer." ― Egyptian Proverb. Does this quote apply to those who drink Snake Bites?  Anywho!  Met up with some of my favorite Yelpers for a belated St. Paddy's Day lunch and it was great!  Rula Bula's is a cute little pub with fun Irish tunes and some delicious eats.  Their patio was looking pretty tempting on this beautiful Friday and the first day of Spring but we dined indoors.To start things off, Gillian ordered and shared her Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls with us.  Thanks for sharing those heavy balls with us, girly!  I had assumed that the spice would be present inside the deep-fried cheesy potato balls but the spice came from the hot sauce served on the side.  It was kind of nice since weaklings like me can adjust accordingly.  I had a picture but I stupidly deleted it before I posted it.  Gah!  As for my entree, I ordered the Shepherd's Pie with my side of brussel sprouts with apples.  It was delicious, buttery, and worth the calories.  Brett said he can taste Guinness in the sauce but since I was washing my food down with a Guinness Snake Bite, I can't really confirm it but it was darn delicious!  The brussel sprouts were cooked to tender perfection and I loved the bite from the apples.  I actually didn't know the brussel sprouts came with apples until I bit into one.  Yum!  That tartness really helped cut through all that richness from the potatoes and meat.  I would definitely order this again!"For each petal on the shamrock this brings a wish your way. Good health, good luck, and happiness for today and every day."  Thanks for a great lunch!Came out for lunch and looks as though the fried fish were their signature dishes or the typical bar food.  They have Guinness on tap, enough said!  They have a huge patio at the back and full bar.
Tott's Asian Diner=Before Christmas my son and his girl friend came up from Tucson for a visit and to exchange baked goodies.  She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here.Yeah!  Kickass Asian fast food!No "bobo plates", no little sterno grill to burn your own food, no 70s "Oriental" restaurant ambiance.  This is the REAL THING.  Just knock your socks off, FRESH Asian cuisine to please many palates.  Want veggie?  There's LOTS of vegetarian options for you made to order and brought to your table fast.  Chinese?  Sure.  Japanese?  That too.  They even have pho and curry plates.  You'll get a satisfying mound of food for $10 including bottomless drink.  My only caveat: don't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with--this place is LOUD.  That's okay--you'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much.Look, I'm from the SF Bay Area, where Asian joints abound.  This place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the Bay.  Best Asian spot so far that I've been to in the Valley.  If there's a better one, I have yet to find it.Go.  Eat.  Stuff thyself.There are a few times I wish I could give more than 5 stars, and this is one of them.  I can't believe I waited so long to give Tott's a try.  Just a little background on my experience with Chinese food.  My mother was not a great cook and the only time we had anything even remotely resembling Chinese food was when she would crack open a can of that LaChoy Chow Mein.  It.  Was.  Awful.I had to wait until I was in college to get some good Chinese food and a friend took me to Yen Ching's in Waterloo, IA and set me up with sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  Ever since then I've had a serious love affair with mongolian beef, and I'll get sweet and sour chicken if a restaurant does it up with the peppers, onions, and pineapple.  I've discovered over the years that very few places do that any more.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their pictures, I can see that Tott's does it correctly.Right away I was greeted by the employees, and the dude who took my order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered my lunch to dine in, and then an order of pork lo mein to go, to take home for my husband.  The restaurant isn't very big, but it's organized well and very clean.  My order of cheese puffs was so nice and light and the sweet & sour chicken was perfect.  I loved that the owner came around and introduced himself and when I told him I like how they prepared my lunch he said, "Isn't that the way everyone does it?"  Nope.  Absolutely not.  The chicken was lightly breaded and fried and the flavors with the sweet & sour sauce and peppers, onions, and pineapple were delicious.  It tasted like they use a good quality sweet & sour sauce too.  Usually the sauces at most places are very syrupy and sugary, almost like someone did a Red Bull reduction, and I usually get heartburn after eating them.  Not in this case.  The sauce was nicely balanced and so far no heartburn.With the cheese puffs, a fountain soda, the sweet & sour chicken, and the lo mein my total was $20.27 before tax & tip.  Excellent experience all around.  This is food and customer service as good as it gets for sure!  Can't wait to go back!
Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant=Had our service been anything better than pathetically bad, Buca would be a solid 3 stars.  So here's the deal on the service.  I got a coupon in the mail for a free spaghetti with marinara.  That's what brought us in.  But we also ordered two appetizers and an entree to start with.  I commented that I thought the coupon was a nice idea to bring people in (give away a little spaghetti but sell twice that in other menu items).  His response was "yeah, if people are like you and order other stuff, but if they just order spaghetti and water... (insert monotone robotic voice)."  Well, okay then, he should be grateful we didn't do that.Everything we ordered was terribly slow to come.  Kitchen's fault?  Maybe, but we notice where the other servers on the patio are coming and going, our server is rarely seen and when he is around, he's dragging his feet appearing to be on his way to the gas chamber.  Other than taking and delivering our order, he did nothing for us.  While not rude, he was not pleasant or overly friendly either.  The other guys on the patio helped us out with drink refills, clearing plates, etc.  After a long wait at the end of the meal, he returned remarking someone else was supposed to be helping.  We ordered dessert to go, another terrible wait, and asked our food be boxed.  Finally, he brings the dessert and realizes he never brought the leftovers.  Off he shuffles.  Upon returning, he says he's sorry about the wait.  Not half as sorry as he would be upon seeing his tip I'm sure.As for the food, it's good, but nothing outstanding.  Even for family style plates, I think it's slightly overpriced.  When they say a small serves 2-3, that's 2-3 lunch sized portions.  If you're a "healthy" eater, count on 2.  Here's what we ordered:Small garlic bread.  Really good bread slathered in fresh garlic, but $7.99.  Yes, it's a good sized basket, but it's still just garlic bread.  Perhaps bread should be offered at no charge.  Small mozzarella caprese.  Five nice thick slices of tomato with good quality cheese and whole basil leaves.  $9.99 but worth it.Small spaghetti with marinara, normally $9.99 but free.  I would say this serves two for a main dish, three as a side.  Marinara was okay, nothing special.Small chicken parmigiana.  Tasty but overpriced at $17.99 for two breasts IMO.  Remember it does not come with any pasta, just the chicken.Tiramisu.  Best value at $9.95.  It's the size of a small pie and could easily serve four, but I didn't think it was fantastic.  It's a little too "wet," like you could squeeze the cake and get a cup of coffee out of it.We wanted to have a after-lunch drink, but the service turned us off to that.  Might come back, might not.
Julio G's=Still reliably "decent."  Food is just okay in my book.  I don't care for either the red or the green chile or their supposedly "award-winning" tamales, but I am a fan of the tijuana tacos and their guacamole tostadas, the latter mostly because they heap on a ton of guac and I can convince myself they are "heart healthy" and eat it all guilt-free.Pretty bad service tonight for the last half of our meal, but I can't blame the server.  Somehow he got stuck with a table of 8-10, all straggling in separately and indecisive, plus two other tables arriving at the same time.  I actually saw our server running through the restaurant, and I mean running.  Yet, we saw plenty of other employees virtually comatose.  Nice teamwork there.  On the plus side,  my husband was lucky enough to catch a glimpse of Arizona's next parent of the year digging the fruit out of her cocktail and feeding it to her baby.  At least give the baby her own drink.  Geez!Julio G's resides at the very bottom of the barrel when it comes to Mexican food in the valley. From the outside the bright and vividly colored building might make you think that it's some tasty independently owned hole in the wall, but don't fall for the mirage... you're walking into a dungeon of greasy food and bad service. It took about five minutes to completely be turned off by this place. We sat down and were greeted by what had to be one of the most disinterested waitresses I've ever had. She had this vibe going that made us feel like we were inconveniencing her just by being there... her non-descript facial expression and attitude were overshadowed only by her terrible service; which could best be described as 'going through the motions' (even that is giving her too much credit though). Opening the menu yielded even more dissatisfaction... the menu itself was drab and gimmicky and was full of unflattering pictures of the food; making it feel like a chore to even pick out something that looked appetizing. One thing I noticed immediately that should have been a red flag was that for all of their chicken dishes, they charged about three dollars extra for white meat... that's never a good sign. We eventually settled on a chorizo breakfast quesadilla and their sampler platter which included one of just about everything on the menu. The breakfast quesadilla was massive... it must've weighed about three pounds, the taste was okay but it was dripping with grease and after just a few bites it was hard to stomach any more of it. Our other dish; the sampler platter could best be described as a plate of hot garbage. The assortment of food was thrown on the plate and absolutely smothered with cheese... way too much cheese; in fact the plate itself was literally swimming in cheese which almost seemed to be liquefied... more than likely just an artery clogging mixture of melted cheese and grease. The meal was such a grease bomb that we probably ate about 20 percent of it, yet we felt like our stomachs were going to explode when we were done. There is that nice full feeling you get after you eat a well made meal at a good restaurant, then there is that feeling you get after you eat something like Julio G's; that feeling can best be described as 'Where's the toilet?'. To wrap up the lovely meal, the waitress messed up the bill and charged us for both of our drinks even though one of them should have came free with our breakfast quesadilla. At that point though, it was a mute point and we didn't have the energy or patience to try and explain what had happened to her, at risk of causing her brain to short circuit. This is a place I can firmly say I won't be returning to under any circumstance. Julio G's is a poster child for everything a restaurant should NOT be. Bland and boring greasy food, huge portions but zero quality, and a wait staff that you'd swear just woke up from a long nap. To top it all off, the prices are a tad steep for a Mexican restaurant... so basically there's no reason at all to ever try this place. You've been warned... bleh.
El Pollo Supremo=This is one of my favorite Mom and Pop hole in the wall places in Tempe. Some friends told me about this joint and so I decided to come by and see what was smoking. Nice!Very simple inside with some booths to sit at and a counter to order your food. Their menu offers Mesquite Grilled Chicken and some delicious Carne Asada Beef. They also have several yummy sides that you can order as well.There are no fancy this or that items here like some other restaurants. Just very tasty food that is cooked with tender love and care. You can see it in the customer's faces as they arrive for a repeat visit.Usually order the Combo Plate with a side of Beans and several Jalapenos to get my juices flowing. They make the Salsa in house and it combines nicely with the warm tortillas and the beef and chicken. Saw several people buying whole and half chickens and getting them to go.Place can get pretty busy during peak lunch time hours and it is very close to the ASU campus. You may even see some short shorts during your visit. Or what they called hot pants now? GO SUN DEVILS!4 STARS
Jackson's Bar & Grill=Looking for a quick bite on this side of town, Jackson's Bar & Grill came up in my search.  Walking through the bar, the dining area is in the back with day time soaps taking over the television.The Husband ordered their Jack Daniels Tri-Tip Sandwich ($9.99) and it came with your choice of french fries, cole slaw, cup of soup, or side salad.  He opted for the french fries.  He thought the sandwich was pretty tasty and he was happy with his choice.I went for their Chicken Fingers ($6.49), which you can choose how you would like them.  I went for spicy, hoping for some much needed kick.  Unfortunately, it looked like it would be spicy but it definitely was not.  It was more on the mild side of things.  The four fingers came with carrot and celery sticks and their homemade ranch dressing.  It was just average, nothing special.  It looks like the thing to get here is their $6.99 Steak Special though.  "A 9 oz steak, choice of fries, slaw, or rings, steamed veggies and a dinner salad, all for ONLY $6.99, 24 hours a day. Groups are welcome."  All that for $6.99 and served all day sounds like a pretty good deal to me! They also still accept the Entertainment Book coupon!$6.99 steak dinner special means I don't have to schlep it to Ellis Island if I want a cheap steak fix..which I haven't had in 2 years but still...I got a $20 match play coupon in the mail for my birthday here and they offer $10 match play coupons on the back of the Flamingo and Decatur Smith's supermarket reciepts.  So my wife and I go and the bartender just puts a $20 in my machine..lets my wife use 2 coupons so she has $20 in free play now.  I also had a buy one get one free entree coupon to top it all off.My wife orders the cheeseburger which was just ok but I get the steak dinner which is a pretty sweet deal for all the stuff you get.  This is quality late night drunken food for sure!!  7 drinks later, I end up hitting quad aces and quad 5's in back to back hands and my wife hits a ten high diamond straight flush on her machine!!  First time either of us had ever hit those high hands in our limited video poker experience.Drinks were comped for our play, dinner comes out to $9 and we cash out for $100.  Pretty fn great!!!After a great dinner with the "family", we walked a few doors down to have a few drinks at Jackson's. It seems like the past few months of my life have been tolerable thanks to alcohol...and I'm not a drinker.This is a locals Green Bay Packers bar. So, I was a little confused why there aren't any cheesehead decor in the bar but there was a harpoon of all things. This place is pretty big.The women's restroom is quite disgusting. Only 2 stalls: regular and handicap. The regular one was filthy and I had to use 3 toilet seat covers to relieve myself and the flush didn't work! The other times I went to the bathroom, I had to use the handicap stall which was much better and cleaner.BUUUUUT our server was fantastic. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink so she let me try stuff and she was accurate with the description of flavor profiles of drinks. She would chat with us from time to time. However, we found it quite peculiar when she asked me if I wanted a cold glass. I want a volcanic glass that would spew hot beer please! She's still good in my book though. Magic Hat #9 and Stella Artois FTW!Ok so I have fallen in love with Jackson's bar & grill on Flamingo and Jones for many great reasons!Why you say...? Well it is easy to love because first of all the Service is Amazing, and that means a lot to Yelpers like myself. There are way too many spots to visit in LV so why would we go where the service is bad? Exactly and that is why I am now a loyal and now semi regular patron of Jackson's.The food is another reason I visit because they have a menu that is one of the best in town for a bar and grill. This last visit I had ordered the mild chicken strips appetizer because I had remembered how good it was the last time I went!I also decided on the Jalapeno poppers to split with a friend and what a great choice that was! These were filled with cream cheese and had the best batter on them, possibly like panko fried to a golden brown! This dish also comes with a delicious sweet chili sauce which was a nice addition to the already growing mouth orgasm I was in the middle of.I will have to try their prime rib special sometime because every time I go I am informed by other customer's that they have a very very very good prime rib din din!I will have to try it because if I recall a customer who was sitting next to made me promise her I would try it next time lol.  I can't go back on a promise, so...lolOk so now that I have confirmed that the service and food is truly fabulous. Let's get to the Bar which is why we come in the first place for a nice drinky drink...right? BARTENDER BILLY IS THE BEST!I go on Thursday nights to meet my friends at midnight because we get to see Billy who is the most Awesome bartender around. His drinks are yummy, he has a fantastic personality and his bar skills and great attitude can't be beat!I have stopped by the last three Thursdays in a row, I am slowly becoming a regular and who do I have to thank for that...Billy lol.Jackson's is Awesome and if I could kiss the Owners I would because they knocked this one out of the ball park!Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sautéed onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!Mmmm yum yes I say as always! Jackson's is the go to spot for an Amazing Bartender, great food and overall fun!They have my favorite game, Cleopatra Keno which is fun to play while enjoying the night!My friends and I always hit up Jackson's at midnight when the best bartender (Billy) in all of Las Vegas starts his shift. The food is Amazing, I could close my eyes and just point at the menu and know that whatever it is will be delicious!I am a forever loyal fan.Come on down and see what all of the fuss is about! :)It says it's been 19 days since I wrote my last review. That's the longest I've done that in a while.  Let's see if I still know how to do this.Ah Jackson's Bar and Grill. I've always known of Jackson's, pass it all the time but never went. It's your typical neighborhood bar/restaurant. The food ain't fancy or amazing but it's good for what it is.  This is a Packers bar so when it's the NFL season you know what's up. Solid 3.25 stars.I had a serious craving for a steak and remembered Roger T. talking about the 16 oz rib eye deal here. Well after I got here I was hit by a dilemma, it was a Monday and there was also a 16 oz prime rib deal. Hmm do I have the 16 oz prime rib for $11.99 or the 16 oz rib eye for $12.99 how about both!?I already had my mind set on the rib eye before coming here so I had to get it. For the price the rib eye wasn't that bad. I ordered a medium well and got more well done but I had no complaints there other then it being a little tough. I still ate it. It still taste good enough to get again. It came with some brussel sprouts and a baked potato, which were both kind of meh. It's a pretty good deal for a steak meal offered 24/7. I also ordered a lobster bisque soup, kinda too salty but edible. Another Monday I was craving steak again and said PRIME RIB. It was OK again kind of overcooked and dry had to really use the au jus for it but it satisfied my craving for meat that day. They actually ran out and I  had gotten the last one, it was barely 5:30pm on prime rib special night. Prime rib is offered pretty much everywhere in town. I wouldn't say I was a fan of the prime rib but I'd eat it again maybe ask for it more rare.The rest of menu ain't that bad. There's more meat dishes, it has "Grill" in it's name, sandwiches, burgers, breakfast, etc. What stands out besides the 16 oz prime rib and 16 oz rib eye has to also be the 20 oz ham and eggs for $9.99, the 1 lbs rib eye and eggs, and whatever they had on the 24/7 menu, which I may come back for. The staff is friendly but they seemed understaffed.  It's been pretty busy both times I was there. There's a bar area which can hold decent number of people, a separate restaurant area which can hold more people, and another area away from the bar where there's a 82 inch TV and a comfortable chair right in front which I fell asleep in after eating two 16 oz meals each time I was here. Real chill place with a pretty good 2 pitchers of PBR for $10 deal offered 24/7.Roger we should watch the first game of the season here Packers vs Seahawks haha.I have been coming to Jackson's Bar & Grill for some time...maybe 4 years now.  I used to be a semi regular on Tuesday nights (Backgammon Tournament) but haven't been impressed with the service or food.  I have been postponing doing a review hoping it would return to what I remembered from years ago...but alas it has not.My most recent visit was a Monday night for the prime rib.  The portions are very generous, but the food quality is just good at best.  The prime rib was ordered medium, but originally served raw, not rare but RAW.  My friend who prefers it rare even commented that it was too rare for even HIM.  Two trips back to the kitchen later the prime rib had at least stopped mooing and I decided to just keep it.  The mash potatoes and gravy was served separately and now cold as the beer.  Now... beer was good and cold so that is a plus!The dining area is somewhat separated from the bar area, but the smoke definitely makes its way back to the dining area.  I wish I would have at least posted a review with 3 Stars prior, but now I have to go with just 2 Stars and I seriously doubt I will be back to try it again, but you never know.I have been to Jackson's many of times, I would consider myself a semi regular and a big fan of bartender Billy!I stopped by for an early morning visit to have breakfast and play some Cleopatra keno.A new cook has joined the Jackson's family and his name is Dave! He prepared my breakfast this morning and it was delicious! I ordered one of their breakfast plates, eggs (scrambled) hashed browns and sourdough toast. ($5.29) Wow, I must say this was one of the best breakfast meals I have had dining out in a long while. My eggs were cooked perfectly, hashed browns nice and golden, and the best sourdough bread ever toasted to perfection! Their breads are tasty, wow, I don't recall a time when I have enjoyed sourdough toast as much as I did this morning!I have to give a butt bump and a high five to Dave for making an awesome breakfast! I am happy that he is a part of their team because from what I have tasted he can throw down in the kitchen!I love Jackson's, you Rock!
Sacks Art of Sandwicherie=This place is Amazing!!! *** I LOVE THEIR SANDWICHES THUS FAR!!!! "The Michelangelo "  was one of the the most incredible sandwiches that I have had in my life!!! I wish I could remember everything that it had, but that doesn't matter because you should try them out yourself!!! This place is great!!! Truly Great!!! YUM, YUM!!! :)_ Okay let me be super honest, I feel the need to express my most sincere thoughts about this place. If I could give them a ZERO star review I would!   I really liked this place before, the service used to be good, just chill natural treatment, the hidden/sneaky location, and let's not forget the vibe and the out of the ordinary sandwiches they offer, yet tasty.   However my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely. I do not plan on ever visiting this sandwich location again, maybe a different spot with a better care for customer satisfaction, but definitely not this location.  On my visit here, it was about 10:30 a.m., with no traffic, at least not as busy as normal peak hours for breakfast/lunch.   Yet, they managed to take 15+ minutes to prepare a sandwich. I would like to add that by the looks as when I came into this establishment they had a full kitchen staff, as well as helping staff at the registers. Still they managed to take that long to make my sandwich, and I honestly think that they forgot my order, but they failed to recognize that, I asked the girl at the register, who by the way was insanely rude If she still had my order for, "The Perfect Storm" which was their special hot sandwich for the day, she said yes, but first asked me again for my name, as well as to remind her what I had ordered.    I then figured that she had forgotten my order, and I believe they did because the people behind me and those behind them after my order were getting called for their sandwiches and I was still there waiting.    I don't understand why they feel like they can take all the time they please to make a sandwich and then not even give a simple apology recognizing their mistake.  That apology would have made it much better, word of advice, just show a little more consideration next time please.   I was in no big rush, yet I could be doing better things with my time other than checking back on my sandwich order to make sure they didn't forget it. Then after all that mess the sandwich was not what  I expected it to be, way too much cheese and oil. Sorry not my style nor taste. The board clearly advertised a Grilled Turkey, Melted Swiss Cheese, Sautéed Mushrooms & Red Bell Pepper, Tomato, Romaine Lettuce, Honey Mustard, and On a Toasted Baguette. Sounds tasty and healthy right, not the case for this baguette.* TOTAL Dissatisfaction *Terrible service by the girl at the register *Not up to par sandwich -Good reasons why to never ever come back. - Oh and terrible tea!!
China Town Buffet=I wasn't quite sure what to make of this place...The food was fine, but it was the people...THE PEOPLE!As a girl gamer who keeps her inner geek firmly behind closed doors (until now!), I didn't know what to make of the table full of guys were dining there prior to their WoW (World of Warcraft) raid."Hurry up, man. We have to leave. Raid starts in forty five mins.""Chill, dude. We're only around the corner from the house.""My internet and wifi connection might have to be re-booted.""My hunter needs blah blah blah..."I tuned out and decided to focus on my food and surroundings. The restaurant itself is a bit rundown, but the tables and chairs were clean, even if the napkin dispenser on the table wasn't. I didn't feel itchy like I have in some places. So I was quite all right with the cleanliness. I did have issues with people not having "buffet etiquette" - using the same plate to go back to the buffet line, picking with their fingers to get at food when there are tongs there, using a spoon in the tray to not only get the food from that specific tray, but to reach and get the stuff next to it because you're too lazy to put the spoon down and use the properly allocated one? boo to you! I think it just came from living in Vegas and hitting the buffets with family and friends when they'd roll into town - Vegas was pretty strict and they had no qualms in telling you to get a fresh plate and to not cross contaminate the utensils. Anyway, I digres...It's rare to eat at a Chinese buffet that isn't greasy...and this wasn't greasy. The selection was pretty big and the fruit was so good! I was really taken by surprise by this whole place - food was fresh and actually good! They didn't use MSG and they didn't douse everything with soy sauce and salt.But...I was enjoying my food until...a biiiiig girl in a tiiiiiiny denim miniskirt with the words "Delicious" embroidered on the back part of her butt bent over and...much to my horror and chagrin, showed me a cat I did not care to see. It looked so ANGRY!My eyes welled up with tears and my friend thought I was choking until she followed my line of sight. "OH DEAR GOD!!!!" was all she could say. Even the gamers were rendered speechless. It was a total bonding moment between our two tables.What has been seen cannot be unseen.Oh dear God indeed.Indeed.
Ruth's Chris Steak House=What can I say ~ I Love Ruth's Chris!From the moment I walked in I was waited on with the utmost attention.I made a reservation for some friends and I.I arrived early so I sat at the bar and ordered some calamari(see pics)PJ the bartender took very good care of me, he was funny without being obnoxious, we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers, he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have! I found a new favorite.(Whitehall Lane Cabernet)He was great company while I waited for my guests to arrive. Thanks PJ~Dinner was Delicious as usual, although I did notice they increased their prices a bit.I ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Ruth's Chop salad, Seared Scallops and the broccoli augratin. (see pics) I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater.My guests ordered the filet and crab legs, tomato salad, house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well.After dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in (see pics)I spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~Huh. I guess it's a love it or hate kind of place. Me? I love it. But put butter on a shoe and I might just kiss you. Oh butter, is there anything you can't do? Is there?This is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss.It's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat. I know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection. The service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye. Oh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. "Hold the butter." May save you some pain.One of my business partners came to town and suggested that we get a steak for dinner. He went ahead and made a ressie for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and since he was buying, he got to choose. We walked in on time for our 7:00 pm reservation to be told that they weren't ready for us yet...in a half empty restaurant. I was puzzled, but it seemed to be a ploy, more than anything else, to get us into the bar for a cocktail, before we went into the restaurant for...a cocktail.The service was, in a single well chosen word...perfunctory. Our waiter went through the motions and didn't seem particularly pleased with Ruthies or with us. None of the staff seemed up and happy. Nobody was really smiling or friendly, and every phrase, every question, every move seemed designed to "optimize" us. Every word sounded like it came out of the corporate server manual.The food was OK. If you put enough butter on anything, you can make it taste pretty good, and they put some  butter on them there steaks, let me tell you! The wine list is fine...I don't have the palate for fine pinot's that my partner does, but he found something from Oregon that he liked and you can't really screw up MacCallan's, neat:)After the initial enforced 20 minute wait for nothing, we were assembly lined through dinner in an hour. How very efficient! :)If it seems that I am being tough on Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, it's only because I am. You know, when I spend (OK, I didn't spend a dime, dinner was on my partner and believe me when I tell you I deserved to be treated to a free dinner) $250 for 2 people, I want to see the love from everybody in the place, from the minute I walk in the door, through bringing the ice water and the MacCallan's, to perfection in the art of appetizer's, entrée's, desserts and coffee. I see the love in other places (both considerably more expensive and significantly less expensive, so it's not a case of me just being crabby about pricey dinner spots:), and it just doesn't come shining through here.I just don't get that anybody really gives a crap at Ruthies'. I'm probably wrong, and everybody cares about us, "the valued customer", like the very dickens. As far as Ruthie's being a chain, so we should expect the corporate approach, well...I see chains where the service is caring and enthusiastic, even if they are serving double-doubles and a coke for $5.45, not steak and scotch for $100+ per, and the fresh faces smiling at me aren't making a $50 tip on my dinner, either. So I know it can be done...and should be done:)BTW, clear up the confusion for me...I know who "Ruth" is, but who or what is her "Chris"?While I tend to avoid chains, this was a gift certificate we needed to spend. Luckily Ruth's Chris does not feel like a chain - the manager is very much in charge and passionate about his work, as are all the employees.We had an amazing dinner here last night. From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs. The waiter (Francisco) was also a seasoned wine pro - he helped us pick the perfect wine and even took the time to recommend and write down some store bought Pinot Noirs we might enjoy later. The steak here is perfection. Aged, prime meat served on a 500 degree plate with butter. This is right up there with Morton's, Donovan's, and Flemming's! She tried the Steak and Lobster and while the lobster was very good - stick with steak!The staff all pitched in to keep my diet coke full. Excellent teamwork!In summary: at $100 a person they earn every penny!- Sorry you caught them on a bad night Donald!09/14/10My first visit to Ruth Chris' and I have to say "not bad, not bad at all!"  I really liked the subdued atmosphere- white-clothed tables, yet not too stuffy, intimate bar area, but still allowed for personal space; and music set to very low (great for conversation or working w/ a laptop).  Bartender was not too aloof, yet eager to answer any question when I had any.  Have you had a chance to look over Ruth Chris' HH (happy hour) menu, yet?  There's a lot to choose from!  Now that I think of it, I'm surprised I haven't been back since.  After studying the menu for many minutes, I decided I'd try the burger, which I'd like to say was $12 (or was it $9?).  Whatever the cost, it was worth it!Perfectly-grilled and juicy eight-ounce patty, topped w/ a GENEROUS amount of blue cheese, some partially-melted (oh my!), on top of a buttered and grilled bun.  The burger also came w/ lovely and superbly-crisped fries!  Not a soggy one in the bunch, which was great in the short-term, but not-so-great for me in the long-term (so many extra calories I'd normally be saving by ditching soggy fries!  LOL).  A must-order entree!BTW, I tried a little of the complimentary sourdough table bread and butter while waiting for my meal- crusty, good stuff!I have been to the Scottsdale Ruth's Chris several times for happy hour on the patio.  The view is amazing.  The problem is the service!Last week my friend and I sat on the patio for 20 minutes as the wait staff walked around, ignoring us.  When we finally ordered our drinks (which we had picked from the website happy hour menu) we were told that those were not on the happy hour menu...the waitress had no intention of honoring the website list, nor discussing it.  When our food came, my sliders were very dry...I waited for the waitress to come back around, so I could ask for mustard.  I waited...and waited...and waited....   Finally, I got up and asked the hostess to please get me some mustard.  Through the evening, I ended up asking the hostess for mustard, more water, and the bill because our waitress was missing in action.We didn't decide to go to a local haunt for a drink, nor did we decide to go to a mega-chain restaurant.....we chose the upscale spot, payed the upscale prices and expected an upscale experience, which we did not get!!!
Bagel Gourmet=Always fresh love the teriyaki chicken with veggies. And customer service is on point
Frank & Lupe's Old Mexico=I hadn't been to Frank & Lupe's for more than a year when I met a potential client there for lunch today.I don't embarrass easily...just look at the fact that I post my actual picture on my Yelp profile. I come from stout Norwegian stock (you want to talk about an internal compass that is seldom right but never uncertain and always unconcerned, it's the good Norwegian wood - gratuitous Beatles reference - that I spring from).But, jeez, I was embarrassed today!I remember this place as being better than this! Do I have early onset "old-timers" disease? Is my fondness for happy hours just the beginnings of a craving for "early bird specials"? I don't know.I got there a few minutes early and was seated and got chips and salsa (both the regular and the hot..I like the hot, but you never know about other peoples taste). So far so good...decent chips and decent salsa, although I seem to remember the chips being warm the last time I was here.It went downhill from there. My lunch meeting arrived and we chatted as we waited for our server to come and take her drink order...and waited...and waited. He finally looked at us (could it have been my frantic waving?), and dropped by the table to find out what all the fuss was about. Took her drink order and asked what we wanted  for lunch. We hadn't decided and that earned us a sniff and spin, and off he went. Another server brought her drink and we looked at the menu's while we talked business and waited for our server to return...and waited...and waited.I just want to iterate that it just wasn't that busy today...maybe 12-15 total tables, in and out, with 3 servers, so not a heavy load. Our server finally returned after another stint of waving (I had my workout this morning, but I got in a little extra upper body at F&L). He took our orders and we waited...and waited.My fish taco's came out, and we waited for my lunch companions Holy Mole'...and waited...and waited. 5 minutes and I motioned to him (less waving this time...he was looking anxiously between us and the kitchen by now). I asked him to take my order back to the kitchen and keep it warm until both orders could be brought out together...he didn't. Instead he said the mole was coming right out, which it did (if by "right out" he meant 4 minutes from now).This might have all been OK, if the food had been what I thought I remembered...it wasn't...it was worse...way worse.The fish in the taco's was not fresh...little tiny chunks of fish that clearly came out of a can. I tried all three tacos, and there was some variation in the flavors, but not from the fish.The mole may have been worse. I don't know, but for someone who was looking forward to the mole to give up after a half dozen bites was not a good sign.You know, it's never a good idea to have a prospective business relationship see you switch into full jerk mode over something as trivial as a crappy lunch (although I was sorely tempted), so I paid the bill, we continued our conversation and I will probably not get to pick the restaurant the next time we dine together. But it was a successful lunch in the business sense.I try to "vote local" with my dining and entertainment dollars, and I don't expect perfection, but could some of these places at least try? Canned fish in the tacos...really?!?!?! I don't think my memory is faulty...I think it was better, and I know I was looking forward to having lunch there today.Jeez...this was embarrassing!Yowza, if I could give this spot -5 stars, I would.As mentioned in earlier reviews, service is truly non-existent.  It's quite remarkable at the level of 'who gives a crap' that is on display here.I took a co-worker there for a holiday lunch, as she has a dish there she is crazy about. We arrive at one, and are seated right away. Drinks get to us eventually and we are able to order. My friend ordered a house special, and I ordered steak fajitas.While waiting for lunch to arrive, our drinks ran dry, and we also ran out of chips. While the restaurant was slow, with only a handful of tables occupied- the service was still a complete disaster. The wait staff was five feet away behind the bar hanging out, not paying any attention to anything.Eventually our food arrives, and they must have invented a new strain of white beef, because my steak fajitas are white and look like chicken nuggets, only drier. I asked our befuddled server if I was looking at chicken, and he smiled and replied that it was. I reminded him that I ordered steak, at which point he made a gas face. There was no attempt at service delivery, making it right, etc. To end the silent standoff, I told him I would just give the chicken a go.I am really laid back, and I like chicken, so I thought it might taste okay. As it turned out, the chicken was SO dry, and it was shaped like chicken nuggets. I have never seen chicken shaped like that, that was not part of  a meal you order at a drive thru. Moving past the shape, they were dry and truly tasteless. To replicate this dish, you would need old chicken, no flavor, and a hatred for the people you were cooking for.Wrapping up the cluster that was our lunch, my friend ordered some takeout to bring back to her co-worker. We waited for another 20 minutes and no one ever showed up at our table, so I went to the bar and asked about our bill and takeout. Finally I was able to pay and get the takeout bag, which I gave to my pal. I jokingly told her to check it and make sure it wasn't screwed up too, and she did. *** Spoiler alert, they messed up the takeout too. It was completely wrong. I brought the container to the server who replied with "Wow, everything is messed up." Cheers to you, good sir- we agree!While they went to fix it, I saw inside the kitchen, and it was pretty dirty. I can truly say that was my last and final trip to Frank and Lupe's. The food isn't terrible, but the service, price point, and utter lack of giving a shite make it a no go for me. There clearly is no one there to manage the business and ensure that people are being cared for, and that quality control is happening. Do yourself a favor and find another spot.  Hell, at this point Taco Bell on Thomas & Scottsdale is a better option. At least you know going into it that the food will be mediocre.in the order i noticed things:1.dirty, sticky wall2. large amount of ants crawling around the floor3. my carne asada tasted like hamburger meat4. FRESH lipstick on my cupI wish i could have noticed our waiter, but he was never anywhere to be found. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
McDonald's=It's your average McDonald's.  Fast service, average fast food.  I was running around and needed a quick lunch, so I went through the drive through and ordered 2 McDouble's from the value menu the other day.  It's a McDonald's, so my expectations aren't high...Not bad for less than $2.50.Return Factor - 50%This cafe is not a safe place for studying or getting any business work done. Do not come here if you plan on staying longer than a half hour - even as a paying customer.Today, while studying material for medical school, I was kicked out and asked not to come back. Apparently, I was there for too long. In my experience, Cafe and free wi-fi is to attract students/business persons to come, buy their product, study/work, and buy more product. The owner has informed me that no customer, paying or not, is allowed to stay at their facility for longer than a half hour.The owner also informed me that my family was not to use the PlayPlace for longer than a half hour - even if we made purchases every half hour.If you plan on studying/working, go to to another cafe. I stay at the Starbuck's across the street for hours on end and it seems to "fit with their business plan".  Of course, I nor my fellow students, have ever had a problem in any other cafe/restaurant that advertises free wi-fi. According to the owner, this is always bad business.For the business owner's "education"; http://www.yelp.com/topic/chicago-studying-at-cafe-etiquette , http://starbucksgossip.typepad.com/_/2009/09/do-you-care-if-a-computeruser-sits-in-your-store-all-day-nursing-one-cup-of-coffee.html, https://theinnocentlam.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/lifestyle-studying-in-starbucks-how-long-is-too-long/, https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100317141150AAshluO. Applicable to "McCafe"
Blue Adobe Grille=I was a little weary about coming here, because for some reason in my head I was thinking it was a Baja Fresh/Rubios type place, boy was I wrong.Most importantly, I think they made me the freshest squeezed margarita I've ever had. I also ordered some food, the delicious Adobo Pulled Pork sandwich, and guess what, it came with fries AND onion rings! I hate having to choose. Other than our entire experience being positive, the only thing I'd say could use some help is maybe the decor. Kinda bland, the bar is the best part, we didn't hang out inside much since we sat on the patio, so maybe some more plants on the patio to block the view of the parking lot.My friend lives way out East. North East that is. Scottsdale on the boarder of Fountain Hills. This is one of her favorite places to go. I have never been till this visit.I drove out there to find it quite easily in a nice spacious parking lot. It is beautifully decorated inside and out.A nice man opened the door for me as I came up and said Teresa, we have been waiting for you. My friend told him she was waiting for me. But, it made me laugh. He escorted me to the booth where she waiting.  The server came right away and offered me a drink. I chose water and coffee. She said ,I will make you a fresh pot. Which she did and I always greatly appreciate that.We both got the special of the day, Fish and Chips. They were wonderful!Big pieces of cod lightly breaded and nice FF. Along with a side of fresh cole slaw made with apples. Since it was 107 outside it was divine. Our service was wonderful, she refilled our water and the other drinks always on time.When it is cooler outside it would be nice to sit on the patio. It looked lovely. The ladies room was also, clean and nice.I would definitely come back again.
Thai Spice=I stopped here for lunch the other day. The lunch specials were $7.25 so I ordered the Pepper Steak. The lady asked what level spice I wanted it so I tried level 8. The pepper steak had great flavor but I would go for level 10 next time since it could have been spicier for my taste. The meal started with a soup that I just thought was okay and a salad that I didn't try. The egg roll and rice that came with my pepper steak was real good.Service was good and the food came out quick. The price was right and portion of food good so I will stop by for lunch again.
Omelet House=We passed this spot many many times & never stopped. One of our friends mentioned the pumpkin bread is awesome so we decided to stop for brunch. Can I just say that we are a bunch of IDIOTS for passing this place up.*on our knees* "We humbly apologize Omelet House, please forgive us for our breakfast snobby-ish attitude."Lets  start with the exterior. Its very 1970-ish and its in between a storage property and a McD's right on Boulder Hwy. They have a huge yellow Omelet House sign towering over the bldg with another sign in the front that says "the home of the 3 lb burger." The interior decor was like a country diner, nothing fancy.It was pretty empty @ 11:30am (we aren't complaining) there were a couple families and a bunch of metro police officers. I believe that policemen know all the good eats around town and they were coming in and out of Omelete house...a good very good sign. The service was excellent. We got greeted and got our drinks...double quick. Our waitress Gina was very friendly and kept our drinks filled. She took our order and our food came out pretty quick. They have a wide range of menu items. We ordered the:-Homemade corned beef hash, potato fries, eggs up. The potato fries are different and addicting. Hash was ONO- it had more corned beef than potatoes ...my kind of hash.-Philly cheese chicken sandwich w sauteed mushroom & onions. My wife loved the taste of it but said she'll ask for light cheese.-We had to order a pancake just to try it, since they did sell a single pancake for $2.39. I like it like that- sometimes its a waste of money to order a short stack. Pancake was nice and fluffy, perfect golden brown.-We also ordered both  of the pumpkin and banana nut bread...they were both very good. I give the nod to the pumpkin bread.They also have the 3 lb burger challenge or a 12 egg omelette (we'll leave the challenges to Chestnut & Kobayashi).This is one of those joints that you don't judge a book by its a cover. They are only opened from 6am to 3pm, so don't delay...plan your next breakfast here and you won't be disappointed. if you aren't happy with their food...then you can pleasure your simple palette right next door at those golden arches. Aloha!!!
Fuddruckers=Apparently the original name was Fuckrudder's but for some reason that didn't take off. So a few multi million dollar advertising meetings later, waaa laa, Fuddrucker's. Ahhh, c'mon, it's still fun to say. Now, is it fun to eat here? Well, back in it's hey day, I thought it was pretty fun. Design your own burger. Grab a beer. Chow down. However, the last time I ate at Fuddrucker's, it was a sad sight. The "burger bar" was a disaster. Nothing really interesting for toppings. Except for the artificial nacho cheese sauce perhaps. And what was there was picked over like the last bologna wrapped pickle at a trailer park picnic. And speaking of trailer parks, even though this particular Fuckrudder's, ooops, er um, I mean Fuddrucker's is in tony Scottsdale, the clientele was, was, well they scared me.
Fatburger=What I want to know is who the hell puts sweet relish on a burger? Especially a burger that already has dill pickles.. I mean I love pickles as much as the next asshole, but I fn HATE sweet relish, so it pretty much ruined the whole thing. Aside from that, my curly fries were perfect, and they have Cherry Coke.. so here, have 2 stars.Ive been here twice... in the same week.(guilty....) the first time i walked in and it smelt heavenly!! i could smell the grills smoking away :) i love the retro interior... the silver and white tables and walls... i guess us blondes just like shiny things... who knows... i ordered a regular burger and a drink... the service was quick and orderly... i liked that there was a lot of room for people to wait and for those of us already seated don't have to have butts in our faces while we try to eat... that's a perk for sure... the location isn't to bad either... and like i said its huge for being a burger joint on such a busy street.... the Second time i went i had the turkey burger.... it was AMAZING!!!!!!! it didn't make me feel like i wished i hadn't .... it tasted in some ways better... and my favorite part of these delicious burgers is that they put RELISH on them as well and PICKLES!!!!! yum!!!! if i could... i would so eat here everyday.... mmmmmmmmmmmmm ::drooling::My first Fatburger experience! Check that one off my cheeseburgers list.I was properly warned that it takes quite awhile to get the food, and man were my advisors correct. We pulled up to the drive-thru at around 4 pm and didn't get our food until about 4:27. But that's because they make it fresh, to-order so you're not getting burgers or fries that have been sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long. And yes, you can taste the freshness in the product. Burger was good, fries were even better but the star of the meal had to be the strawberry shake. Cold, creamy and full of berry goodness... it hit the spot on a hot, Vegas afternoon. Normally I don't drink the entire thing, no matter how good, 'cause that's a lot of dairy in one sitting. This time, I absolutely drank it all. Fatburger would likely be in my Top 10 all-time burger experiences. It's good and a special treat since we don't have them in the Bay Area. But my heart still stays true to Krekel's Custard in Central IL.
Panda Express=What is it with this place?  Since moving to the valley over 18 months ago my daughters have been enamored with this place.  Actually it is starting to wane, thank God.How are these things all over the place?  Can't we make them get back to the mall food courts where they belong?  They are the McDonald's of Chinese food aren't they?  When I lived back east we didn't let these McChinese places get out of hand.  Valley residents have obviously not put them in their place in the scheme of things.Bad Chinese food fast!c'mon bro. you know i had to eat here. but they had the skimpiest menu ever. had maybe like 4 items. wtf. service was good as usual for panda. and this place was large but their items weak. where is my chicken and potato or chicken and string beans??
Bagel Nosh=It was Sat morning and I was with my friend and we were headed to the dog park and said hey lets grab a bite to eat, so we stopped at Bagel Nosh. I love bagels, so why not!This was my 1st time at a bagel nosh and I have to say, what a nice selection of bagels they have to offer. I picked out a jalapeno & cheese bagel that was still warm from the oven and jalapeno cream cheese. Like I said the bagel was still warm and the cream cheese really surprised me, they have whole slices of jalapenos in the cream cheese, that right there was the bomb!  Delish I tell you!  Fresh bagels & great cream cheese perfectly paired together!
Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse=Holy bull riding batman! Here are some updates since my last review. Be sure to visit Buffalo Chip Saloon on Friday nights. The professional live bull riding makes it worth the drive, trust me. Since my last visit, they've built an entirely new edition to the Saloon where they serve the famous BBQ buffet. It's very nice and makes for a good place to sit and eat! I just love it here. This place is definitely what you would think AZ looks like if you lived elsewhere and had never been to Arizona, but sometimes even the locals need a little tourist social night in their life!Go on Wedesdays or Fridays!  Its quite a hike up to Cave Creek but its worth it :)  Real bull riding and its PACKED full of people. Everyone in Cave Creek and their grandma is at Buffalo Chips.  The place itself is huge with a dance floor, restaurant area, multiple bars, arm wrestling station (hilarious), outdoor eating areas, outdoor bars, rodeo area.... and its right around a bunch of other bars within walking distance (some are very 'biker' bar'ish' so beware but try Harold's Corral next door)  The rodeo is AWESOME and they apparently have amateur night which is somewhat shocking to me... but maybe they put you on a little pony or in a full suite of armor ;)    Great western crowd... more cowboy hat and boot wearing folk than I've ever seen in one place!  In my book you are a winner if you even attempt the arm wrestling machine.... that thing is freakishly strong and makes you feel like a wimp. Live country music is fantastic and everyone is out there dancing and swinging around! SO MUCH FUN! Dancing really is the best part of 'nightlife' in my book and I totally loved the country western dancing at Buffalo Chips.  WARNING:  DO NOT PARK ON THE STREET EVEN IF EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT.  Those Cave Creek patrollers are nasty and I got a whopping $200+ parking ticket as did the other 12+ cars on the street.  You've been warned yelpers! *This is why I have to give four stars... the cruel and unusual parking ticket left a sour taste in my mouth*I have to disagree with folks who say this place is touristy. Granted, this is THE place to take your out-of-town visitors. Last time I was here we had a friend from Australia and she was over-the-moon at her first real American experience. So yes, a lot of out-of-towners. But you CAN'T tell me that the folks tearing up the dance floor on any given Friday are your Uncle Murray and Aunt Sybil visiting from Boca.This is a fun place with a nice old west feel. They have great live music, the afore mentioned dancing, reasonably priced drinks, pool tables, a HUGE patio....and as others have mentioned, LIVE bull riding. I really need to come here more often because it is one of the funnest places in The Valley and you really feel like you're away from it all. Yes it gets uber-crowded, the line to the men's room is a long as the line to the ladies room and you're really kinda screwed if you really came here to play pool, but if there is ANY place you should take it all in stride, it's here.And seriously folks, quit bitching about the food. It's a $20 steak for God's sake. You get what you pay for and frankly it's pretty damned good-better than Outback or Applebee's. If that's not good enough then go to Mastro's and bring your own bull.Good times and I highly recommend.
Chens Chinese Food=My youngest daughter chose Chen's for our "date night" restaurant.  Every couple weeks I go out one-on-one with one of the kids, my wife with the other and we switch off.  Make sure we get some one on time with each of them.  They pick the restaurant (within reason).So we ordered fried wonton's by mistake (our mistake, we meant to order crab rangoon, didn't see that and ordered the first thing that sounded similar without reading thoroughly) and it was OK.  Fried wonton filled with pork and scallion.We also ordered the chicken fried rice.  Again, OK.  Nothing special, basic Chinese fried rice.  Safe.When it came to an entree' I said "Why don't we try something more interesting."  My daughter said "OK", and ordered sweet and sour chicken.  It was then it occurred to me that my kids have possibly never had sweet and sour chicken because we (and they for the most part) shy away from the standard fare at Chinese restaurants.Anyway, the sweet and sour chicken was also OK.  Oddly, a few of the peppers were cold as if thrown into the chicken at the last second.  Portions were good, there were plenty of leftovers.  The food was such that the leftovers have only a 50/50 chance of actually being eaten...Basically 2.5 star fare.
Bonito Michoacan=As I was searching for another authentic Mexican food spot to try out, I decided to give this spot a try since the reviews were great. The service was great from entering the restaurant by being greeting by the hostess and didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was very friendly and always checked up on us and right away we were served with chips, salsa, and beans. The salsa was okay I just wish it was more fresh than watery. I ordered the guacamole since everyone recommended it and it was delicious. You get to pick what you don't want in it because they make it in front of you. I went with the steak ranchero for dinner since I felt like some steak. I have to say it was made to my liking' not too salty and not too dry. Can't wait to come back here and try another dish!Was in Vegas for a friend's birthday weekend and looking for a place to go eat brunch/lunch at and one of our friends mentioned Bonito Michoacan, we all thought it sounded great so off we went!When I got there, I check in on my handy dandy Yelp App and guess what! Just checking in I scored a free margarita, how sweet is that!  But they also had a little text promo too that gave you a free margarita as well, so the table of 12 was already set with free margarita haha.They start you off with homemade chips, bean dip & salsa, the bean dig is great, mix it with the salsa and it becomes amazing!  Just take note, 1st round of homemade chips, bean dip & salsa are complementary, additional orders are 2.99, but we were a party of 12 and there was plenty.After checking out the menu I went with Zitacuaro - 2 enchiladas in a Verde sauce, I picked chicken for my meat, and I have to say these enchiladas were great, the corn tortilla I believe was homemade, it was perfectly cooked, the chicken was shredded and it was moist and very good tasting, however they season/marinade the chicken was delish! The Verde sauce was delish too! One of the best I have had, full of flavor and the perfect texture. These were some great enchiladas.Service was great and friendly, glad to have found this lil gem in Vegas!
Elmer's Tacos=Pretty much what everyone else said.  Excellent food, cheap prices, no-frills atmosphere.  Easily the best tacos I have had here in AZ, perhaps CA also.  They use good ingredients, high quality meat, excellent corn tortillas.  I didn't try to go during lunch when school is in session, I could imagine it would be a nightmare being right across the street from a High School.Right around the corner from my sister's ghetto-tastic shack, this place is bomb. Green chile tostada...hell yes! The place is not much to look at from the outside, not much to savor on the inside, but the only people hanging out here are Chandler High kids escaping 4th period. You stand in line, you get your paper bag of greasy goodness, you leave with a smile on your face. You hope your sister has beer in the fridge when you get back to her place.Elmer's is a randomly delicious hole-in-the-wall Mexican food spot that has been in downtown Chandler for roughly one million years. My family started going to Elmer's when we moved to Chandler from Milwaukee, Wisconsin about 20 years ago. I can safely say that it was my first experience of more "authentic" Mexican food, as the stuff we had in the Midwest seemed to have been made by people who had ONLY seen pictures of Mexican food, but had not actually tasted the real thing. (the Mexican restaurant of choice in WI during my childhood was called, unironically and naively, Chi-Chis... no joke) That said, I have great memories of this place! It is tiny, tucked into a small strip immediately opposite Chandler high school. There is a parking lot in the back that can be difficult to navigate when it is crowded. There is a decent patio, however I never end up sitting out there as the tables and benches are made of concrete, which feels like lava during the hotter 7 months of the year. The interior is not particularly special, but also has not changed a bit since I first visited; the furniture looks like it may have been inherited from a McDonalds or other fast food restaurant from the 80s, the floors are linoleum (I think? Maybe tile), and there are fairly cheesy murals of cartoony animals throughout. There is a wrought iron waist-high fence that indicates where to form a line, and a counter where the orders are taken. The menu is done in old-school marquis style, with plastic letters attached to the backing. If you're looking for something in particular, be sure to look at ALL of the menu boards - they have a large menu that stretches all the way behind the long counter, above the kitchen, it is not very well lit, and it is easy to miss something if you only pay attention to the boards that are immediately in front of you and easy to see. I have a few "go to" items - the Strips are oddly yummy... tortilla strips (in lieu of chips) topped with unmelted shredded cheese. Weird, right? They're crazy salty and for some reason, in the hot Chandler weather, the cool cheese with the crunchy chips usually hits the spot. Adding a dab of their hot sauce here and there (also very salty) adds a little heat and flavor when needed. The Cheesy Beef Tortilla is basically the one thing that I order here - not because other stuff isn't good, but because the Cheesy Beef Tortilla is just THAT good. It is a large tortilla (probably about 12" in diameter) filled with Green Machaca Shredded Beef, lots of cheese, tomatoes, and onions, then broiled. It is folded first in half, then in quarters and is usually a "knife and fork" sort of thing. In theory it is like a quesadilla, but in practice it is softer, fuller of delicious stuff, and just tastier overall. They do a good job with their Machaca - very flavorful, good meat (not too fatty, which is a problem I often find with shredded beef in Mexican food) I've also tried tacos, fry bread, burritos, etc - all good, at least standard if not better than most. Pricing is reasonable in my book. On a recent visit we got a Cheesy Beef Tortilla, Two Tacos, Two Drinks, and an order of Strips for around $12. The line/order/wait scenario is a bit of a pain sometimes - I visited on a weekend midafternoon and there were one or two people in front of me in line, which was not bad. However, once you order, you have to wait to hear your number called and pick up your food from the end of the counter. I think we probably waited upwards of 15 minutes for our food to be ready, and it was difficult to entertain the baby while also listening attentively for my number. I think they could definitely improve by creating a table-number setup for dine-in orders so that guests could take a seat, snack on their strips, etc while waiting for their food. The staff are pretty nice - not overwhelmingly friendly but they made things easy and had kind demeanors.I know I can't be the only one that thought of Elmer's glue when first seeing the name of this place.  Anywho, after a couple of visit to Elmer's, I have decided that Elmer's is a decent little joint.  I like it! Elmer's Taco's is a cozy fast food restaurant where you order up front, take a seat, and wait for your order number to be called.  The food they serve up here is Sonoran style.  Get your tamales, green chile mini burritos, bean and cheese burritos, machaca, and other delicious food here!  They also serve cheese and strips which are tortilla chips topped with freshly shredded cheese, not melted.  No matter what you order though, don't forget to get their salsa.  Brett B. had informed me that the horchata served here is powdered and that's why it's pretty gritty to drink.  That sucker leaves me more thirsty after drinking it.Across the street is Chandler High so if you want to beat the rush, come in before 11:30AM or after 1:00PM. The lunchtime rush consists mainly of Chandler High students and boy is it a rush --- the line goes out the door!So yes, come here for some decent eats!  Food is always hot, the staff are friendly and loud, and the tables are kind of small and cramped so you might want to take it home.  It's a hole-n-the-wall shop that delivers some good eats.P.S. No glue is served here.  ;P
Fiesta Burrito=For what this place is, [a cheap, tasty land of burritos (and some other mexican food)] It's gotta get five stars from me. I love it! My roomates eat there like 4 times a week, no joke! It's quality.A little greasy, which is why i don't eat there as much as them. But, if you want good, fast mexican style food. You have to try this place.:::::PROS:::::Clean, clean, clean.  The cooking environment, the floor, the condiment area, the tables - all spotless.Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Most burritos are in the 3-dollar range, and you can't beat the quality for the price.  The chicken burrito incorporated medium spicy shredded chicken done just right, and the breakfast burrito used eggs, ham, cheese, onions, and green peppers to get it done.Breakfast served all-day!  I know other Mexican restaurants do the same, but given the fact Fiesta Burrito is tantalizingly tasty, it just sweetens the deal.Great Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce at the condiment bar!  Need I say more?:::::CONS:::::None.Fiesta Burrito is nice and bright on the inside, and so seemed it's staff.  I believe the crew were truly enjoying themselves the day I went in and the smile on the man's face while washing the floor was refreshingly genuine and sincere.  Its obvious that its a well-run establishment, but its also one of those places that makes me wonder because the food IS so cheap...Seriously.  How can places like J in the Box and McD's sell Chicken Sammies for a buck?  And the three dollar burrito?  I just can't see the profit margin...  But then again, I've never run a restaurant.  I mean - Fiesta's ingredients can't be that cheap, right???Regardless, Fiesta Burrito is great bargain, and the food that I've tried so far knocked my socks clean off.  Check it out.This is my favorite of similar type places by far. We used to Los Betos at the end of nights on the town & in a pinch when we didn't want to cook (as there is one quite near). At some point, the quality had dropped far enough that we hit Fiesta Burrito. My sister had been lauding this place for years.Well, it is not only my favorite drive-thru/semi-fast Mexican food spot, it's one of my favorite value places in town. Cheap great food super quick. It's already kind of a stand by for me & the kids when the Mrs. does a girls night out. Also open quite late which is a major bonus (as both of my other cheap Mexican favorites have limited hours - Carolina's & Rito's).Their food is excellent. Super tasty, reasonable, quick. Nice clean atmosphere, super friendly staff.I typically go with the taco combination as they do the deep fried shredded beef tacos that are so yummy. Their carne asada is also brilliant. Great beans. They have a nice salsa bar as well. The Mrs. likes the green & red chile quite well too.Can't miss with Fiesta Burrito.Never in my many visits to Fiesta Burrito...and there have been a lot of them...have I been disappointed.  Never has the food tasted like it was made a week ago.Never have I had to spit anything out, hoping it had, at least, originated from the cow.Never have I had cause, or been afraid to check the restaurant inspections naughty list.I am a fan.
Salt Cellar=I can't say enough about how great of a happy hour spot this is, other than in my pretentiousness about living central, i will drive the half hour in awful traffic to partake in the coldest St Pauli Girl in the valley and eat amazingly delicious half-priced fresh seafood appetizers. OK, so happy hours should be cheap, and this one is C-H-E-A-P-E-R than if you actually ate at the restaurant portion and not the bar, but if you dive into all of the apps like i do, it will add up very quickly.  Still, the bar itself has so much character and being in the deep Arizona soil makes this place otherworldly on a hot Phoenix afternoon.  Careful, emerging back up to the surface will bite -- what with all that seafood and previously mentioned St Pauli Girl.This place is GREAT, and looking forward to eating a real meal here in their actual dining room.I really love this place, for three reasons:1) That nearly the entire restaurant is underground is really cool. There's something retro about that, though the place itself does feel modern.2) It's romantic, mostly because there are no windows and so it has very low light. It isn't noisy either - everyone there (when I went anyway) seemed to understand that the mood was low key.3) The lobster is actually fresh. They did what they had to do to get fresh lobster to the restaurant the day I showed up to eat it. You do pay for that kind of freshness of course, but please believe me - this is ALWAYS better than eating rubbery, whiffy lobster. If you're going to eat lobster without leaving town, pay the extra for it or stay home.It is a fabulous date restaurant. SO LEAVE YOUR KIDS AT HOME. The darkness and closed in feeling didn't work with the one that was there when I was, which was the one downside - a downside the restaurant had nothing to do with, of course.Otherwise, perfect.Seriously.....F*** this place!  Disgusting food and shitty service, ambience is great if you like to dine in a hot cellar engulfed in stagnated air.  Truly it is over rated, over priced, and they just under deliver.  Forget trying to order a drink here, it will take forever to get and when it finally does arrive you will be ready to pass out from heat exhaustion and lack of oxygen.  How's that for a head change, you don't even have to pay for it!I won't disgust you with the detailed review of everything I have tried here, but to make it simple, it all sucks!  And after you get the bill you will be walking out with a sore ass!  Save your money and spare your self the disappointment.This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.A little outdated, but then again so am I.  After driving by Salt Cellar for 3 years, we finally ventured in or maybe I should say we ventured "under."  It's quite small inside.  Maybe space underground is at a premium?  We had requested a booth after a suggestion in another review, and were accommodated after a short wait in the bar.  Good decision as seating is somewhat tight, but those booths are huge!Seafood is obviously their specialty, but there are beef and chicken options on the menu as well.  We started with Shrimp San Remo as recommended by our server, and it was definitely recommendation worthy.  I could have skipped the shrimp and just had the bowl of sauce and a basket of bread and been completely happy.I ordered scallops, sauteed in butter and sherry with fresh mushrooms.  How can you go wrong there?  Only if the scallops are gritty or overcooked, and they were neither.  Perfect.  My husband ordered another recommended dish, baked stuffed lobster.  A whole lobster stuffed with shrimp and crab.  Tell me that isn't an ingenious idea!But here's one of my favorite things about Salt Cellar.  I like crab, but never order it because it's just too much work to eat it.  Not here.  They do the dirty work for you at the table.  Now that's a reason for me to go back, even if I have to look at gold picture frames!The Salt Cellar in Scottsdale, Arizona has been around for over thirty years but after our first (and last) visit I think its time has run out.The only thing that has changed over the past thirty years are the charges on the wildly over priced  menu.With $35.95 for a 1 1/4 lb. lobster, almost $39 for Atlantic Halibut and $34 for crab cakes, we expected superlative food. Instead we received dishes that ranged from OK to awful. We started with Escargot on mushroom caps in garlic butter and New England clam chowder.  The clam chowder was a thin bland soup with a goodly supply of clams. The Escargot was chewy in a butter sauce with just a hint of garlic.  My Atlantic Halibut was fishy, dry and hard. After confirming my opinion with my table mates I sent it back. Overcooking Escargot and Halibut at a seafood restaurant should be considered fatal errors. My wife and granddaughter had Crab Cakes and Scallops which they judged just OK. Not good enough for almost $80.00 in (2) entrees. To the restaurant's credit, the Halibut was taken off my bill without asking. The restaurant is literally in a cellar. As the air conditioner cycles, the environment alternates between clammy and freezing.  We had a cocktail waitress (I haven't seen one of those in many years) which is code for over-priced soft drinks in a small glass with no refills. The Food Network has a show, Restaurant Impossible, in which the host,  Robert Irvine, visits failing restaurants and fixes their problems. If he visits the Salt Cellar his first stop should be the kitchen.You have to know what you're looking for to find this place.  I've passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.Return Factor - 80%The FRESHEST seafood I've found in Arizona resides in a basement. Well, really an underground restaurant. And being from Baltimore originally, I like to think I know a thing or two about fresh seafood! My wife and I decided to splurge for our anniversary and we mutually agreed that seafood was the way to go! Upon arrival for our resevation we descended the stairs to the "cellar" where we were greeted and shown to our table right away. We were seated in a dimly lit dining room with a few other couples, and despite what other Yelpers have complained about, we did not feel the least bit crowded!On to the food!! We ordered the bucket of steamed clams for an appetizer (looking back I wish I had ordered the escargot as well). They were steamed to perfection with good texture and flavor, and served with drawn butter and a clam wash! For my entree I ordered the Blackened Sea Bass and my wife ordered the Baked Stuffed Lobster at the recommendation on MANY Yelpers! Our meals were amazing! My fish was seared to a light crisp outside, but was still soft and full of flavor inside! Her lobster was stuffed with WHOLE sea scallops and jumbo lump MD blue crab meat! Our waiter Tony even cracked it for her at our table!All in all I'm very impressed with the Salt Cellar... food AND service! Don't believe the bad reviews out there. Bottom line: this is REAL, fresh seafood!I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.Service was excellent, and highly attentive.Food, absolutely horrible.My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies, blah.Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. I've had it with this place.If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristleI worked at the Salt Cellar for over 11 years and I recently started a new restaurant job in Sacramento, CA. Just the other day a table of mine caught wind of the fact that I just moved here from Scottsdale and immediately said, "My favorite restaurant is in Scottsdale, It's called The Salt Cellar!" Needless to say I was extremely proud to inform her that I had spent the last 11 years of my life working at her favorite restaurant. Now with that being said I feel like I need to make a couple comments about a few of the reviews I just read...When you go to dine at The Cellar you need to know that it is more than a restaurant, it is an experience. Most people choose to come for special occasions like birthdays or Anniversaries. By the way, they offer a complimentary dessert for those occasions. Most people can not afford the luxury of dining at a pricey restaurant regularly although there are plenty of regular customers that dine there. In my opinion you get what you pay for and if you want to eat FRESH seafood in the middle of the desert, you are going to pay a pretty penny for it. Go to the coast if you don't like the gas prices it takes to ship fresh fish in on a daily basis. The food there is pure. By that I mean it is not spruced up with glazes and sauces to mask the true flavor of the fish you ordered. Some people may think that is bland. But I think if the chef masked the fish with other flavors, he might as well buy it frozen. My last point about the price is, there is no a la carte. When you order an entree there it comes complete with a salad, bread and two sides. I have seen people leave the place leaning forward because their full bellies wouldn't allow them to stand up straight. There is a review stating that the place is not kid friendly because they don't carry high chairs. Well, personally that is an incentive for me since I don't have kids and would rather not listen to them scream while I'm enjoying my dinner. However, they are very kid friendly. The owner has two beautiful granddaughters who have been dining there since birth. And if you happen to get Cara as a waitress she will probably take your child on a tour of the restaurant to give you a break while you enjoy your meal. It doesn't get much more kid friendly than that!It may seem like my opinion is a little biased, but I have nothing to gain from this review other than spreading the word that this unique little gem of a restaurant needs to be experienced by you. If you are questioning whether or not to dine there based on the past reviews then please take this one into account. It's a unique and unforgettable place. It's privately owned by a couple that care about every guest that walks in the door. If you don't like your dinner, do yourself and the restaurant a favor and say something. Your server will get you a new one or something different. No questions asked. They want you to walk out the door happy as much as you do. One last thing, in my opinion the best item on the menu is the Alaskan King Crab. Not only is it mouthwatering delicious. Your server will crack it table side for you!I WISH I COULD GIVE SALT CELLAR ZERO STARS.If you enjoy being treated as if you are an unworthy piece of crap, you will love Salt Cellar.Short version: We were asked to leave because we were ordering drinks and appetizers, not entrees. We received horrible treatment from top down: owner, manager and server because we weren't spending enough money... and the money we were spending (probably around  $200+ total) wasn't worthy of a table. Now myself, my family, nor the friends I was with will ever spend another dime in this poor-excuse for a "service industry" establishment ever again.Details:Myself along with four other coworkers came here after work on a Friday to order drinks and food. We all arrived separately between 5-5:30 and put our name in for a table because the bar area did not have enough open seating for us. Two rounds of drinks and about 40 minutes later, we are seated. The waitress offered transfer our bar tab to our new waitress at the table, but we wanted to pay the bartender, to ensure he was getting tipped for his time helping us at the bar.Once we were seated, we ordered appetizers, and we continued to order drinks.  About 45 minutes in, the server came over and proceeded to say that if we are not ordering dinner, Salt Cellar needs to use the table for people who actually will be ordering dinner. So, we, paying customers, need to leave our table because we aren't ordering food of a certain price point? Mind you, we weren't just taking up space, we were still ordering food and drink!!!Naturally, our reaction was to question her action. She stood firm. We went to the manager to explain what had just happened. Then, the MANAGER essentially said yeah, if you aren't ordering dinner, we need you to leave the table because there are people waiting to eat dinner. Was extremely rude about it, too. (weird concept, waiting for a table at a restaurant, right?)That alone made us want to leave, and also made us realize that our waitress was probably told to say that, and it probably wasn't her fault. So on our way out, I apologized to our waitress for the way I reacted. The owner overheard me apologizing and asked what was going on, and I proceeded to tell him about our experience. To which he, THE OWNER, responded by telling me that I was wrong. Said we couldn't sit at the table if we weren't ordering dinner. He said that we "misrepresented" our intentions of what we would be ordering (we never said we wanted dinner) Anyway, I told him that it's wrong to treat customers that way, and he argued me. Told me I was wrong and we need to leave. Just FYI: we are not a rowdy crowd, we were not loud, annoying, inappropriately dressed. We are are all professionals who had just come from the office and wanted to go to (what we thought was) a decent place to enjoy each others company outside of work.I've been to the Salt Cellar a few times a very long time ago. This place hasn't changed at all. Small parking lot and a lot of people park on the street. Lots of street parking too. So you walk down two flights of stairs to the bar area and the hostess stand. Very small area with a few cozy dinning areas. Dim lights and romantic setting. All adults and no kids. We started off with the New England Clam Chowder. It's a huge bowl with lots of clams. Really good and the complimentary bread was so good and soft. Very fresh. We also had the Calamari skewer which came with four calamari on a stick with two different dipping sauces. Calamari was cooked perfectly and not too chewy. It was good not not great. So with your dinner you get a salad. I was thinking this was a small dinner salad but no this was a huge salad. A normal salad but with the chowder, calamari, and bread. We ordered way too much. 3 out of the 5 people in our party were full after the salad. It was way too much food before our entree. Anyways, I ordered the Salmon Wellington. The salmon was wrapped around spinach with a nice crusty outside. The salmon was moist and good. It came with a small baked potato and mixed vegetables. Nice meal and lots of food. My wife ordered the Mahi-Mahi with macadamia nuts with a baked potato and grilled vegetables. Like I said before she ate so much she had to take home her entree. Same thing with my son. He ordered the New York Strip with baked potato and grilled vegetables. My daughter had the Turtle soup because she never had this before. Black soup and I stole a bite and it was pretty good. She really liked it. They gave a little shot glass with wine in it where they burned off the liquor and you pour in the soup so it's not too thick. Like I said she loved the soup. She also had the Salmon Oscar with asparagus. She gobbled that down and didn't complain so I guess she really liked it. The service was great. They had multiple people serving you by clearing out the dishes and always filling your water cups. Very nice and friendly. Very helpful. It was a really good with lots of food, good food, great service, and a really romantic ambiance. Just remember to be careful with the appetizer. So much food but well worth it. I enjoyed it. Very different with the underground restaurant. Enjoy.Have you ever been to a place so fancy, that your first thought before you did anything was "Will this make me look like an uncultured swine?"Arriving early for happy hour, before my daughter's birthday dinner, we make our way up to the bar, as the first patrons of the day.  The no-nonsense barkeep, whose entertained both debutantes and scofflaws alike since the Johnson administration, greets us and in a gravely voice, asks "Whaddaya havin"In the lowest, manly toned timbre I can muster, I reply "An iced tea... please".  Looking into his expressionless eyes, I sensed that my drink order may have  just broken his spirit.He returns with my frosty beverage, and a basket of sourdough bread.Sourdough bread... it's the rich man's "funnel cake".A few minutes later, as we were seated next to Arizona's retired elite, who were downing vermouth and olive juice, scoffing at Ketel One, I noticed a plate of olive oil resting on the far side of the bar (see photo), I proceed to dip my bread... and then notice the viscosity is nothing like I've ever noticed before with EVOO.The plate of "coarse salt" to its left should have been a clue.  Nothing quite says "you dont belong", like dipping your sourdough bread in the margarita lime juice.Needing to salvage dignity, I quickly order the shrimp san remo and fish & chips appetizers... and hoped no one was the wiser.  I couldn't try the shellfish dish, but it was probably my daughter's favorite dish of the evening.  My F&C looked like big puffy cod beignets, and were delicious with their light batter.Our waitress then whisked us away to our white linen-ed table, where another full basket of bread was awaiting our arrival.  My daughter commented the feel of the room would go well with Disney's Pirates attraction.  After taking our orders, the waiter brings a tiny chaffing glass of yellowish liquid suspended over a candle flame.  I just assumed this was a heated bouquet of fragrance, being too intimidated to inquireMy daughter ordered her first lobster, and I, my first wellington.  Both of our assessments were exactly the same.  I'm glad I tried it, and I dont feel the need to order it again... everIn time, my curiosity got the best of me, and I inquired as to the canary colored solvent.  It was clarified butter.  Hmm, what exactly can I do with this clear elixir?  It wasn't simply put there for the fragrance.  As the uncultured swine that I am, I proceeded to Google "clarified butter", to better understand these fancy-man ways.Ghee, from the hills of India, which contains some unsubstantiated weight loss properties... so I immediately tossed it back... much like the two ladies with their vermouth and olive juice.A fun time was had by both father and daughter, as we bantered back and forth about our misgivings with the dessert menu, as "funnel cake" was noticeably absentAs we ascended the staircase back up to our awaiting vehicle,  we are instantly transported back from 1800's Spanish galleon to modern day, 104 degree phoenix... while that old, retired lady who was sitting next to you at the bar... you know, the one who had one too many vermouth and olive juices, looks back at you and says "hey, yous can go around me... its gonna take a while""Gladly, madame... gladly"
Thai Basil=Does anyone remember when Mill Avenue used to be a fun place to hang out? Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. One thing I've noticed over time is that their "hot" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.I don't really have much to say about this place.  There's nothing wrong with it, but their dishes don't "pop" for me.  They are not very flavorful (crazy for a thai place, right?) and I often find myself adding Fish Sauce and Chili just to get it to be good.  Lunch prices are fair, food seems fresh and service is great.  My coworkers LOVE this place and I enjoy their company, so I tag along.Best part is they have soy milk for their Thai Tea.  For me, it's the best part of the meal.
Flamingo Pizza=Love this pizza shop!!! Great location, amazing hours (open till super late), tons of choices on the menu. The pizza shop has a new owner as of a month ago and a new menu too! So it's under new management and improved! Street parking infront. Great customer service. Indoor and outdoor seating. Very clean. I tried their pesto chicken pizza, white pizza with basil, bacon cheeseburger and fries and chicken Caesar salad. They have sooo much variety on the menu. They deliver and open till 4am during the weekdays and 530am during the weekend. Which is great for late night eats and an alternative to other asian options in Chinatown . Very close to the strip if you're looking for cheap and yummy eats after partying and they can even deliver to you! I'm a fan! Will be back for more!Flamingo pizza has a pizza my heart! Aloha 9th island.
Guedo's Cantina Grille=OK, so we went back tonight for dinner.. I have to say, I was pretty peeved that they raised their prices.  So, now when I ordered just ONE shrimp taco, it came out to 4.90 with tax and all - are you flippin' kidding me!?!?!  It's about 5 shrimp, chipotle cream salsa, red cabbage, and corn tortilla for FIVE DOLLARS.  No way... I mean, they're pretty damn good tacos for being hundreds of miles away from the shore, but 5 dollars for ONE taco?  That's a bit presumptuous. Like I said before, I'm not expecting .99c value meal prices.. but I'm also not paying Scottsdale prices for a taco.Well, THAT was disappointing.  Seriously. Disappointing.  I guess I should start by saying the food tasted good, but it certainly was not WOW good. And for the prices we paid, it was not good enough.First of all there is no table service. You stand in line to place your order at a counter.  This is something that you expect when ordering / eating fast food, but, again, the prices are ridiculously high for not being a full service restaurant.  OK. So you place your order where you are faced with a somewhat insulting sign that states credit cards are destroying small businesses. As a small business owner myself, accepting credit cards is part of the cost of doing business. Then to use a credit card to pay for your food, you are then charged a RIDICULOUSLY high fee of $1.00 by the cashier.  Look I don't know everything there is to know about credit card processing fees but even when I was selling high-risk services I never paid more than a $0.35 transaction fee + 3%. So for a $6 meal of two tacos, worst case, Guedo's is paying $0.53. But, unless they are really business-stupid, and they are actually paying these high fees for a low-risk business like food service. They are significantly gouging their customers who want to pay with a credit card. Then, to add insult to injury, the credit card slip has a place to add a tip.  A tip? For what? Taking my order, that you're not even going to deliver to my table? So, we place our order and find a seat. The restaurant is dark and while there seems to have at some point been an effort at making the place seem festive, with a Taco Beach kind of theme, now the darkness seems to be intentionally aimed at hiding how run-down the place feels. A large open floor space area near the kitchen in the front of the house has a bunch of stuff stored on the floor out in the open. It just looks like they have completely given up. All of that could have been overlooked, though, if the food had been worth it. I ordered two tacos, which they charge $3 each for. My date's burrito was about $7. Now, these prices would not be too bad if there was some semblance of quantity.  My $3 tacos were the size of street-vendor tacos. Two small tortillas with some meat added.  That's it. Honestly, you can get these for $1 to $1.50 anywhere else and there would be way more meat between the sheets.  It was pitiful looking down at these two little tacos not even half-filled.   My date's $7 dollar burrito was the size of something you get at Del Taco for less than half the price. A plain tortilla wrapped around (again) a minimal amount of meat, beans, sauce, etc.  The flavor of the food was good but not nearly good enough to justify these prices.This was such a disappointing lack of food, that after eating everything we received, we ended up heading next door to the fast-food burger joint to get some food to fill us up.  How sad is that?This place came highly recommended to us, and while I agree the food is tasty, I have no plans to return.  And based on how few customers were there, I suspect others have come to the same conclusion.
Green New American Vegetarian=I decided to try this place out based on good reviews. I was not disappointed.  I have been there twice and would definitely go back.  Green is located on Scottsdale Road and tucked away in a small strip mall.  It's not fancy but the food is terrific.  I had a spicy salad, and my daughter had a parmesan sandwich.  Both were excellent.  I love the green tea.  I will of course return for my third and hopefully more visits. Wish they had a place in Chandler or other locations.  It's the best!Green. I love you. You are my soul mate.Why? Because you have never once in our relationship treated me bad. Never. In fact, I know I do not deserve you.Normally I eat AT Green, but tonight I decided to order take out for the first time. I got the samosas and coconut curry with tofu. I didn't think it was possible to like anything better than the secret bbq chicken sandwich, but I think I found it. The gal said ten minutes, I got there in ten minutes, it was ready waiting for me.. packaged up like a gift from heaven... and by the time I got it home.. it was still warm. And heavenly. Also, there was some very pleasing eye candy sitting outside... maybe I should have eaten there. Silly me.How much do I like Green?  Let me count the ways...1. Garlicky, cheesy artichoke gratine2. I hum for your green hummus (I'd hum even louder if I can order this tahini-free!)3-5. Crab puffs, eggless rolls, and samosas!6-7. Jerk tofu and balsamic picnic salads. Tofu here is fried unless you specify otherwise8-9. Thai peanut and coconut curry bowls10. Thee "argentine" po-boy!11. No harm chicken parm12-13. Tahini coleslaw and those excellent thyme fries!14. Peanut butter and chocolate tsoynami... Tsoy very good!15. Vegan peanut butter chocolate bars16. Proprietor Damon Brasch, who I had a secret crush on (up until he grew a beard!).  Accidentally bumped into him and his wife having dinner somewhere.  Sweet couple.  17. For sale art displays by local artists adorn the walls.  Pretty cool.  The only thing I would complain about is the long wait.  It's been a few months since I last visited, so I don't know if the ordering process is still the same: order at the counter, receive food at the table.  If you spy any of those awesome peanut butter chocolate bars at the counter as you're ordering, make sure you grab one (or three!) as they will most-assuredly run out before you find your way back at the front of the line.  I just shuddered blissfully at the thought of biting into one of these... But I digress.  The wait for the food is worth it, however.  Just be sure to order any of the items I mentioned above, and you'll do fine.  (Do your tastebuds a HUGE favor and avoid the pasta items.  I've tried the orecciete pasta, singapore tofu, and the curry pasta salad.  I detested all of them.)Looks like Brasch added a couple of new items to the menu- ranchero salad and secret bbq chicken sandwich.  I'm going to have to get myself over there very soon to try some bbq!Note: the mock chicken used in the wings is not the same used in all of the other dishes.  A good thing, bec. the wings we ordered were VERY stringy.  This happens when soy is frozen sometimes, I was told.  The Argentine sandwich tastes just like a Philly steak sandwich!  I ordered mine sans vegan cheese ($2 add), but I soon regretted that decision.  I believe Green uses Follow Your Heart vegan cheese (melts very well!), so the addition should complete the deception.  Do yourself a favor and stop at Green for a bite soon.  Oh, and Green runs Friday and Saturday night specials from time to time.  I once had a green sobi noodle entree (wheat sobi noodles with a pesto sauce to die for!).  I haven't chanced upon any specials after that (this was around Valentine's Day '07).  I've given up on their specials, but I'm always assured that they still hold them everytime I ask via phone.  They allow call ahead orders for dining in so that the food is ready to be devoured upon arrival.  Just be sure to time it well so that food is fresh.Hubby has been eating mostly vegetarian lately, so we decided to check out Green. I don't think we'll go back. Everything we ate, we could get better elsewhere. Hubby's pad-thai-ish dish was pretty good, with noodles, a zippy sauce, and big crunchy veggies. All of which makes the nastiness of the egg(less) rolls even more inexplicable. They were positively mushy inside, and had both hot and cold spots. Maybe it's just me, but I like some texture and identifiable ingredients in my egg rolls. They were also weirdly spiced and arrived without the dipping sauce advertised in the menu. The busser admitted they were made ahead of time, which certainly doesn't help matters. He didn't seem to care that we thought they were bad- he just shrugged and said, "Well SOME people don't like them." Well, I guess we're SOME people then. We also tried the much praised pseudo crab puffs, and they were pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce that managed to come out with this plate. Hubby also had to have the soy "blizzard". He liked it, and I thought the taste was fine initially, but then had an aftertaste I didn't care for. The atmosphere is clearly meant for hipster youngsters. The lighting was so low that I literally had a hard time reading the white on black menu. Seriously, Green. Have some consideration for your clientele over 20. The last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff. As we finished our meal, they were starting to close. Hubby went up to the counter to order his soy "blizzard" and the too-cool-for-the-rest-of-us young man behind the counter had to ask a co-worker if they were still making them. Um, if you still have customers in the restaurant, I would imagine you should still be making them. It's not like we were in there for a half hour past closing, and there were still many customers in the place. One last observation: what's up with all the vegetarian and vegan smokers clogging the entrance? God forbid there be any animal products in your bodies, but bring on the tar and chemicals!?! As someone who quit smoking after many years, I would appreciate it if Green would insist that their customers observe the keep-it-20-feet-from-the-entrance ordinance.Vegetarians & Vegans: you're gonna love Green, that's for sure. The place is 100% vegan ingredients & food. And it is delicious!Everyone else: you're gonna like it too! Pretty much everyone that I've taken to Green or talked to that has been there (Vegetarian or not) has enjoyed the food. They've got an awesome selection of appetizers, entree items & deserts. Check em, yo.Green is A-OK with THIS meat-a-tarian.First, let me tell you I'm not a vegetarian. I like bacon way too much and I have a hard time even liking vegetables. I went today for a going away lunch with a co-worker and so surprised at just how good Green was!  I admit, I was totally trash talking the mock-chicken before I had it. It just sounded weird. Pssshaw...."mock" chicken. I'm just super excited about the fact that most of the bowls are gluten free except the Thai peanut. I got the coconut curry "chicken" and boy, was it tasty! They make it with tamari sauce instead of soy sauce, hence the gluten free-ness of the dish.If I wasn't so full from the artichoke dip I would have devoured a soynami (vegan blizzard). They don't have any gluten ingredients in them either, except for whatever toppings you might toss in. It's pretty rare that I can go to a restaurant and eat 80% of the menu. What a treat!Mmmm... I finally made it to Green for lunch today.  I'd been once before but only had a drink - not sure why it took me so long to return.  But now that I've eaten there, I'll gladly return anytime!I really enjoyed my Balsamic Picnic Salad.  (Toasted organic pecans, apples, strawberries and  figs over fresh greens tossed in a homemade balsamic syrup.) Delicious!  I went with the large version and ate it all!I also shared an order of thyme fries although my lunch companion and I agreed that we couldn't taste the thyme...I noticed there were a bunch of fun and unique vegan products for sale including some sweet treats that looked damn good.  Service was friendly and efficient (thanks Stevie).  I'll be back soon!First things first....I love meat! I will never become a vegan or a vegetarian. But I am not going to turn my nose to a restaurant that serves Vegan/Vegetarian options only. I loved the cool ambiance that Green offers. The staff is super friendly and gave me some great options since I explained my lack of vegan knowledge. I ended up ordering the mock fish and chips. Not my smartest decision. I have to remember never to order anything with the work mock in it. It doesn't mock the real thing, I don't care what they say. I did enjoy the fries and their artichoke dip was amazing. I even took home a very tasty cupcake. I would come back and try something a little more reasonable, like a salad or noodles.I already knew I loved @greendamon/Green because they offer a safe haven for vegans (and non-vegans) that realize being vegan or vegetarian does not mean you have to eat healthy, and that every meal doesn't have to be made of vegetables.So, there are some majorly delish dishes... the artichoke gratine, the samosas, orecciette pasta with meatballs, the secret bbq chicken sandwich... and they always have some creative special.Last night we stopped in after the Paso Robles wine tasting at FLEMINGS STEAK HOUSE... hey... we needed to counter all the flesh we saw being devoured.... and right before my eyes was the most magical and delicious creation known to man. Seriously. Like hands down best thing I have ever ever ever eaten. EVER!!So, Green - if you don't put the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich on your full time menu, I think you are denying the good people of Arizona what they deserve: perfection.An amazingly fresh and tasty roll topped with crispy bacon, chicken, mayo, fresh sliced avacado, CRISPY cheese, and jalapenos. Sure, doesn't sound that special...BUT I ORDERED TWO. I wanted to order another. I want one right now. In fact, I cannot imagine a moment in my life where I won't be craving this amazing creation.So - do yourself a favor. Try Green because the food is great, they care about all living beings, they have vegan blizzards, and one day they will have the best thing you have ever eaten on their menu.I'm going to write a letter a day until they add it to their menu. I'm serious. I can be a real pest.Delicious vegan junk food! I am not vegan. I will never be vegan, but I will throw down with the best of them at Green.There are so many delicious treats on their menu I'm not even going to bother naming off the things I've tried here. Just go, eat everything, and when you gain ten pounds don't come crying to me. 'But Kristi, aren't vegan dishes supposed to be healthy?' ummmm NO! If I wanted healthy, I'd poach a chicken breast and eat it with some dry salad and brown rice. Maybe slit my wrists and hop into a nice warm bath for dessert. I come here for fake meat that tastes like angel tears. The only thing they're missing is a liquor license. Located in a strip mall, this place is full of Bieber-esque lesbians and 10 day neck beards just as you would imagine. I don't fit in but when exactly has that ever bothered me? There is even what appears to be a (very tiny) vegan market of sorts inside if you find yourself in desperate need of some Dayia or faux marshmallow fluff. You know, true diet staples. The register area is full of mouth watering vegan desserts that will make you say 'I didn't know you could do THAT with raw cashews!' Man, I love this place...I haven't heard any news lately about the supposed 'new location' but I really hope that is still in the works as it is much closer to home. I can see myself picking up 3 orders of wings to eat in the privacy of my own abode while watching some god awful Lifetime movies on a Sunday. Bring it on Green.  nom nom nomI read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent "manhood" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon..."Asshole".He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy..."vote with your feet"...but I guess that's another review.The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!At the very tippy top of the "near and dear" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.Whit is a Vegan...with a capital "Vege"...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!The big question about Green is "why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?"I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.I like to "fit in".The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!Mmmmmmm Mmmmm Mmm........ so good! I was skeptical about mach meats, but was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were prepared. We ordered a couple of apps & 2 bowls to try. The apps were good, but my drunken mushroom "chicken" was executed beautifully! The best part? The "TSoynami Clunky Monkey" was a dessert that I couldn't stop moaning after every bite! Was that TMI?? Just imagine... Soy Ice Cream mixed with chunks of bananas, pecans, and chocolate drizzled throughout. Even if you eat too much and think you don't have room... don't miss this chance - make room!! You won't be sorry. Overall? Excellent! I am a fan and can't wait to try more on the menu!I was really happy to find another vegetarian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  My wife and I enjoy Loving Hut, but it's always nice to find more variety.We entered Green with high expectations considering the good reviews we saw here on Yelp.  I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.Chili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for "chili fries" here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't "chili" in any capacity that I would recognize.In terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.My wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with "mum's sauce" and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.The egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.The atmosphere was "hip" and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare "WE'RE VEGAN!" means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.  If you want to come here with a friend, share a basket of thyme fries or a dessert, you probably won't be disappointed.  If you want a great meatless meal in the Phoenix area, however, the Supreme Master Ching-Hai has the lock on it.Anyone who asks, "are you a vegan to lose weight?" should come to Green and eat their words. And everything else.In fact, I usually end up at Green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it's "Food you can eat that I actually like." Every dish is addictive, flavorful, saucy, and filling. Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins. Standouts include Tsoynamis  filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge, bananas, kitkats, hazlenut brittle, mint oreos and more.On another note, this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the Tempe/Scottsdale area with a lively, hip atmosphere. Even if you love steak more than anything in the world (and there are steak po'boys, might I add) at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place.Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.I've been anxiously awaiting to try this place for months!I'll start with the good...I'm not a vegan by any stretch and I thought the food was phenomenal! I ordered the Singapore orange bowl with mock chicken and noodles...just wonderful! Seasoned well, fresh veggies, and the mock chicken was a very pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to taste and feel fake, but the taste and texture was just like chicken! My friend ordered the MAC and I swear it tasted exactly like a Big Mac from McDonald's! The thyme fries are delish as well!To top it off I had a cookie dough Tsoynami...OMG...amazing. Like a blizzard that tasted and had the texture similar to mochi. I loved it.So clearly the food is not the issue. I will come back despite the problems I'm about to list because the food is so good!The bad...I was not happy with the service I received. Not warm or friendly at all. I don't appreciate that smug hipster attitude. Sorry. And they don't serve a hot chai latte??? That was annoying. So I settled for tea and they forgot to give me my hot water and then acted annoyed when I asked for it.My tea cup was dirty. It had lipstick on it. Hello, we are in the middle of a flu outbreak right now! Not happy about that. It is expensive. $5 for some ice cream (the tsoynami)? You will not get your money's worth here.Not many options if you can't have soy. It is in practically everything.The food gave me horrible gas (sorry tmi). Not the fault of the place but just be aware if you're not used to vegan food. Maybe it was the mock chicken and/or tsoynami because I eat veggies all the time.I was very impressed with Green.  I only came here because the people I worked with on a recent program had ridiculous food restrictions of the vegan variety.  I try to just cover my ears and not listen to them when they talk, because it's like listening to bubble boy.  Have we rebelled against our very nature?Putting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The "mock" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.  They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.  I would actually come back here, even if other options were present.  That's saying a lot.5 Stars"I couldn't help it. I can resist everything except temptation."   -Oscar WildeAfter consuming a small salad for lunch at home, Linh L. and I made the decision to try out Green's Tsoynamis around 3PM.  Being part of the 80% of Asians that are lactose-intolerant, I've been wanting to try out their decadent "tsoft tserve" soy-based ice cream.  A short car ride later, we sauntered into Green, the Garden of Eden, and were instantly tempted by the forbidden fruit in the form of a delicious aroma.  I was suddenly hungry and something warm was all too tempting."Would you like to see our menu?" asked the hipster-looking cashier.Yes, Eve.  I would like to see the menu.  Also, I swear you were in the art program at ASU with Linh and me...  Weird.Even though I really have been wanting to try Green's Tsoynamis since I first stumbled upon a picture of it on Instagram, I've been creeping on their online menu.  Ever since that celebratory lunch at Thailicious with the adorable Brett B. and Linh L., I've been dreaming of peanut sauce.  Naturally, I got the Thai Peanut with house tofu.  While it has great flavor and the sauce coats the broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and fried tofu well, it sadly didn't have a strong peanut sauce flavor.  I suppose I went into it hoping it will taste like Thailicious' peanut sauce salad dressing but that was my fault.  It was still delicious on the organic brown rice and I was full without feeling heavy and gross.  I love clean eats!  Linh had their special "RocknRolled Tacos" with Seitan chicken.  He liked it.  Although we were both full and satisfied from our impromptu late-lunch, where I dearly wished we had Brett B. with us, we decided to splurge and get dessert.TSOYNAMIS FOR DAYS!  My banana cream pie tsoynami was delicious.  Linh's Dough Boy was also pretty darn good.  It had giant chunks of cookie dough that made my skirt flip [not literally, unlike my time at Fired Pie].  I sat cross-legged in the booth merrily eating my lactose-free dessert while staring at the artwork, the car doors lining the wall, and all the artsy hipster customers and I was happy.  Outside the rain began to fall.  We came, we dined, and we gave in to the temptation that is Green.  Linh even left with a spumoni cupcake.  You guys are good.  You guys are real good."When women go wrong, men go right after them."  -Mae WestI think Mae was talking about Green and me.  My wallet is feeling lighter and all is right with the world.  I'll be back.  XOXO, Joyce W.The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for "ditto" instead of the "diablo red bowl".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her "coconut curry bowl" shared in that sentiment.The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites étaient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused "sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont".I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!Meet up with some friends for dinner, one being a vegan, and Green was the place suggested, and I was looking forward to checking them out.I bet you're thinking a meat eater wouldn't find anything good or filling at a Vegetarian/Vegan place, but I'm here to let you know, you can! And you will walk away full and liking the meal you just had!After checking out the menu, I went with Thai Peanut bowl, right of the bat I knew I loved spicy peanut sauces, so this was up my alley, and it comes with pan fried noodles (you can get rice too if that's your thing) sautéed veggies and I picked mock chicken to go with mine, but since I wasn't sure if I would like the mock chicken, I asked for it on the side.When the dish arrived, it looked like a great stir-fry bowl, it didn't scream vegan at all.  The mock chicken, to me looked like and had the texture of chicken nuggets, but were better tasting, I was kind of disappointed I asked for them on the side, instead of the dish so they could get saucy,  but next time I'll know.  This was a great meal, everything tasted great including the mock chicken.Glad to have tried Green, I also like that Green is Vegan restaurant that offers comfort food. Looking forward to trying out more dishes for sure!
China Joy=This chinese restaraunt was overly priced, had horrible service, overall bad experience. I would recommend going to PF Changs or Pei Wei for the money.
L'academie=First, I think it's important to remember what L'Academie is: this is Scottsdale Culinary Institute's casual, bistro-style restaurant. As such, every encounter with staff is an encounter with a student, from the host stand to the table service to the kitchen. Last night, we spotted the fruit and cheese plate on the dessert table upon our entrance. You see, while the menu is seasonal (maybe to coincide with semesters?), the desserts are changed out more frequently to allow for creativity of the student chefs. The offerings are displayed along with some featured beverages which you are forced to pass as you enter the dining room... a great way to remind you to save room (wink, wink). I guess you could say we had dessert first!Our "starter" featured slices of Manchego, and wedges of blue cheese and a smokey brie bordered by walnuts, pistachios, dried figs, apricots and cranberries and halved red and green grapes. Only real complaint: there were too few pieces of crostini (although we were graciously brought more upon request) and some of the green grapes had browned. Overall, it was a nice way to start the meal.I had the five onion soup. A velvety potage, the soup's aroma was slightly better than its flavor. A bit heavy on the pancetta and worcestershire for my taste.The presentation of the crab cakes  was lovely. Three timbales of crab and peppers surrounded a small bunch of fresh greens bound by a tomato slice. The vinaigrette on the greens was a highlight.L'Academie has a notable wine selection. I was delighted to find Molly Dooker's 2007 The Maitre D Cabernet Sauvignon on the list! Deliciously oaked goodness!Truth be told, it feels like a cross between a classroom and an average American bistro. But, you know what? That's what it is... and, what better way to support young people who love food as much as we do and want to spend their career bringing it to us?!
Pita House=VERY tasty food but not cheap.I went here for lunch with coworkers and since I don't eat flour/wheat I ordered a chicken/kafta plate with rice, salad and garlic sauce.  The service was slow as there was only one waitress and what appeared to be the owner working, but the service was friendly and very accommodating.The chicken and kafta was honestly some of the best I have ever experienced.  Chicken was moist, well marinated/seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The kafta was perfectly seasoned, char grilled, and not greasy like I have experienced elsewhere.  The meat literally fell apart with my fork, so tender and delicious.  Add the garlic sauce... forget about it.  Unreal.  Fresh minced garlic and olive oil, yum!  The rice was also tasty and some of the best I have ever had.My bill for the chicken/kafta plate and Arizona Iced Tea was about $16.50, $19.50 out the door.... not cheap for lunch but I must say it was definitely worth every penny.  I will be returning as budget allows.Seeing Chris R's review for Pita House reminded me to review my experience too.  I stopped in for what I thought would be a quick carry-out order late afternoon / early evening on a Saturday... I skimmed the menu that was posted outside and walked in.  I recall hearing positive things about this place and figured it would be perfect for what I was looking for - a quick and somewhat healthy option to take home and eat quickly as I got ready for my night out.  Was that the case?  Yes and no.I was not sure which side to go in to order from... when I walked in, the one lady working there acknowledged me but didn't return to take my order for a good ten minutes.  Just as I was getting ready to leave, she apologized, but I was getting antsy and annoyed.  I placed my order and told her I'd wait for it... A greek salad and a vegetarian appetizer plate.Neither the salad or the app plate was the best I've had.  They were both fine.  I liked the combo of tabbouleh, hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves, and falafel... and luckily Jared helped me to eat it all as it was a lot of food.  It was more than $20 once I added a bottle of water though.  More expensive than I would've guessed.Will I rush back?  Probably not?  Will I return?  Possibly... not a bad option for Middle Eastern cuisine - and perhaps it's better if you eat in on a night when they have belly dancers or something?!  I'll update if and when I experience that.For all you alliterates out there. I've experienced quite a line of lackluster lunchroom locations as of late, and I'd like to learn what little leprechaun is leaning their bad luck my way.With that out of my system. I've got to say this place has got the market cornered on mediocre. A quick visit to their official website shows a claim of "Voted #1 Mediterranean/Middle Eastern ..." I assure you, they did NOT get my vote.As far as the service was concerned; we were one of two tables seated about 6 - 7pm on a Wednesday, the waitress visited us 1) to take our order, 2) deliver our drinks, 3) drop off / pickup our check. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food. Our waitress didn't seem rude during the few times she did swing by, but also wasn't excited for us to be there.We started with an order of hummus, which turned out to be neither here nor there, then ordered a Gyro Plate and Kafta (Kubideh). The gyro meat seemed pre-packaged and the kafta (grilled ground beef) seemed underspiced and bland. We did; however, order a tasty chicken skewer side, which was good. Nothing about this meal was really fantastic and I definitely not worth coming back. I'm guessing they do most of their business during late night after people have had too much to drink to realize they're eating a sub par meal.Be sure to let me know where your favorite Gyro is, 'cause I'm still looking!
Rawhide At Wild Horse Pass=I haven't been to rawhide in many years. Even at it's newer location it is still is a great play to take out of town visitors. Where the pavement ends and the west begins. The town and people look like they are from an old west movie. Rawhide is like stepping back in time. It allows you to forget all your troubles during your visit.  ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHNot your average tourist trap, no sir. Shee-oot this place was fun. Five stars for a lot of different things, but mostly the fact that these folk are in period dress and character, no matter how many degrees over 100 it is outside. That is dedication right there. This charming old west town has a lot to offer travelers, from fresh margaritas ("25 year old original recipe!!" bellows the guy from the shop window, as he lays into his dinner bell.), to taking your picture on a replica electric chair, to watching wild west shootouts in the street. "We've been here 10 minutes and already someone's been kilt," lamented my host, tour guide, and resident bf of the bff, as we moseyed into the general store. I was looking at shot glasses for myself and my gentleman caller and cat babysitter back home, when one of the "locals" snuck up behind me and startled me by asking if I was planning to steal anything. HA. Hilarious. They never break character. I appreciate how the general store is the first stop, and inside you can also ask questions and buy tickets for the attractions. You can purchase a ticket for each attraction, or a bundle for a bunch of them. As it was roughly one thousand degrees outside (or "normal" as the locals insisted), we opted for the outdoor show and a mechanical bull ride. I lasted about 25 seconds on the mechanical bull, and was offered two more tries, one of which I used. I had never done that before and having the chance to was great! No matter how hard I failed. The live entertainment spectacle was pretty fun. Lots of cheesy humor and gunfights. There was even an opportunity to get flyers autographed by the actors. Cute. I was told I couldn't have one because I was wearing a Giants jersey. I said 1889 World Series Champions FTW and made the guy laugh.It was really too stinkin' hot to do much else, so we made our way over to the Rawhide Steakhouse for some grub. This restaurant is actually really nice and offers some good food along with some....err...novelty items. We ordered fried rattlesnake and Rocky Mountain Oysters, with a side of jalapeno coins and delicious jalapeno cornbread. The "oysters" (read: fried bull testes) were actually kind of good. Chewy, but good. Rattlesnake was reminiscent of calamari. They even gave us little certificates to showcase that we ate these things. For dessert, we got to roast our own smore's!All in all, Rawhide may be cheesy for some or seen as a tourist trap, but they really pull out all the stops here to deliver an enjoyable unique experience. I almost feel like I got a legit time travel trip to the PG rated Old West!
British Open English Pub & Grill=I cannot begin to explain the sheer excitement I feel knowing that I have yet to review BOP. I better take a deep breath.... ...in.... out... in ... out... okay, I'm good. I love this place and it is so unexpected! I went to watch a friends band play next door at Chyro Arts and they invited me to BOP. I agreed thinking I was going to be miserable. But no. Not at all. This place is a freaking gem. Their food is SO FREAKING GOOD. The mac and cheese... omg... they have a bunch of food for veggies, which rules. I see from other reviews that they have pub quizzes and I am going to have to hit that up one of these days. The best part? They are at Scotts/McDowell, conveniently located 2 miles from my house. Oh, and the other best part, no yuppies. ONLY COMPLAINT ... the waitresses are a little slow.I'm writing an update because I came for Trivia Night last night and had a BLAST!!!!!!!!! Every seat in the house was full, but the service was on spot and the vibe was killer.. I also found that that they have quite a few flavored vodkas, including pomegranate, so I was excited to try something new.Again, the Mac and Cheese was SO good... I had two bowls. That's right, TWO bowls. What a pig. I think I will become a Tuesday night regular!The concept of a golf themed English pub in the desert is so foreign to me that I just had to come here. I had a Boddington and the jalapeno cheeseburger (cooked traditionally English style). The burger was nothing special. Wouldn't have it again, but would have the onion rings. Holy crappers Batman, are they huge. I kinda liked the style the place is set up, and even I am not aspiring to become a regular I will come back here when I need a place to have a beer and a conversation.. and possible some ginormous onion rings. The service is nice enough and the place seem clean. When I was here the clientele make up was of the standard regulars, a Led Zepplin listening couple to my right, and a girls-night-out table with 4 girls further in. The atmosphere was nice. Come try this place.
Spinato's Pizza=I have been searching far and wide for a decent pizza/salad place I could get to on my lunch break for, oh, two years now. Fuck decent, this shit is delicious!!Thanks to the lovely Sunny B.'s review on the Spinato's in Central Phoenix, I decided to do a little digging and see if they had one anywhere near Tempe. And that is when I found this total hole-in-the-wall little shack of heaven a block away from Tempe Marketplace.I know we've all been taught not to judge a book my its cover, so seriously, do not let the meager building scare you away as there is a serious gem hidden inside.Chicago style thin crust pizza, oven baked to a perfect crisp. Heavy on the tomato sauce just like I like it, and a heaping house salad served almost immediately after ordering it. And they also have a bunch of gluten-free options for you unlucky Celiac sufferers out there.I am in love. I will certainly be back. After they get their liquor license, I might never leave.It seems that every which way you turn these days there are more and more gluten free pizza options showing up around the valley. Pizza joints around Phoenix have all gotten on the bandwagon since they see how big a demand there is for gluten free pizza in Arizona and how our little community votes heavily with our dollars - even in our current economic climate. Will I pay $15 bucks for a good gluten free pizza? You betcha!Spinato's was recommended to me by my co-worker as the best place for pizza in Phoenix. That was a pretty bold statement to make since there are so many good pizza places in town, and boy, Gary was right. I was blown away by Spinato's.First of all, the pizzeria is tucked away in a business park behind Tempe Marketplace and unless you know someone "in the know" you'd probably never stumble upon it yourself. This place is no frills - block walls, old concrete floors, and simple table setups, but the food is far from simple. It's fresh, cooked to order, and the service was fantastic.They have an entire menu devoted to gluten free item's, so there's no guesswork involved with ingredients or which combo's you can eta, etc..... I had the "Nicole's Favorite" pizza, which is Gluten Free Creations Signature crust, topped generously with slices of Genoa salami, artichoke hearts, onions, and lightly sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. It was perfecto!Now, let's talk about the sauce. I think their pizza sauce may actually be the best pizza sauce I've ever had. It was slightly sweet with loads of fresh tomato flavor, and perfectly seasoned. Each bite was a perfect balance and I had to refrain from eating the whole darn pizza so I didn't look like a total pig to my new co-workers. I politely took half home and then devoured the rest at 4:00 as a late afternoon lunch.  "Nicole's Favorite" is now "Jessica's Favorite! Well done Spinato's!This was the one Spinato's I had yet to visit and now I can finally cross it off my list! Sunday night rolled around and it was a pizza kind of night. When it comes to takeout pizza, Spinato's is at the top of our list but we were faced with the pining question: What location is closest? We decided that this location was the best choice and made our way down to this hidden pizza gem within an industrial setting. This Spinato's doesn't have the frills but it has the food! The delicious sweet sauce, the heavenly sausage and the fluffy bread. I gobble up every bite and I'm sad when it's over! It's best to ask for extra sauce because their sauce is their signature taste. The pizza is also perfect for left-overs so I suggest getting a larger one so you have some for the next day! We got the bruschetta to start and really enjoyed the fluffy bread and flavorful tomatoes and peppercinis. I love this pizza and think everyone in the Valley should try it because they will fall in love too!Meet up with some fellow yelpin friends on Thursday night at Spinato's Pizza.  I didn't even know Spinato's was there and very close to Tempe Marketplace, I just thought this was an industrial area.  This Spinato's has an opened feeling to it, its rustic yet industrial, guess so it can fit in its surroundings.  I also learned this location does not sell beer or wine or whatever booze they happen to have for sale at other locations.  I was running a little behind but I did get to sample the signature pizza, it had baby spinach, fresh roma tomatoes, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese, thick crust. This was a great pizza, simple but delish! The pizza sauce is on the sweeter side, not savory, but I personally happen to like it I also happen to be a fan of thick crust pizza as well, I'm not too crazy about thin crust, so this pizza was perfect in my book!  Service was great and food was good! Look forward to trying it again.We were dropping off my daughter at ASU and was looking for a place close by. We came across Spinato's. Hidden in the business park but found it cause of all the cars. This is a very small place and were seated right next to the window with the light shining in our eyes. They were nice enough to pull the shades down. We ordered the Family Caesar Salad with grilled chicken. Huge bowl and we had plenty for all four of us. Salad was crisp and lots of chicken. It was really good. We ordered the thin crust Chicago Pizza which came with home made sausage and green and red pepper mix. Such a really good pizza. Sausage was really good and the peppers were really good. We gobbled it all up. The service was really good. She was really quick with our drink orders and filled them up in a timely manner. She always asked about our meal and they exchanged our plates when we finished our salad. Always looking out for us. We left and my daughter left her keys on the table and they ran outside to make sure we didn't forget her keys. Very cool. Good pizza, good salad, good service. Do you need anything else? I think not. So enjoy.What a wonderful find this was for me!   Here I had no idea this place was even here.It is tucked away down a side Street near Tempe Market place.I really wanted some good Italian Food. I feel like I can never find good Pizza in the Valley.  This is it! Wonderful, fabulous, just what I wanted Pizza!The crust is delish, the sauce is awesome.  Nice and Hot , on a cold day. I am so looking forward to going back here.We loved our server as well. Great customer service. I do not think you would ever find it. unless you knew it was there. I am so happy I found it.Lots of parking all around the lot.A true simple, and delicious Italian food restaurant. What more could you want??
Spago=Spago is a delightful respite for when you're doing some shopping at the forums, especially when you're not paying. The ambiance is modern and warm, but not necessarily romantic (it's a good spot to go with a best friend/shopping partner/sibling/gay boyf). Dinner was vaguely memorable (halibut and scallops). The service is friendly and impeccable. Not only was our waiter super nice and attentive to my sister and I, he brought out a beautiful complementary chocolate mouse at the end of our dinner with something along the lines of "living it up in Vegas" written in chocolate ganoush on the plate. Hahaha, ok, I don't remember exactly what it said -- we had mimosas with dinner, but it was a very sweet gesture.OMIGOD.. Did I die and go to heaven?This place sure feels like it. From the minute we walked in to the dessert that we shared, we were treated with the utmost courtesy.Food? OH YES. The food was amazing, I couldn't stop saying MMMMMMM... I ordered this- HAND CUT FETTUCCINI PASTA Wild Field Mushrooms, English Peas, Arugula, Glazed Shallots and Parmesan-Reggiano. And let me tell you, since I am a pasta whore. This was the best freakin pasta I have ever tasted!! Tender, tasty, delicately balanced. And oh so pretty. *see pix*BF ordered this- GARGANELLI BOLOGNAISE Braised Beef, Roasted Double Blanched Garlic, Plum Tomatoes, Ricotta Cheese and Italian Parsley. It was good too! Very earthy flavors and good for the meat lovers. We each had a glass of Riesling, which came with a cute lil carafe.. OMG.. so good. And a good buzz too. Sweet, but not overpowering. Very good complement to my fettucine.For dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle. This was good, but the sauce needed to be more warm. It was a bit too thick and hard to pour. *see pix*We sat outside in the cafe area and had a good view of all the people walking by in the forum shops. I love this place! Love love love. Highly recommended!! Now, if I can only find the recipe for that fettucine...It's a tradition for me to visit Spago whenever I am in Vegas. I can't get enough of their hand cut fettucine. However, this last visit was short of extraordinary. But, still the food was yummy.We came for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and were seated outside in the patio. Our waitress came over to get our drink orders within 10 minutes. BF had a Riesling and I got the Prosecco. I was feeling bubbly.The busboy dropped off a basket of bread which had some pretzel style crackers, square onion bread, and some other stuff. The onion bread was my favorite, but unfortunately, they only gave us ONE of those in the entire basket.. WTF.So, we asked the waitress for more of that bread. She came back 5 minutes later with a basket of bread that had everything BUT the onion bread. Stupid.Anyway, whatever, moving on.We got our entrees. I had my usual hand cut fettucine with Wild Oregon Mushrooms, English Peas, Arugula, Glazed Shallots and Parmesan-Reggiano. Delicious as always! Big portion too, took me a while to finish it. BF had the PAPPARDELLE PASTA À LA BOLOGNAISEBraised Beef, Roasted Double Blanched Garlic, Plum Tomatoes, House Made Ricotta Cheese and Italian Parsley. I think he always get this dish too. We must be creatures of habit. He cleaned off his plate in 10 minutes, so yeah, he liked it. Our waitress seemed to be missing most of the meal. We had a hard time flagging her down to get a second round of drinks.. I'm not sure why that was. Spago is usually great with service. But, it's all good! I got buzzed off 2 glasses of Prosecco. I ain't complainin'. Lunch was around $100 before tip. I'll still go back, just hope for more attentive service next time. PIX - http://pandaliciousforme.blogspot.com/2009/12/spago-las-vegas.htmlThe great and a grotesque in this restaurant made it an "eh" experience.First of all, we were bad and decided to sleep all day. This meant that we waited until 11 pm to eat dinner. One would think that this would not be a problem in Las Vegas. I clearly remember a wilder youth when this was not a problem. However, that wilder youth had much lower standards and we looked far too nice to settle for the cheap crap at O' Shea's. After several closed doors and unsympathetic hosts throughout Ceasar's, we found this place still open in the mall. They had a limited menu, but we didn't care.Our adorable, brunette waitress whose name I sadly forgot was stellar. Super friendly and attentive. Ten stars. No question.The food was ok. My non-Italian father could make better pasta. And I didn't like his pasta when I was growing up. However, the pizza was pretty good. Not incredible. But pretty good. Even the New Yorker tolerated it.The drinks were terrible. Both my manhattan and his martini were undrinkable. The bathrooms were a disaster. Absolute disaster. They looked more like the bathrooms after the 7th inning of an A's game rather than those of a nice restaurant in Vegas. I know it was midnight when I went, but come on. I should not have only one choice of stalls to go into because the others were dirty, strewn with paper products, unflushed, or had menstral blood dripping across them. Have some pride and clean your %$#@ing bathrooms. And while on the topic, seriously ladies?!?!?!?!? How drunk and tore up are you that you can't flush a toilet or wipe up your own period? Cleaning bathrooms is gross enough without your careless antics. Nasty skanks!So, get the pizza, order drinks they cannot screw up, and use the casino restroom instead.
My Big Fat Greek Restaurant=Almost every single time we go, we have a great experience at My Big Fat Greek restaurant. Our latest trip (this past Saturday), was no exception.Food was awesome, service was good and the overall experience was great.Vegetarian recommendations: Greek Fries, Pizza Salad (so damn good), Vegetarian Moussaka, lemon potatoes & lemon rice.Meh, this place is just, alright. I came here with a bunch of co-workers for lunch last week, and wasn't very impressed. I got the hummus which was pretty good and the lunch special which consisted of a beef gyro and Greek salad.. it was decent, but I wasn't floored with the quality of food. The price was perfect though, a good deal for the amount of food they pile on the plate. I will give them a star for the sheer fact that the cups they serve their drinks in are enormous. I dont think anyone needed a refill. The passion fruit tea is tasty, the waitresses are really friendly and the atmosphere isn't completely terrible, its just the food that was the Debby downer, kind of like this snore-fest of a review.My traveling companion had me psyched for some steak the moment we landed in Phoenix... I was super set to chow down and then he remembers some greek restaurant that he once went to here that blew him away.... and this is how I ended up here one Thursday evening.I checked the Yelp app and after sharing that it was a solid three stars I was told "those Yelpers don't know greek food..." Ah, ok, let's see.Well, Phoenix Yelpers you did not let me down. M.B.F.G.R. is a solid three stars. The hummus was ok (I've had better home made over the last few years), the chicken and beef skewers were tasty but there wasn't a secret sauce that blew me away and the veggies they serve with them were standard - cut carrots, broccoli and zucchini. Or maybe I don't know greek food.They make the only baklava I've ever liked! It was softer and not as heavy as the ones I've tasted elsewhere. The honey tasted like fresh natural honey instead of candy. Me likee ;) They also have baklava cheesecake, which is their own creation and not offered anywhere else. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but it was yummy!I washed both of these desserts down with a glass of white wine. I forgot which one it was, all I remember is it was our servers favorite. Next time maybe I'll try a main entree, lol. :)The service was good. They accommodated a large group of us. Our server was professional & friendly. Parking in this area can be a bear, but there happens to be a big parking garage directly East of this location! Very convenient.I feel like a big fatty rolling out of here after I eat my weight in food. It's just that good! I'm a fan of all things Mediterranean and I've always been pleasantly surprised at how delicious MBFGR's food is. I particular like their hummus and gyros and I also really love their Greek french fries. Who doesn't enjoy a good flaming cheese!? I was especially surprised to realize how good their baklava was because I'm never a fan of baklava. However, they do something delicious to it and it made me a fan. This is definitely a good stop along the Mill Ave circuit and especially during happy hour when their pricing is practically a steal.First time I have ever been to this location here in Tempe. The hardest thing was finding a place to park! Other than that it was great. We got the appetizer with all the tastes of Greece. Grape leaves were wonderful, as well as the Hummus. Lots of bread was served with everything. Pita Bread and a type of bread in small slices, which was very good and fresh.So wonderful and delish was the Flaming Cheese! That was amazing!I got the lamb and awesome... I would get it again.We did get the Baklava cake, not my favorite. Real Baklava is much better.  Service was very fast and friendly. Restrooms were clean. I would go back here any time.
Mamacita's Restaurant=If this place were crack cocaine*, I'd snort it.  In short, magical happiness in the form of a Mexican/Cuban restaurant in downtown Vegas.  Believe it.  *Also, crack is whack. See:  http://extremecatholic.blogspot.com/images/whitney.jpgOnce in a while, miracles happen to me. It's often while I'm traveling, which is probably because (a) you're in a more desperate, survivalist state when you don't have your bearings and therefore unexpected discoveries seem more miraculous, and (b) when I travel I visit almost exclusively the historic downtown core of any place, which is usually where everything magical resides. Now, I may be the only person in the world who travels to Las Vegas to visit the historic downtown core, but this is who I am and you're just going to have to learn to deal with it. Also, fuck the Strip. It's the same shitty middleamerican crowd, it's just more expensive and larger scale, which are shitty middleamerican things anyway.Back to the historic downtown core thing, they appear to be doing some civic redevelopment stuff in the "East Fremont Street" area. So when LB and I were traipsing around in the 105 degree heat admiring historic neon signs and abandoned wedding chapels, and we noticed a big sign across from the El Cortez for "MEX/CUBAN FOOD", I knew immediately that a travel miracle was upon us. And it was. First of all, it is the cutest fucking place you have ever seen. From the neon signage to the bright pink and gold chairs and pleather booths to the waitresses' dresses, it makes you want to kill yourself for ever having eaten at a crappy Chevy's. It's the real deal. It also has a giant big screen TV upon which we witnessed the following: latin music videos on "htv" (hispanic tv? anyway, h-urbano was our favorite channel), music videos featuring booty shaking ladies and armadillos, and - this is for real - a DVD concert series of recent performances by KC & the Sunshine Band, Wild Cherry, and the Trammps. Now, if you know me, you know that disco music is the way to my heart. So Mamacita's, you had me at Play That Funky Music Whiteboy. But I'm not sure you had the large Mexican family eating at pushed-together tables, because they were not stoked when you turned off the Urbano. Also, I should add that the sound system is first rate, and I think at night it turns into a dance club. Sweet.So, we also learned, "Mex/Cuban" does not mean a mishmosh of two cuisines. Apparently the owner (?) is Mexican, and her husband is Cuban, which means they have two distinct menus, one for each cuisine. Which results in more delicious choices for you, the customer. I would recommend ordering everything under "side orders" and a Cuban Sandwich. That's what I did. You may want to play it more on the healthy side and order the vegetarian fajitas, or the avocado salad. I know this because I ate those, too. Also, make sure to get the yuca. It comes two ways: fried, and in an oily roasted garlic sauce. I mean, you might as well get both of those, too. I'm not going to lie and say we didn't.  You can also get an entire roasted tilapia, if that's your thing. We actually didn't order that. Anyway, the point is that the food in Vegas is so generally shitty that when you're ready for a meal that doesn't involve processed lunch meat or $0.99 shrimp cocktail, Mamacita's is there for you, so be ready to EAT.Also, the ladies serving you are pretty much the nicest people I've ever met, so if you are one of those assholes that is rude to cab drivers and waitstaff, please don't go in here because I will be forced to break knees.The customer base is eclectic. A nice mix of latin families, oddly misplaced white people and the local street characters, of which there seem to be many on this part of East Fremont. On the walk back to the hotel I was asked if my ethnic heritage includes Russian by a dude smoking a doob in plain sight, and I'm pretty sure I saw Aileen Wuornos order a burrito. But something about it was way less scary than the nasty hooker trash at the Palms.Everyone has been raving about this place, and we couldn't wait to try it. Located off off the strip on Fremont Street across the street from the El Cortez Hotel, (We parked there!) we were surprised to find it relatively empty at 9pm. (It was a FREEZING night!) For this one, I'm going to go with listing the Pluses and Minuses: (+)+ Easy Parking, across the street at the El Cortez+ Roomy, good for groups+ Cheeeep eats! Huge portions! (-) - What was the *DEAL* with them BLASTING the Eagles DVD and then after that the BRITNEY DVD on HIGH VOLUME at 9:30PM on a Monday night? I was running low on energy at that point in the evening and the volume was reaaaaaaly too high for me, cranky ol' lady. I hear they usually play salsa music, which is would have much preferred (not hatin' on the Eagles, actually.) - It was Freeeeezing in there- we sat near the window, perhaps that was why? Bring a sweater if you're coming here for dinner in winter-time. - The meals arrived ~20 minutes after we sat down, which is fine, but the plates were SUPER COLD to the touch... for those of you who know how much I love my food PIPING DANGEROUSLY HOT, this was a minus for me. Overall: a solid 3.75 stars, as the food was tasty tasty and it's a great deal on some Quality food. Service was friendly, and they let us sit around a few minutes after they closed, as we were just engaged in catching up.While staying at the El Cortez Hotel for the 2009 NASCAR races, my buddy mentioned that there was a little Mexican-Cuban restaurant directly across the street that he wanted to try out. I am so thankful that he suggested Mamacita's!I ordered the #5 combo, a Chile Relleno so delicious that I couldn't stop raving about the flavor in between each bite. Also included was a fried carnitas taco that was fatty & flavorful - a great combination at $10.95. What also set this place apart was the large LCD TV playing a video of Elvis Presley bringing down the house. Great DVD, great sound! On my second visit alone, I ordered the same dinner, plus two ice cold Coronas, while watching a DVD of the greats from the disco era.Probably the only reason that I would stay at the El Cortez Hotel again is that the hotel is so perfectly situated to this little restaurant - check it out!My friend Karen had seen this restaurant and had made mental note that she wanted to give it a shot. We decided this is where we would do dinner last night, before hitting up the Western for $1 shots and beers and then to Dino's for Karaoke. Wow where do I start? Waited about 15 minutes until we were finally approached for a drink order, let alone questions regarding the menu. I had never had Cuban food at a restaurant so I was a bit clueless on what certain things were. I asked the waitress what the house specialty is or what is ordered the most and or popular, she then points out a few things on the menu and says this is OK, um that is OK. Well you know what lady, I am looking for more than just "OK". Crappy service for starters, after finally coming to take our order it took another 15 minutes or so to get our drinks. The food took forever, and only two of four meals were brought. So I am sitting waiting until my friends food comes so I can eat. I said screw it, my fajitas are getting cold waiting so I dug in! After the non helpful suggestions from the waitress, I decided to play it safe and ordered the beef and chicken fajitas which came with a side plate of rice and beans. The fajitas were a large portion of dry unseasoned chicken and beef. Not much flavor at all to speak of. I have had better fajitas at El Torito's. Disappointment for me as even the rice and beans were bland, very bland! Friend #1 ordered a bowl of menudo, she said the flavor was not the best and she is an old school menudo eater. She asked the waitress prior if it their menudo had a red or white base, the waitress pulled the menu and pointed to the picture and said that is what it looks like. Also her plate was a sloppy mess when it arrived, menudo juice all over the plate and running down the side of the bowl, the presentation was just bad. I know they were rushing to get orders out but there is just no excuse for that slop to be dropped at anyone's table. I attached a picture, check it out.Friend #2 got the Tequila pollo dish with a side order of chile releno. The chicken was one big slab on the plate, would have made a better eater friendly and a visually appealing meal had they sliced it. The portion was generous but did not matter as the taste once again was bland as the other dishes we tried. Friend #3 got some sort of beef dish that was nothing but grizzle, all she was able to eat was the white rice and the black beans she spit up. Literally had a plate of wasted meat left. She probably should have sent it back as was basically inedible. The service was slow, and not very friendly, did not seem like a good outcome if a complaint was issued, I think that is the vibe we felt. Still I would have issued my complaint as they can not improve something if they are not aware or getting the complaint. Service and food very disappointing. The tab was $80.00 for four of us for bad service and plain, unflavored food. We will NOT be back. Also the flat screen TV blasting the Michael Jackson videos, over and over and over and over and over was overkill. We could not hear each other so we had very little conversation between the four of us. A hilarious moment, the waitress walked past our table and because the music video was soooooo freakin loud the waitress did not even hear my friend calling her! We just wanted to ask if they could turn it down. Several other patrons were talking about it as well. Ok they were not talking about it as I could not hear anyone, I mean I was lip reading along with watching people point to their ears so I am assuming they were thinking the same as we were that the music was way too loud. Don't get me wrong...music is my life but when I dine I am not really down for a taped concert at the same time. It was ridiculous how loud it was.This place sucks balls...and not the good kind! This place just gave reason for a bitch fest that night from my friends, and they are not even Yelpers! I never want to endure that again!They should also train their employees on cuban food, not cool for a specialty restaurant to have staff that is clueless in regards to the menu.Service sucks Poor food Pricey
The Grapevine=2.25 Stars rounded down.  Like when your pencil needs sharpened and it's not much more than a nubbin.  Rounded down.  #2 pencil.  Food was serviceable no more.  Nickel and dimeing going on too.There was some heavy duty karaoke action going on in the bar.  Does the word "wail" mean anything to you?  If it does do it with pride.Atmosphere with inside/outside seating is OK.  Plenty of misters as well as plenty of Mrs.The grapevine, bitch.  Invariably, if I'm bombed in scottsdale or anywhere close, an overwhelming urge hits me to get over to the 'vine and hit up some karaoke, blasted into a microphone with an angry face but a heart full of love.Being the married chap that I am, I won't often be there, but if you see someone singing I'll Be There For You or Piano Man, know that it isn't all it could be unless Richard Z. is singing it, and throwing in his customary dash of Love (the secret ingredient).They have food? Sure, whatever.  By the time I get to the 'vine I am too sloshed to care about food and way too sloshed to stop drinking.  And any post-grapevine morning where I can wake up and remember all the songs that I sang is a failure in my book.I would now like to write another review for the grapevine, and this applies only to the grapevine when I'm singing George Michael's I Want Your Sex. One billion stars.The Grape Vine is one of the best venues in AZ to catch a Nathan S. show and believe me everyone should experience a Nathan S. show at some point in their lives. He is as talented and energetic a performer as the world has ever seen.I don't know what else goes on in this establishment but I do know that the karaoke here is tits or bitchin or whatever Scottsdale language is these days for neat-o. The song selection is fantastic, the crowd is awesome and most importantly they have a stage! I am a little bit of a performance god (see ham) and love a good karaoke stage. Watch me people, envy me, let me get you off! I am a golden God!!!Ahem...The patio is awesome and large. The drinks could stand to be cheaper for this type of bar but I guess when you drop it in the neighborhood that it is dropped in you have to do as the Romans (See vomitorium).P.S. I am hungover and haven't a goddamned clue what most of this review means.I came here with a group of Eliters after Thursdays OYE.. what better way to get to know a new group of people than through Karaoke? You find out whose shy, whose got shitty taste in music, whose heart is broken, whose the attention whore, and whose that fucking guy in the corner anyway? We were all previously sauced up, so why stop now? You have to be saucy for Karaoke. Drinks all around. We were also all full.. so no one ate anything, so I have no idea what the food is like, but apparently its good shit.All I can say is that there was a rockin' selection of tunes to choose from, an eclectic mix of people, adequate seating, full bar, and BONGOS. Fyes. I can assure you I made an ass out of myself, multiple times, but hey.. I had a damn good time doing it. Totally recommend this spot for you to do the same.I have two opinions of this place-it got a LOT better as the night went on. Not sure if it was the drinks...wine seems to make everything better doesn't it? We got there really early, like 8:00, to get a table for our large group for the evening, and the place was packed with Karaoke "regulars". When I say regulars, I mean these are the folks that probably would try out for American Idol if they weren't about 30 years too old for the show. Seriously amazing voices and talent, but taking it a little TOO seriously. You know the types. I actually felt a little uncomfortable and out of place until I FINALLY got to since my first song. Our waitress was a total bitch and tried to short change my friend $10. We hadn't had THAT many drinks that we wouldn't have noticed $10 missing on a $3.00 beer. Fast forward to about 10:30 or 11. Many drinks have been had at this point and the regulars have thinned out. Crowd is pumped, singing along, dancing on stage and having a great time! The place is packed with people who just want to sing along, dance, and get a little crazy - not try to score a record deal! My type of crowd for sure. Moral of the story: If you are a super serious Karaoke starlet that feels you missed out on your record deal, go early, like 5pm and then please leave promply at 10. If you want to go and shake your ass, sing along to every song out there, and have a grand old time, hit it up after 10. Just don't expect to get a seat.I don't really feel compelled to write to much about this place... only for the fact that i didn't have a terribly horrible time... but i didn't have the time of my life either.... i met up with some fellow yelpers which was the high light of the night of course :-)   ... but i was my own DD so no drinking for me... only lemon Water :) mmmm..... so good.... the bathrooms were very clean... but the toilets were so low i was practically sitting on the floor... and the stall door was so close it was about an inch from my knees... uncomfortable.... the last chick at the very end of the night had the mic last.... and she couldn't even keep up with the rap song SHE CHOSE.... so she apparently felt the need to start cursing at everyone else to sing it too... are you serious?? it completely lowered her from a lady to a tramp in 2 seconds... i was done... i would go again.... but i would definitely relocate by midnight....I LOVE karaoke & I would NOT be offended if you called me a "karaoke whore." I sing in the shower, I sing at the grocery store, I WAIL in the car, I LOVE to sing! So when my Yelp-mates decided to visit the Grapevine, I was allllllll inPlease know that the Grapevine is a dive and people here sing a ton of country music. They've got a guy who runs the karaoke and sits in a small booth in the corner of the main bar. You'll be able up select from two books, one by artist & one by song title. The song selection was decent but certainly not the best I've ever seen. The crowd is on average in their 40s-50s but if you're younger it's waaay more fun if you go there with your friends. The sound in the bar is a bit off balance but the Grapevine offers a fun time!!31 Yelps Challenge: #3/31This place is such a dive that it's awesome. I was in town with some coworkers for a summit and whenever we get together someone always mentions karaoke. Looking on the Yelp app for nearby bars or places to find such an activity, The Grapevine was at the top of our list.Sure, it's not a well lit, clean or fancy bar in any way. And service is a bit slow, yet friendly. But the atmosphere, the clientele and the karaoke host  were absolutely bad ass. The crowd was a mix of people above 50 and people around 25-30. So every other song was unfamiliar to half of the bar and every other song was either terrible (in a good way) or totally awesome. I had an absolute blast. While dive bars and karaoke are not typically my style, if I find myself back in Scottsdale for another work function, I certainly won't turn down a chance to come back to The Grapevine. A-OK in my book!Part of me wants to give The Grapevine 5 stars because I thought it was awesome. Just consider this...- At several points throughout the night our group was the only group of people in the place other than the KJ and bartenders. When this happened the KJ picked songs for us and made us sing them. Songs like I Like Big Butts or Short Dick Man- The KJ joined several songs in accompaniment on the harmonica.- It's a dive bar with karaoke!- At one point the bartender was making me a drink and singing a karaoke song herself.But, the truth is a 5 star rating might not be entirely fair. Because it is dirty and dim (as a dive bar should be). And personally I think they'd rather have their regulars in here than too many new, hipster-y folks indulging in the irony of singing a Salt-n-Pepa song while the older KJ plays along on his harmonica. And also, the place puts a hurting on your pocket book considering what kind of dive it is. I haven't seen prices this high in a karaoke joint since I last lived in SF. Ouch.I hate to leave a bad review because we went there tonight because I love karaoke  and that part was fantastic. however, this place really needs new bartenders. I think she said her name was mia, it was loud and hard to hear, but she was awful from the minute we got there. I arrived with a group of 7 people who  all ordered drinks. She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fiancé is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had. Mia needs to find a new career because service  and friendliness are not her forte.I have never experienced racism to this degree. Came here with my friends (of which we are all multicultural). It took nearly 2 hours to have a chance to sing. Even after tipping Gimli (the "Dj" who chooses who sings next) he still would push off our songs and give priority to all the other white patrons. We sang along with the American music we know, and cheered for the people we don't know. We were discriminated, and did not have the opportunity to sing our karaoke songs after 2+ hours of waiting. The same patrons (who seemed like locals and usuals at the bar) were given multiple opportunities to sing. Once we realized that they were pushing our opportunity to participate, we were approached by the owner who asked why we were leaving. We told him we felt discriminated, and he responded back by telling us "well, most people tip the DJ" even though we had tipped the DJ 15+ dollars. Out of the 3 people that tipped, only 1 person sang after 2 hours. I have not felt or experienced this type of discrimination / racism at any of the other bars or restaurants in Scottsdale. But walking into this location, I knew we were in the wrong place on the wrong night.Don't even think about karaeoking in Scottsdale unless you're white.
Hangar Cafe=A Hangar Cafe Haiku:Butter Colored GreaseMagical, Viscous PondOn Plate, In BodyThe Japanese really had something going with these haiku.  If it isn't worth saying in 17 syllables, is it really worth saying at all?  True, this is contrary to every facet of my conversational style, but...I look for only two things in a breakfast place.  Eggs and hash browns.  If there are eggs and hash browns at a restaurant, it is a-ok.  But if you go to Hangar and sit at the bar, you will see them slathering a paintbrush into a golden vat and then smearing what comes out onto english muffins, into recipes, on to the griddle, and so on.  And that warms my heart in a way that would make every nutritionist cringe.  The bacon is cooked to that sublime level of disintegration where it just melts in your mouth.  Pancakes--decent.  French toast?  Actually quite palatable.But the chicken fried steak? Now we're talking!  A dish that comes with all four of the food groups (i.e. butter, fat, grease, lard) making a succulent primordial soup on your plate.  Bursting with flavorful morsels of sausage and beef.  The perfect hangover cure, and by that I mean that if you're hungover, go stuff yourself with this meal and you'll want to die, but at least not because of the alcohol you drank.  Everyone wins, kinda.Note: at 11, they no longer serve breakfast and who wants lunch after what I just explained to you?  Although I did have a croissant club sandwich and it was very respectable!  Just not, you know, chicken fried steak.There sometimes is a wait.  Deal.  Because if you're looking for a greasy spoon, you just found it.Diner category 4 star joint.  Tucked off the beaten path unless your path happens to be a flight plan.  This place is busy on weekend mornings.I've been a couple times for breakfast.  Good basics:  eggs, omelets, toast, potatoes, etc.  They are capable of cooking to order which is better than many places these days.  If you ask for your eggs scrambled lightly that is what you get.  The atmosphere is diner meets aviation.  To get to the entrance you have to enter the hangar area close to the runways.  Fun!
Villa Pizza=I have been eating at this Villa Pizza for over 14 years. (They recently relocated). The owners have always been nice people and even though the pizza is a little over priced I enjoy it. When you pay $40 for a large cheese pizza and 15 fingers, you expect them to be good. I've never had an issue until today. I ordered delivery from this Villa (Cheese Pizza and fingers/hot.) It took almost 50 minutes to get here. which was fine...but when it got here the pizza was barely warm and the fingers looked like they had barely drizzled hot sauce on them. Usually they come doused in the sauce and they are hot and fresh. I was really upset considering I also tipped $6 to the driver. Since I've been a patron of theirs for years I decided to call and let them know my dissatisfaction. The owner's wife answered the phone. I explained to her the situation in a calm manner. She said that they took the pizza right out of the oven and delivered it. Which could possibly be true. I am sure they delivered several orders on the way to mine. She also stated that their chicken soaks up the sauce. I've ordered this exact meal several times and never had it in that condition. When I explained it to her, she got flustered and handed the phone to her husband. He then proceeded to yell at me and tell me that I was wrong. I was extremely offended and told him that I have ordered from them for 14 years. He said he would send me a fixed order. I told him it was not necessary but that I just wanted him to acknowledge that it was poor. He said he was sending a fixed order and that I didn't need to order from him ever again. I was completely offended. I could not believe that after eating there and ordering food to go for over 14 years that I would be treated so poorly. I can honestly say I will never order from them again as I refuse to support any business, small or large that would yell at customers like that. I am afraid to eat what they brought to "replace" the order as I fear it could be "compromised." I am so disappointed, to say the least that any business would treat customers that way. I will NEVER eat or order from this Villa Pizza again.
Malee's Thai Bistro=I'm a bit picky about Thai.  Maybe that's why I'm so hard on Malee's. It's not traditional Thai. Which is not necessarily bad if you don't know the difference or just don't care.  The food here is decent.  The atmosphere is nicer than most Thai places. However, for the price, the quality of the food is a bit lacking and inconsistent. For example, I'll use my favorite Malee's dish--the seafood curry. I've ordered it 5 times and 3 x's it was great, 2x's the seafood was very over cooked and dry. At Malee's prices, that's not kosher.However, one thing I have to give them credit for is service--it's excellent.  The manager is very professional, courteous and does an awesome job taking care of any mistake from the kitchen.if you want Thai in an atmosphere that's more upscale than traditional Thai restaurants, try Malee's. if you don't care and/or are a cheapskate like me, and/or desire more traditional Thai, try Thai Basil in Tempe.I was so pleasantly surprised by the experience I had last night at Malee's. I was expecting your typical Scottsdale crowd, prices and wait staff, but what I found was exactly opposite. When me and the lovely CP entered, we were warmly welcomed by the hostess. This shocked me since most times hostesses are snotty as can be. We were seated in a large, comfortable booth and immediately greeted by our waitress, Angel. Angel was also extremely friendly, accommodating, had a really good knowledge of their offerings and provided really great service. I was extremely impressed with the prices. We got two meals, two beers and a glass of wine for under $40. I really enjoyed the dishes, and they were plated well. We got the yellow curry with tofu (+ tofu at no extra charge is awesome!!) and the Hippy noodles with tofu. Both were extremely flavorful and perfectly spiced. The ambiance was great, the food was great, the service was great and the prices were great. I have no complaints and I will be back for sure!COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!After my disappointing experience with Malee's at Desert Ridge several years ago I pretty much wrote the chain off.That is, until I was with a few friends on a Sunday evening looking for a bite to eat after visiting the DBG for the Chihuly exhibit.  The four of us decided on Thai & our friend that was driving mentioned Malee's.  We all agreed to give it a try after we realized that the other mentioned options were closed on Sunday evening.To start, Malee's atmosphere was not bad.  The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.  The service was marginal...  Our server proceeded to explain all of the specials, all of which he pretty much said were not good.  Pretty strange, but I always appreciate the honesty, but needless to say, we ordered off of their regular menu.The food...  The food was OK, nothing special.  I absolutely LOVE great Thai food, however, this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant.  Presentation was great, but the food was missing the real Thai flavors & covered with tons of sodium-rich sauce & oil.For those of you who rave about this place, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama for excellent authentic Thai cuisine.Back to the COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!After the four of us had our first serving of food with rice, I went in for another serving of rice from the community bowl to try my partners dish.  Amongst the rice was a "friend" looking up at me, a COCKROACH.  Although I am vegetarian, the fact that an animal was in the rice did not freak me out.  Cockroaches, however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant.  I already had my concerns after visiting the restroom to wash my hands before dinner, what a freaking mess!  But that's another show...After finding the cockroach in the rice, I brought this to the server's attention, trying not to make a scene & upset my friends who had all already eaten from the rice bowl.  I requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem.  He saw it & agreed to bring a new bowl, which he did shortly thereafter.  One big problem that I have with Malee's is that we did not receive any sort of apology for being served a COCKROACH in our rice.  I was not looking for a free dinner, but an apology was in order for such a disgusting situation from both the server & a manager/owner would have been nice.  Obviously the server & or management did not care that they served us a COCKROACH in our food.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about sanitation.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about their customers health & well-being as long as they get their money.Needless to say, I will never go back here again.  If you are looking for a good, authentic, sanitary Thai feast, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama.Malee's Thai Bistro is a Thai restaurant in Scottsdale.  Good not great in this Yelper's opinion, but you'll find some quality dishes in a contemporary atmosphere.My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - Malee's Thai Bistro has two dining areas.  You'll find a main room and another that accompanies the bar.  On our weekday visit, it was busy, full of energy, and had a nice vibe.  We sat in the room with the bar and it had a nice mural of Southeast Asia on the wall.  1 Star.Service - Our server was very friendly and helpful.  We did have a problem with one of our dishes (see below) and while she wasn't available during the meal for us to address it, she did have it removed from the bill.  Kudos for that but I would have liked a check in so we could have addressed it earlier.   1/2 Star.Food - Crispy Basil Chicken - order it.  It's the best item.  You'll get tender, well-seasoned chicken that you can pair with rice or any other noodle dish.  It's slightly sweet with a hint of basil.  We also enjoyed the calamari salad, although it really didn't seem like a Thai dish.  I guess it felt like it was a more American dish vs. Thai, but I was good.  Our Pad Thai was ok - nothing great but nothing bad.  Our one item that was really off was the Pad Woon Sen.  I love this dish - as it has thin glass mung bean noodles, scallions, and egg (main ingredients).  Our dish, however, had a hint of kerosene smell.  As we ate it, something didn't seem right.  We tried to flag down our server but she didn't come back until we were finishing up.  Now, they did remove it from the bill, but it would have been nice to of had the option to replace it instead. 1 Star.Will I Return? - Maybe.  Aside from the Pad Woon Sen, our meal was good.  Now, I think the menu has a lot of American influences, but there seems to be enough to warrant a return.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.(Lyrics - Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up)We're no strangers to ThaiYou know your food and so do IA full reviews what I'm thinking ofYou wouldn't get this from any other guyI just wanna tell you how it's tastingGotta go to a Thai BistroMalee's gonna serve you upMalee's gonna sit you downMalee's gonna serve a round and dine youMalee's gonna make you riceMalee's gonna fry noodlesMalee's gonna ask your spice and burn you!I don't recall how many times I've reviewed Malee's but it always turns out for the better for both of us.  Malee's has been a highlight of for Thai food in Oldtown for quite some times as I recalled when I first moved here; and you know what....it still is!Tonight was a special night as some of my friends and I gather for a birthday party and feast.  We ordered a bottle of wine and went for it.  I ordered their Crispy Pla (A.K.A Fish Candy).  They have other dishes that I love like the Crispy Basil Chicken; bite sized chicken glazed with a tamarind chili sauce, and Drunken Dragon Noodles; rice noodles and chicken tossed with basil and bean sprouts and lightly green curry sauce.  Everyone around the table wasn't sure about my order because of the name, but as dishes were being passed around my dish was becoming the star of the night.  Crispy fried fish drizzled with sweet and spicy pickled jalapeno garlic sauce on a bed of cabbage.  The sauce really was the star since I'm sure you could put in on chicken, beef, or pork and it would still be a great dish.I love Malee's for their traditional take on Thai food, but also the ability to fuse an American style to enhance it's food.  Overall, Malee's is a must go if you're ever in Oldtown Scottsdale!
Pong Pong=Pong Pongs has been here forever. The food is cheap chinese food but usually has really good flavor. They have all the standard dishes.  The only bad thing is they use "parts r parts" chicken. I usually end up having a discard pile. (thx Ryan C) but can deal with it. Just do not go expecting great high end dining. They DO deliver!
Café Lalibela=My first Ethiopian experience in AZ.  Jared's first Ethiopian experience ever!  Friday night - no food in the house - I throw around ideas of places to go, Jared nixes them... this is how the evening started.  But somehow I convinced him to get in the car and head towards Tempe.  I knew there were some Ethiopian joints, and I somehow convinced him to try Lalibela!  We both really enjoyed it!Mona was our waitress... and she suggested we share the #16 (Meat Combination) and #17 (Vegetable Combination) to give us a variety of dishes.  That would've been plenty, but I also wanted to try the #10 (Shiro Wat / Ground Peas), so we had that too... oh and since Jared was starving, he ordered a Shorba (Lentil Soup) to start.  The soup was just ok, but the food was delicious!  We loved the injera (Ethiopian Bread).  and used it to eat the variety of dishes served on a big platter.  Our favorites were the Gomen (collard greens), Fosolia (string beans and carrots), and Key Sega Wat (spicy beef stew), but literally everything was good... we were stuffed after almost cleaning the platter!I have some friends that have more adventurous palates (ahem, Colleen C), so I look forward to sharing more Ethiopian meals with them at Lalibela in the future!And one last thing:  for anyone questioning Ethiopian eating etiquette, it says on the front of the menu that "traditional Ethiopian etiquette disapproves of licking fingers while eating (even though it may be tempting to do so).  I hope that anyone that shares future meals with me at Cafe Lalibela will adhere to this too.It was date night and his pick, and Café Lalibela was the place he picked. I have never been and was excited to try it out. It's a quite cute little place, we were there on a Friday night around 6pm, and it wasn't too busy. Service was great and friendly. After checking out the menu and asking a few questions I went with a 3 item combo, I picked the alicha sega wat, doro wat, and shiro wat. I'm not scared of the spicy and I love flavors! The alicha sega wat is a beff stew, tender chunks of beef that has been simmered in a spiced butter, onion, turmeric and other spices. Doro wat is a spicy chicken stew, chicken simmered in spiced butter, red pepper, onion and other spices and the shiro wat is ground peas cooked with berbere, onion, garlic and ginger, and I can tell you everything was just delicious! It comes with forks, but I don't really think your supposed to use them, its served with injera, which is like   a thin dense crepe/tortilla that is a sourdough bread and you just use that for your fork . I have to say the bread is amazing, loved the sourdough.The food has amazing flavors and smells, the taste was equal to what you smell, it just wasn't very eye pleasing, but get over that quickly because its some amazing stuff! It was a great date night, great food can't wait to go back.For May's International Supper Club UYE we went to Café Lalibela, after makiing reservations for a large group, we noticed when it came time to eating we were a smaller group than planned, but without any issues we were able to move to a smaller table to free up the larger one if needed.I won't lie, I have been here before and was looking forward to coming back, I already knew what I wanted too. I ordered the #18, it's a spicy combination of doro wat, kye sega wat and misr wat with selate and injera. The plate presentation really isn't pretty, blobs on dish, but the food is great tasting! So get over the plating presentation.  Doro Wat is a spicy chicken stew, it was simmered in kibae (spiced butter), berbere (red pepper) and onion flavored with various spices. The Kye Sega Wat is a spicy beef stew simmered in in berbere (red pepper) and onion and it too flavored with various spices. The Misir Wat, which is one of my favorites, is split red lentils cooked with onion, berbere, and herbs, if you love lentils with a little bit of spice then you would love this too! Selate is a side salad and it was great tasting as well. The Injera is a sponge like crepe that is sourdough, made with teff & wheat flour, its texture is different but its taste is great, its like eating the inside of a sourdough loaf.Service was great and the food was delish! Look forward to coming back!
Village Tavern=I admit it...I like potato chips:)Back when there was about 60 pounds more of me to love, you could say I really liked potato chips:)But still, if you are looking at the classic "nutrition pyramid"...potato chips are stuffed in there at the tippy top, along with perfectly grilled bone-in rib eye's, single malt scotch whiskey and Dungeness crab legs...all good things and good for you, too:)At the Village Tavern, they have an appetizer called Colorado Potato Chips...freshly fried potato chips...with a bunch of junk on them.But, if you ask them nicely, they will bring you just a plate of the chips, all fresh and warm and salty, right out of the fryer...without all the rest of the toppings:)Now that's an accompaniment:)A grace note, if you will:)The Beautiful Carin and I stopped by the other evening... we hadn't been there in several months, and Sarah G's review reminded me that I have missed the good old Village Tavern.They pour a nice drink at the VT and have a " 1/2 price on any and every drink" Happy Hour, so we had a couple of inexpensive KetelOne marti's and decided to have an early dinner:)I had the Maple Cured Pork Chop and Carin had their Teriyaki Chicken...both were very good!At VT, they also make a decent prime rib, some very serviceable burgers, a crab cake sandwich that really uses real crab and tastes like a crab cake should (no, it won't transport you to Newport News, but it's good:), and a Chinese Chicken Salad that always seems to draw me in:)I've had all of these menu items before (and several other items as well) and never had a bad meal:)In other words...good, solid tavern/road house fare...except for the chips:)They transcend the genre and make VT a place worth returning to from time to time (not too often...got to watch the cholesterol:)The atmosphere is pleasant and the service has always been very pleasant and friendly:)I never feel that the staff is trying to "optimize" me or turn the table quickly.And finally, in a rare "double", I need to give a five star shout out to the Village Clubs...by showing my membership card for the Village Clubs at VT, I get a 15% discount on the entire bill:)I know...it's a chain and I do like to buy local, but come on...Village Tavern has those potato chips...Fresh, Warm, Perfect Potato Chips!Potato Chips...Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in:)Donald S. just reminded me I had not reviewed the Village Tavern yet.Eat at your own risk, I can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like. I la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until. Dun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud! We packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do.I've been here several times to grab a bite to eat and have a couple of Beers.  It's a great spot, the food is excellent!  Here's what I've had:Turkey Ruben w/Sweet Potato Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=PR3-qXFxVcULwd8qwpzZGQMustard Pepper Cheeseburger w/Cole Slawhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=9_5qO97PMWBTdRvUeZkyhgHopnot IPAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=5c6ql3lxSYm1xmkARu-CPgThe Turkey Ruben is amazing!  Full of flavor and with just the right amount of Sauerkraut....yum!  The Sweet Potato Fries are good too....I could eat a whole plate of those!The Mustard Pepper Cheeseburger was another interesting dish.....the Mustard gave the Burger a nice kick when combined with the Pepper.....the Cheese evened it out and the sweet, creamy flavor/texture of the Cole Slaw also complimented the dish.Kudos to the Chef!The bartender was really nice too.  He made sure I was good to go every visit.  I enjoyed watching the NBA playoffs here.Return Factor - 100%There is such a thing as "Grilled Meatloaf". And everyone should experience this wonder.It's not my mother's meatloaf. (Shh! Sorry Mom. This is better. I'm really very sorry.)Tucked on a corner of the The Shops at Gainey Village is a quaint little restaurant, complete with an outdoor patio. Alas, the patio and I were not properly introduced as the super comfortable looking loungers and tables were already scooped up. Instead, my friends and I were greeted like friends at the bar and found three (count 'em, three) stools right in a row waiting for us.I don't know if the patio is always this super busy, as this was the 1st Thursday of the month. There's music 1st Thursdays (until March of 2014) in the center area of the shopping area with different live bands.  I do know that reservations are not taken for the patio area. It's first come, first serve! So hurry kids, hurry! Those seats look mahhvelous.Given how delish the food was I can understand why. Hoh Boy.Our group took the hearty advice of Rick, a super bomb diggity bartender, and went with the "hot crab dip". The serving size is large and plenty for a group of three. If I were to attempt this at home I'd perhaps throw in a hint more spice. (Maybe a touch of celery.) But really, this gal was sassy pants happy scooping away at the dip. The provided copious amounts of toast to enjoy the dip which was rather nice.My friends shared a Cobb Salad. I had to laugh at them. The serving size was gigantic. HUGE. I turned away the opportunity to sample what looked like a wonderful salad. I was being single minded in my determination to eat AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE of my meat loaf. (My friends said the Cobb was very much to their liking. They eat out quite a bit, so I take their word for it.)Grilling meatloaf put a new spin on it for me. Ok, fine. The menu does say "Family Specialty". I was majorly bummed this morning when I remembered my left-overs where not, in fact, in my apartment. They were sacrificed in the name of car pooling.Yes, that happened. My heavenly grilled meat loaf was sent off to a better life. And I did not get to enjoy left-overs today.I will go back to the Village Tavern and eat this again.Thank you Rick the Bartender for a *great* recommendation! (Also, you were a wonderful server!)Oh! And the house red is a new friend of mine. (Five bucks!) Can't go wrong here.UPDATE! UPDATE!I sat on the patio! No wonder this spot is hard to come by. Very large area with super fine seating. Comfy. So comfy no one wants to get up :) This time my visit was during a Sunday brunch slot. Boy! No joke. 11:30 is a popular time. We were super lucky and scored the last table. On a Saturday, I doubt this would ever happen. (I heard men dragging their families inside with, "NO. We have to sit inside so I can watch "the" game." Yay for me! I mean, us. There was a group of us :)this place is good. kinda like your Houlihan's type restaurant. you know, like that restaurant in Office Space, but without the wait staff flair'd up. I had a blackened tuna sandwich which was pretty good with sweet potato fries. the sweet potato fries taste like they're lightly dusted with a cinnamon sugar maybe, can't be mad at that. it kind of enabled me to skip dessert. my doctor thanks you. sort of.
Bandera=Are you looking for the ultimate cornbread?  Order the cornbread skillet (last time I ate it was $4 for a 5" or 6") and you'll search no more!  I began my ventures here on the recommendation of a coworker after I mentioned eating complimentary cornbread from Z'Tejas and the $2 basket at Redfish Grill and Bar.  I first started having one huge slice (you can substitute a slice for a side that comes with their entrees).  I then graduated to just ordering the skillet and having two slices.  On my next visit I had half of the pan (the server even commented how the meal I was having that night wasn't very nutritious).  I seriously believe that my corn allergy was aggravated with my obsession of Bandera's cornbread skillet :(I was able to try two entrees on separate occasions before I went stir-crazy on the cornbread.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, so do try some.  The salmon is also very good.  For sides, the spinach and glazed carrots are nice.  The enchilada my aunt tried was also quite tasty!  To help keep your wallet padded, have lunches here instead of dinner.  The vibe here is usually subdued, with great-looking staff and clientele occupying space, but it can get quite noisy on busy nights.  In the summer, try to sit at a booth with the window cracked open.  So refreshing, and quite relaxing- almost like having dinner at one of your chalets.Houston's, but with a less extensive menu...that's what people say about this place.And they are right...to an extent...so that probably explains why I actually like the place:)The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening (as you can see, I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like stories:)We have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale, Bandera is:* Close* Pretty Decent Food* Close* Pretty Good Martinis* CloseWe generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the door:)I do enjoy the corn bread...like corny, bready candy:)And the martini's are big and chock full of vitamin V (and priced somewhat less than the marti's at AZ88:)The food has always been good, the short ribs, the rotisserie chicken, the prime rib...you know, just good, solid, all-american fare:)Bandera is probably nothing you'd go out of your way for, and certainly nothing that I would queue up for a 90 minute wait for (during the winter months), but worth the stroll over this time of year:)So, if you're in Old Town and looking for corn bread, braised short ribs and an ice cold vodka marti, stop in and see the folks at Houstera...I mean Bandston's...oh, you know what I mean:After reading some glowing reviews of Bandera (specifically of their 'best on the planet' cornbread) here on Yelp, Krashawnda just had to try the place. We went on a Friday night and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes, though they actually were able to get us in a bit quicker. The hostess was extremely helpful and polite and accommodated us really well; even though we missed our name being called while we were out walking... upon returning she was overly apologetic and concerned with getting us the next available table even though it wasn't her fault... kudos for that. The ambience in the place is superb. As some others have mentioned it is a little dark, but we enjoyed that and found it to be rather relaxing and romantic. If you happen to be on a date this would be a great place to snuggle up in a booth together to enjoy the night. The darker lighting and decor creates a classy feel without feeling too pretentious like some other Scottsdale locales... although like any nice Scottsdale restaurant it's going to be hard to completely avoid the 'tool factor'... you're still likely to see a few spray tanned  Scottsdalians with their collars popped getting fueled for a night of mindless club hopping. Now for the best thing about this place... the food! The menu is pretty basic, no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes. We started out with a couple of appetizers; the deviled eggs and the much talked about cornbread. First off the deviled eggs were very tasty... I'm not sure what they used in them, but they had this slightly chunky consistency and the taste was different than the usual homemade deviled eggs I'm used to... kind of like deviled eggs on steroids; very good and cheap (About three bucks for four of them, perfect just to try). Next on the docket was the much ballyhooed cornbread. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread... but I have to admit; the other Yelpers are right on the money here; it's the best cornbread I've ever had. Each bite was like little fireworks of buttery crunchy goodness going off in my mouth. They cook the cornbread in this perfect way so that it's crunchy on the outside yet soft and moist on the inside. It really is heavenly... and this is coming from someone who usually passes on cornbread. For our main dish we split the rotisserie chicken sandwich and a half rack of pork ribs. Both were amazing... the ribs fell right of the bone and were served on a bed of super thin crunchy French fries. The chicken in the sandwich was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The sandwich also came with a small salad which was sprinkled with some kind of nuts and tasted very fresh. The portions were perfect... not too much but certainly enough to fill you up. We saved just enough room to try their 'Homemade Oreo Cookie Sandwiches'... and I'm really glad we did, I squealed with delight each bite I took... it was amazing. They were basically two medium sized crispy chocolate cookies stuffed with homemade Oreo ice cream... served on a bed of hot fudge. It was everything I imagined it would be and more; definitely one of those deserts that doesn't disappoint you when they bring it out. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a while. To add to everything, the service was also very prompt and courteous. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which is always nice) and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well, the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face, then complaining about you when they're not by your table... but that's really nitpicking, in fact I don't know why I even mentioned it. One nice quirk was when they brought us our bill the 'customer copy' of the receipt was neatly folded over the credit card like a little piece of origami... cool little things like that make a big difference when looking back at your dining experience. From start to finish I'd have to say the place really blew us away... it's definitely the total package and it's somewhere I look forward to eating at again. I can't imagine anyone going here and giving the place anything less than four stars. As it stands right now it's a solid 5/5 from us. If you're in the mood for some solid grub in the medium price range this place is a sure shotI went to Bandera when I first moved to AZ a few times and enjoyed it... and then a few years passed and I didn't really think about it.  But then all of a sudden, Bandera was on my mind.  I needed to go back!  Perhaps I was craving that cornbread or that warm atmosphere that I remembered, but for the past few weeks, I've been suggesting Bandera to whomever I'm eating with so I could return.I saw Bandera at Noche De Gourmet, and that just put it in my head even more.  So finally, this past Sunday night, I convinced my dining companions to go to Bandera!It was around 7:30pm... it was me, Jared, my parents, and Joan M (my mother-in-law).  We'd all worked up an appetite watching my brother complete in IronmanAZ.  We arrived at Bandera and luckily, there was no wait.I ordered the cornbread and grilled artichoke as appetizers for the table.  A few of us enjoyed a bottle of wine.  Our server was really sweet although perhaps a bit annoyed when my dad attempted to special order the sides that came with his fish.  My mom had the meatloaf, I had the Macho Salad, J had the rotisserie chicken, and Joan had a Caesar Salad and side of brussel sprouts.While I really enjoyed the appetizers and wine, my meal was not all that... On the menu, the Macho Salad is described "with Roasted Chicken, Avocado, Chopped Almonds and Goat Cheese." I ordered it without the almonds but it had some other surprises in there as well including cornbread croutons and dates.  Don't get me wrong - i like those things but I also like to know ahead of time what I'm getting!  The salad was huge and could've easily fed two of us.  Everyone else seemed satisfied with their meals.I know a lot of people compare Bandera to Houston's (and they are both under the Hillstone Restaurant Group umbrella), but I have to say, I think the food at Houston's is much better!  I will no longer be craving Bandera's food... but perhaps I'll return for just their cornbread!on this particular night, we originally had dinner rezzies over at The Estate House just down the street... but i was so strongly turned off by their hostess/wait staff hanging around up front when we walked in the front door there, that i convinced my group to leave.(and i've NEVER done that before in my life, which tells you how unacceptable it was)since i'm fairly new in town, someone else in our group suggested we go to Bandera instead. everyone else unanimously agreed and then proceeded to rave on about how much i would like it. we walked in, and were greeted by a professional and warm staff. it was so refreshing, in comparison to the place we had just left. since we didn't have reservations at Bandera, and it was a saturday night, we had a short wait. no problem, cocktails up at the bar anyone? there seemed to a tiny bit of a scene going on up at the bar... or, uh, rather what scottsdale *attempts* as a scene i guess. haha i mean, who doesn't enjoy looking at pretty people? even if they're trying way too hard to mimic what they think LA people are doing. *sigh* but i digress, back to the cocktails. made just the way i like them. the bartender was also great at handling the large crowd hovering around her while keeping glasses filled until our table was called.now this is where my love for Bandera started to drop. the menu wasn't exactly exciting.... however, if you're in the mood for a southwest/tex mex style cuisine, this place is definitely for you.(it's just not my thing) everyone at our table insisted i would *love* the cornbread appetizer served in a hot skillet, so we ordered that. it was tasty for sure, but not mind blowing or anything... for dinner the only thing that even remotely appealed to me on their menu was the filet (when in doubt, go with the steak i always say) which came with a side of grilled mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes. um, the steak was fine, but the veggies and mashers were just ok. not bad, but nothing special.happily, the service was consistently great throughout the entire night. they kept our drinks filled, and never made us feel rushed or that they were irritated with our requests.no one ordered dessert, but we all stayed around a little to chat over one last cocktail before finally closing out our tab.we left in great moods.would i go out of my way to come back? probably not, but i can see the appeal of this place to others. not all of us love southwest/tex mex food, but for those who do, you'll truly enjoy the experience here.Think of Bandera like Houston's with a Southwestern flair. Well, I mean it's owned by the owners of Houston's after all, so it's not a surprise it reminds me of Houston's. I enjoy Bandera for dinner because it's cozy inside and filled with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant without making it uncomfortable for customers. I like this atmosphere because we can have a nice dinner for two and be in our own element but it's not quiet either. Nothing's worse than being in a dead silent restaurant where the staff is lurking around waiting to hear your conversation. Now moving on to the food side of the evening. I have two words: southwestern cornbread. Oh my...I could eat the entire skillet, but I contained myself and just had a corner of it. It's filled with jalapeno, and chunky corn throughout the bread. It's amazing. It's so amazing, it didn't even need butter. That's a sign of good bread. I had the crispy chicken sandwich which was delicious but ginormous. In summary, I have Bandera on my rotation for great dinner spots when it's time to make it a night out but without making it a huge deal.My father's friend recommended Bandera as a dining location during our family's pilgrimage to Scottsdale. It's a popular restaurant - when we called up at 5:00pm to make a same-day reservation, the earliest available table was at 9:15pm. We decided to wait for a table instead, and were seated in about 45 minutes.A quick perusal of the menu told me that it was a Hillstone-owned restaurant: there's the "macho salad", a butternut and cheddar enchilada, homemade Oreo sandwich, etc. This was a bit disappointing as I've dined at a couple of Hillstones elsewhere and was hoping for a more original dining experience. But since we were there, we ordered:Grilled Artichoke (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#NXGmm9uLQ9DrIYJSSJffMw): 4/5 Who doesn't love a nicely-grilled vegetable? This was nice and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside, and served with a good remoulade dip. They serve this at every Houston's and is an appetizer I'll always order.Skillet Cornbread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#sd27YFMBnR2nFa0P4FY2og): 2.5/5 Another Houston's staple. There is much less cornmeal in this than in most versions of cornbread, and it's quite heavy on the butter. This combination makes for a heavy, non-cakey cornbread, which I actually prefer but will leave traditionalists a bit disappointed. You'll find corn kernels and jalapenos baked into it.Crispy Chicken Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#p25rQpHnyaxrdxQu8feqXQ): 1.5/5 I had this at Honor Bar in Beverly Hills and LOVED it. Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing. The chicken breast was flavorless in addition to being fried too long so that the overly-crispy batter was falling off. There wasn't enough moisture in the sandwich overall to combat a heavy-tasting bread; the kale slaw was really lacking in vinaigrette and there was none of the delicious honey aioli I remembered from the previous time I ordered this dish. It didn't get finished.Bandera-Style Roasted Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#Cc7HeytW61mGJIjsOjzuSQ): 2.5/5 I guess there's only so much you can do with rotisserie chicken, but this wasn't a huge step up from what you can get at El Pollo Loco for far cheaper. While the 1/2 chicken was moister, it was prepared with the same paprika and onion powder rub. The accompanying rice looked fantastic, but was ultimately very bland and herbed with parsley rather than cilantro.Banana Cream Pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ) 1/5 The only thing "banana"-y about this dessert were the fat slices on the plate. The pie itself had none. The custard wasn't flavored with anything (no vanilla, no banana, no nothing!) but was just your standard thickened egg yolk. And the whipped cream had no sugar or other sweetener mixed into it and was completely bland. This was less than half-eaten between 3 adults.We were a bit disappointed with our dinner and won't return in future visits to Scottsdale. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who has been to another Hillstone/Houston's in the past.Somebody please lower the flag to half-mast out of respect for Bandera's dead menu. I was wondering why they kept it dark in the restaurant. It was so dark, I could see the ghosts of past meals wandering around. 'Eeeeat meee.'I dined there expecting dinner, but felt like I got only small plates. I'll admit less is more sometimes, and with my finickiness and snobbishness for quality over quantity, I'd like to think this was a good deal. Have I been took, because I'm feeling jooked - hook, line, and sinker?Seasonal Vegetable Platter ($15) was pretty with bright primary and secondary colors of reds, yellow, greens, purple. It served a bit of cucumber salad (very tasty), cherry tomato halves, a slice of red bell pepper and a yellow slice too, broccoli, and disappointing bread that was soggy with something oily. Skillet Cornbread ($8) is about 6" diameter. It's good but crumbly and too sweet. I wanted a strong corn flavor with spiciness from the jalapenos, but I tasted no corn and no pepper whatsoever. Dip Duo ($8) with thick tortilla chips was delicious and I could not stop eating the chips. My impulse was to order more, but the ramification of eating too much of a good thing...ugh, I decided to pass this time around. First dip was avocado. Very good (no tomatoes - yeh!) and not salty. The second dip was of cheese and very salty - chunky too - like cottage cheese which was kinda weird. If you order it, do yourself a flavor and slap some of that salty stuff on the sweet cornbread. Winner! Salad ($10) was good with fresh greens.Enchilada ($7) of potato, squash, and shard was topped half-and-half in two sauces tasted okay.Other items on the menu include entrees and specialties ranging from $15 to $40 and desserts for $8.
Papa Razzini=I like that they lead with warm slices of ciabatta and a dish of bruschetta.  The bread is brushed with a touch of garlic.We ordered and shared several dishes:  chicken parmesan which came with spaghetti noodles and a nice marinara.  Cheese ravioli, a nice mild filling of ricotta and spices.  Angel Hair which was ordered with a vodka cream sauce that was also very nice.  And chicken and sausage cacatorri, my favorite.  Lots of chicken medallions, sweet and spicy Italian sausage, red and green peppers, onions and stewed tomato's with a flavorful and robust blend of spices.The portions were generous, particularly for the kids meals.  Prices were a little higher than average but the food was well above average.The service was great.  Papa Razzini's is not very big so the setting is a little more intimate than many valley restaurants.  I like a cozy Italian restaurant so that works for me.  The have some nice outdoor seating as well.I know, boring review.  Sometimes I just tell it like it is.Papa Razzini's is a great little family owned neighborhood Italian restaurant.They start you out with some warm bread and a bowl of tasty bruschetta. This is one of the best "free" appetizers that you could get at any restaurant. Love it!Their salads are pretty good, but the dressings are a bit thick. Due to this, we opted to go for an oil & vinegar dressing topping instead.For the main course, I can emphatically recommend the Bird's nest dish. I absolutely love it. Angel hair pasta with garlic, basil and olive oil goodness. I don't know what they do, but they make it sooo delicious.We love stopping in at this spot when we're out on the East side of town.
Einstein Bros Bagels=It is really sad to give this place a one star.  I was really excited to have an einstein near my house and I have been to two other locations of einstein bagels and this is the ONLY location that is completely horrible.  The people here a are completely rude and unprofessional. When I ordered the person that was taking my order just asked, "What do you want?....That's it?...Go over there."  He seemed so unhappy and hated life.  Now, I go on to the second register to pay.  I believe he was the manager of this einstein location and surprisingly he looked unhappy, too.  Sighs, I went to pay and I am sure he heard me say. "Wow, the people that work here are so rude."  I took a bite of my chocolate chip bagel with regular smear & it was overfilled with  cream cheese and my bagel is burnt. Sighs, shaking my head. I hope one day, I can update my review and give it a better rating.  As for now, one star is what they will get.
Carl's Jr=Yes, Abu J.. I will elaborate. Just for you.$6 burger Fail .. you probably cost 35¢ to make and you were cold.Soggy french fries Fail .. How do you F up fries? Srsly.Sprite lacking Co2 Fail .. It is NOT hard to reattach a new tank.Customer Service Fail  .. I don't appreciate being scowled at while handing over money.And honestly, I never liked this place.. its crap IMO.
Cindy's Arizona Cafe=I really dig a good ole Mom and Pop greasy spoon diner.Unfortunately, with the corporate skullduggery muscling out the competition and brainwashing America to embrace the familiar mediocrity of preformed, seasoned sawdust, they're few and far between. I mean, if I want a microwaved meal the same 50 states over, I'd go to Applechilidennybee's. If I want some down home, from scratch, mama couldn't have made it better cookin', I'll go to Cindy's. Being a small business, the decor is a little hokey. They're not spending money on some razzledazzle, flash and awe marketing flare. (They have ads embedded into the varnish of their table tops, people! They're selling dining space for revenue! Just so they can keep their entrees cheap as sin!) We sat in a room that was a shrine to John Wayne, big enough to accomodate our 8 person group. There were no less than ten pictures of The Duke. (That includes four duplicates of that wacky picture where the scale of his hat is off and it cuts into his head about an inch.) And to top it all off, there was a mirror running the length of the other side of the room, ensuring that double The Duke stared down at us as we ate. Weird.But what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the tuna melt to be a sandwich of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp bread, smothered in cheddar cheese and pan fried to perfection. And the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.Everyone at the table ordered something different (from the hot roast beef dinner to the fried fish, Caesar salad to the pork fritter sandwich) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!So go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!
Red Lobster=For a ghost town of a shopping center, this Red Lobster is busy.  It's always busy, especially during lunch.  Once you get past the mini-wait, everything starts to fall in place.  Service at this Red Lobster has always been great.  There have been times I've come here on a limited lunch break and told our server. To my surprise, they did what they can to get me and my group in & out.  On my most recent visit, I was craving a steak and also lobster. Then I found what I thought was perfect.  It was their Lobster Steak meal.  But if you've been here before, you know what this is. It's steak with lobster bits on top. I expected a lobster and a steak.  My bad, I should have read the menu better.  Also, the price was fair.  As for their other food choices (from previous review):-Bottomless Shrimp:  I don't know if this is daily or all the time.  But I have had it in the past.  Their fried shrimp has more batter than shrimp, but still pretty good. -Seaside Shrimp Trio:  Is a favorite when in the mood for shrimp.  It's shrimp pasta, fried shrimp, and garlic shrimp-Tilapia and Cod  I put these all together, but their cod is really good.  Big thick pieces of flaky fish.  Tilapia is prepared pretty good to.  Both are not fishy.  -Steaks:  Mixed reviews here.  I've had steaks here prepared either too dry or too greasy. The steaks are not as good as a Ruth Chris' but definitely better than a Chili's or Denny's. -Lobster:  My opinion, one of my favorites.  Portions small though.-Stuffed Sole:  Tried once and only recently.  Did not fill me up, but still good.  Order an appetizer!!-Glazed Chicken:  I know it's a seafood restaurant, but have stopped by for lunch just for their chicken breast.  About 7 total oz and usually have the sauce put on the side.-Calamari and Fried Vegetables:  An oxymoron, but you'll find it all gone before your soup arrives.  Usually gone from me and yes, the only way I will eat vegetables. -Red Lobster Biscuits:  Don't remember the actual name, but this is a must on every visit.  So good and perfect to dip into you chowder. Overall, I recommend Red Lobster. I've never had a bad experience and you get what you pay for her. Price for seafood here is just about right for the quality you get.  Just be prepared for a little wait at this location.Red Lobster is tradition in our family for many celebrations throughout the year such as Mother's day, Birthdays and Anniversaries! My most recent visit was for my Anniversary celebration with my sweetheart and it was a real feast!You know what to expect from Red Lobster however we were pleasantly surprised to see that they remodeled inside making the space more open and welcoming!We really like the more modern and contemporary setting they designed the previous space into.The food is always great, starting off with fresh cheddar bay biscuits, fresh salads, yummy drinks and appetizers.We always get great service and great food on our visits here so the consistency is there for sure!I attached photos of our yummy dishes and drinks that really satisfied our taste buds and bellies!The Lobsterita drink has always been a favorite of mine and I really enjoyed the pre meal buzz and warmth it gave me this time!The sweet chili shrimp appetizer I am still dreaming about! (lol)Awwwww, Cheddar Bay Biscuits! Really, what more can I add to Cheddar Bay Biscuits?  Those things must be made with crack because you will be addicted after the first bite.  Yummy!Ok, ok, now to the review!  Red Lobster is an A-OK restaurant in my book.  I don't visit it often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal.  It isn't fancy, but it sure is tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable for what you get.  They often have great specials, like the 4 course meal for $14.99.  And the best part, unlimited Cheddar Bay BiscuitsI   RL also has some great lunch specials for when you want something smaller and cheaper.  Most of the lunch specials are $7.99, which is pretty good for some seafood.   I always feel like I got a great deal when the bill arrives for lunch or dinner.  The menu is pretty big and quite diverse as well.  If you like shrimp, you are in luck because there always seems to be at least a dozen different types of shrimp.  They also have lots of other seafood options to suit everyone in your group.  Don't like seafood?  That's ok too, because they have steak, chicken, and beef options as well.  Everyone should be happy in your party.  If anything, everyone can just eat the unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  Have I mentioned how amazing those suckers are yet? Yum!The food over all is ok.  The dishes are ok.  Nothing is really special or outstanding, but it gets the job done.  The super highlight of the menu is the chicken tortilla soup.  It is super duper yummy and I think my favorite thing at RL.  It is a chain restaurant, so at least you always know what to expect, no matter which location you are at.The service here is usually pretty good.  They have a dud or 2 in the service department, but that is everywhere it seems.  I don't require much though, just keep the Cheddar Bay Biscuits coming and my soda filled and I am head over heels happy.  The interior is ok as well.  I know they want to be fancy, but it is still just an ok interior.  This location was recently remodeled though and is looking a lot fresher.So, the moral of the story is that Red Lobster is ok.  And guess what??? I will be back for some more Cheddar Bay Biscuits!
The Good Egg - Ancala=We have breakfast here on Sundays after church.  One of my favorite dishes is the low calorie Power House Burrito (6 Egg Whites, Chicken Breast, Bell Peppers, Chile Peppers, Pico de Gallo, 300 calories), $10.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-scottsdale-7?select=pydMTD8XrHB7urd0dZWh0Q#pydMTD8XrHB7urd0dZWh0QI can't believe this thing is only 300 calories!  However, I think it's legit because despite it's size, I don't leave the restaurant feeling stuffed....just satisfied.The servers here are really friendly and always on top of their game.  That's why we come here frequently.Return Factor - 90%
Tasty Kabob=Just went there this past Saturday and was impressed with the food and atmosphere. The only sad thing was how empty it was - both for the owners (who are very nice) and the people that are missing out on it. By comparison, Pita Jungle next door was packed and I seriously doubt the food is any cheaper or better, not to mention the atmosphere. We had a bunch of appetizers and ordered the koobideh as a side item - it was a lot of food. The persian salad and the hummus were both huge, enough for 3 people at least. It was fresh and delicious - try it, you'll be glad you did!If your business says you are open until 9:30pm, then you should be taking customers.  If not, lock your doors.  We arrived at 9:15pm and asked if food was being served as we could sense a hesitation in the greeting.  She went to "check".  Afterwards, another woman came out (the head honcho) and told us, "We can serve you, but you'd have to be out by 10:30 (with a straight face and looked us in the eye).  My friend looked at me to see what I was thinking.  I was already on my way out the door.  That was highly disrespectful.  There is a way to talk to people.  Just say your kitchen is closed.  I don't tolerate ANY level of disrespect from ANY establishment.  So maybe your business is doing THAT well that you feel you don't need new customers.  (I don't think any business is is in that position, especially nowadays).  I don't care what you're serving up in there, no thanks.  There are way too many places to eat...pause.Anyone who is looking for authentic, Persian cuisine - stop looking! Tasty Kabob is by far the best establishment I've been to across the country. My fiancé ordered a dinner entree of lamb kabob skewers, basmati rice and salad. I ordered a chicken kabob and kufta kabob (koobideh in Farsi, minced ground beef in English) with basmati rice and salad. There is a nice lady who greets you and takes care of your order when you first arrive; I found out later she is the owner. So when I asked for the regular kufta kabob plate (2 skewers) - she recommended I try a mixed plate instead. She was right! The mix of chicken and kufta gave it such a better taste than kufta by itself. There is a short wait time (thank God) because we had just left the gym and we were famished. Happy as hell that we didn't have to wait a long time, we devoured our plates. It was absolutely delicious, and I cannot forget to mention how huge the portion is. I just wish I took my usual pictures for my fellow Elites and Yelpers so you all can run over here tomorrow. And whomever ends up coming here, send me notes and post the pictures! You won't regret it.
King Buffet 2000=This is one of those establishments that make me wish that we were allowed to give ratings in 1/2 star increments. The location (Papago Plaza, on McDowell and Scottsdale Rd.) is excellent; the restaurant is easy to find and parking is more than ample. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The buffet offerings are one gustatory delight after another. I wanted to go for seconds for almost every dish, and knew I shouldn't because there were so many to try. You get more seafood offerings here than in most buffets, and I like that they offered fried, baked, and poached fish dishes. The dishes I found outstanding: the fried chicken, the ceviche (with tostadas!), and pretty much all the shrimp dishes. Rand H., Mike C. and I kept commenting to each other how good each of the things we got was. However, two of my favorite dishes in buffets were a disappointment here: the sushi was very bland, and the squid was rubbery-chewy. Also, although the buffet serving area was very brightly lit, I found the main dining area to be too dim; the dimness level was such that some candlelight on the tables would have been a nice and practical touch. These are the few things that prevent me from giving this buffet restaurant the full five stars. Still, the meal was very enjoyable and  in my buffet list I consider this establishment to be one for repeat visits. Four and a half stars.
Taylor's Chowder House=O.K.  I made a visit albeit still skeptical.  I absolutely must point out first and foremost that anyone who views this as a good destination for anything related to New England OR Seafood is one of three things.1. Owners of the restaurant2. never had good seafood before3. never had good seafood beforeThe clam chowder is a pasty concoction that does not begin with bacon/salt pork, has bits of chewy rubbery clams, is tasteless, and overall would recieve a boost with the addition of a couple of cans of Snow's.The fried clams were horrible.  The only plus was that they were not strips.  They were actually "Bellied" clams but I use that term VERY loosely.  Price will always determine the quality when it comes to clams.  they cost a certain amount of money and there is no way to get around that.(unless of course youre not using Ipswich Clams)  There is no way that these are from Ipswich Shellfish Co.  The batter is terrible as well.  Why would anyone choose to fry a clam in anything but an evaporated milk/corn flour dredge??Any new englander who has had a good chowder from legal, Sole, etc. or a clam from the clam box, essex, or Ronnies knows that this place is not your fried clam destination.Wait!  i almost forgot.  the tarter sauce was horrible as well.  Can i give zero stars??
Midwestern Meats=This place is 3 stores in one, a restaurant, a bakery and a meat market.  I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars and meat market 5+stars.I've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation a couple friends and I went for a prime rib dinner.  My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there.  No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving.  We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato and a dessert.  The soup was some sort of cream soup that was so gelatinous the spoon stood straight up in the sticky glop, yuck!  Thank God the prime rib was brought out quickly, it was FANTASTIC!  Medium rare, tender, tasty in it's own juice.  Delicious!  It's a good thing we weren't hungry for dessert, it was some sort of pudding that had the same gelatinous appearance as the soup earlier.  Gross.I've only stopped through the bakery once for some cookies.  Everything is made fresh daily and they'll take special requests for anything including sugar free and low fat items.  Go here for the meat.  I won't even buy grocery store beef since shopping here.  They'll cut anything and everything to your preferences and needs.  They are so helpful and friendly and the best part is the quality of the beef.  Everything is well marbled, fresh and fresh cut and it tastes 100 times better than anything I've bought in a grocery store.  Prices are beyond reasonable especially considering the level of service they provide.  Between this place and the Superstition Ranch Market down the street, I rarely have to shop at a grocery store.
Bobbie's Cafe of Sun City=What a find for a good old American Breakfast!  Right at Bell and 99th Ave.We went for breakfast, but their lunch/dinner menu looks pretty good too - the place ought to be featured in Diners, Driveins and Dives - tho this is certainly not a dive.I had country fried steak (made with certified Angus Beef) with sausage gravy, two eggs, fresh fruit (or hash browns) and toast for $7.99.  Jo-Ann was more conservative - two eggs. toast and hashed browns for $3.99 ($1 more on the weekend, I think).  The food was excellent.  Nothing fancy, just good food with decent serving size at a great price.Some lunch/dinner choices - 1/3 lb Angus Beef cheeseburger for $5.49, Chicken Cordon Bleu with sides for $8.99, Fish & Chips for $7.49.  I'm ready to go back!And don't let the "Sun City" stop you - this morning the ages were all over the place from teens to seniors.
Pane e Vino=A good friend of mine recommended this place.  He said it was one of the best restaurants he's been to....since he's never steered me wrong, we decided to make the drive up to Pinnacle Peak to give it a try.  I'm glad we did...It was mid-week and when we arrived, it was very slow.  We were seated in the dining room and there were only 2 other tables there.  We were beginning to wonder if we had the right place.After browsing the menu, we decided to order:Caprese (Fresh Tomato & Mozzarella Appetizer) $10.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=hD15mxhKV-yWyU9iyYSFjgCarpaccio di Manzo (Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vingarette) $11.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=BOaF8AVIQFJzYGdNXfqaVwGnocchi Ponte Vecchio (Potato Dumplings, Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce) $15.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=A0_HsEQNDFSbZinp4yoqkQRavioli di Zucca (Butternut Squash Ravioli, Walnut Gorgonzola Cream Sauce) $17.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=3OI-0dzP0xwu1KNDKg7uEgAnd for dessert....Tiramisuhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A?select=AaXI7XufOAU0KVaXVoR7_gThe Gnocchi was amazing and the Carpaccio was awesome.  The Butternut Squash Ravioli was perfectly flavored and the sweet taste of the Squash went well with the sharp taste of the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce.Overall, it was a great meal.  What a hidden gem!

Polaris Street Cafe=I called and ordered the country scram for breakfast & this time they got it right-2 scrambled eggs over 2 biscuits covered in sausage gravy with hashbrowns & 4 strips of bacon. $6 and they delivered!! It was good with the hashbrowns this time.Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I went to the Polaris Street Cafe for breakfast this morning.  Never judge a book by its cover!  From the outside you think, "This is the place Ben recommended?"  Once inside, it's a totally different world.  Red and white checked tablecloths on the tables, movie posters, and photos of old actors and actresses on the walls, and a very friendly staff.I took a seat and a server brought me a menu and asked about something to drink.  I ordered coffee and he brought me both coffee and a glass of ice water.  The coffee was promptly refilled while I was there.I had seen the menu online and I knew they had a good breakfast selection.  I ordered the Ranchero omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with pieces of sausage, green chilies, avocado,  cheddar cheese, and topped with a ranchero sauce.  It comes with fried potatoes and toast or biscuit.  In my case, I ordered rye toast and they asked if I wanted it buttered or not.While waiting, I was surprised by the number of calls they got for delivery.  It seemed like someone was always on the phone taking an order.  In a short time, a server brought my breakfast and asked if I wanted any hot sauce.  Cholula, of course.  I was all set.The breakfast was excellent.  Hearty and really more than I should have eaten even letting the plates go with some of the toast and potatoes unfinished.  The restaurant has three rooms.  Two larger rooms and one small room off to the north of the building.  This is a warehouse, business section of town so there are bars over the windows and on the door.  Don't be fooled by the cover.  The book is great!  Thanks Ben!  I owe you.  Maybe breakfast at the Polaris?
Dazzo's Dog House=These hot dogs were gooood and I don't particularly care for hot dogs.  I had a chubby: mustard, grilled onions, peppers and fries. Damn it was good. I couldn't finish it though.  We split some onion rings and they were too greasy.  The dipping sauce for the onion rings was rare like all-the-condiments-in-the-fridge-mixed-together kind of rare. Don't get a chubby in the car.  Don't take your chubby home. Get a chubby there and eat it there.
Defalco's Italian Grocery=Aside from the wait to order and the other wait to get your food, Defalco's rocks!  I was there for a late lunch on Friday and I opted to forgo my usual salad choice and go for the eggplant parm sandwich - yum!  Each bite of perfectly crusted eggplant had the most amazing tangy tomato sauce and melted cheese and it was oh so dlvine!  I had it on wheat bread and finished my entire sandwich (and yes, I ordered a full size!)  What a treat!  Don't try to special order at Defalco's - Jared attempted to create his own sandwich and what he ended up with was nothing close to what he ordered.  I can't wait to go back to 'make my own pizza' - i know about that thanks to Max A!  I have a feeling that I'll be visiting Defalco's quite a bit since I'm now living in the area after a recent move.  It's a good thing - well, it's a tasty thing, maybe not so good for the waistline!Sorry, Defalco's - I have to take a star off for you always being so slow!  Really, every time I've been, there is a long wait - and your food is worth it, but isn't there a way for you to speed things up?The register is old school and it always take forever to ring in an order... and then I have no clue what kind of system you use to prepare food and bring it out, but for the number of employees you have working, there's got to be a faster way?!Bottom line - if you are not in a hurry, and you want some good food - go to Dafalco's!I had the eggplant parmisian sub thing. Holy god. I've only been there once and it was a long time ago but I remember thinking "Why am I such a super-human moron? Why don't I eat here regularly?" Strangely, God responded. Some joke about me falling down the tree and hitting every branch. You know how it goes... I did not experience the extreme wait times that other people mention but that would really annoy me depending on my mood. Yet another reminder I'm not self-actualized.The place for lunch.I'm happy whenever I work in Scottsdale as that usually means lunch at DeFalco's.  This place is an institution in this part of town and the consistent crowds attest to its reputation.The philly cheese steak sandwich is so good that I rarely get up the courage to try something else.I guess I have to review Defalco's Italian Grocery now that Brian S has posted a pic of me loving up on a package of polenta...Brian and I rolled across the street from D'Lish and grabbed a few things at Defalco's.  I had a half steak sandwich (a grinder if you've lived north of New Haven, CT) and I'm fairly certain it was the best steak sandwich I've had since moving to Phoenix.Defalco's is the kind of place I really miss from the Boston area.  Down to earth guys, a variety of good Italian deli meats, salads, cheeses, a nice selection of Italian grocery items, and great sandwiches.If only it were closer to my house I would probably be here at least once a week.Last night my friend came over to watch the Dexter season finale and we decided to pick up food from Defalco's. We decided to each pick something and share.  I got the cheesesteak- brilliant.He got an egg salad sandwich- idiot.I was pissed I had to share with him.Seriously, never agree to share your cheesesteak.  It is just too good.   On a side note, their egg salad is just fine. It's just not that good when you have all these flavors from a cheesesteak dancing around in your mouth. Also, their sandwiches are larger than my head. I have a big head, so that is saying a lot.1/07/10My first visit here was maybe 3 or 4 years ago w/ a friend, and we'd intended to try dinner and perhaps split a pastry.  However, after looking over the dessert display case, we decided to have a pastry tasting party, instead!  My fave pastries that day (and we had sampled 6 or more, maybe 8, different varieties!) were the chocolate-chip studded cannoli and napoleon.  His was, of course, his fave Italian pastry, the sfogliatelle.  I remember it having a lemon cream filling and not enough of it.  But he was happy with it, and that's all that mattered.  Fast-forward to last month, I decided to try their stuffed shells, $9, which came w/ 5 shells, a side salad, and garlic bread.  Salad was your basic salad w/ olives and a pepperoncini, but I liked the generous portion and how fresh and crisp it felt and tasted.  The foil-wrapped garlic bread was nothing to rave about (I didn't even bother to take a picture of it after I had a bite!).  The jumbo shells were very good- loved the ricotta filling and the melty cheese on top!  However, had I known that the dish came w/ marinara sauce, I'd have requested it be omitted.  Not that it didn't taste great- it did, if not a bit too salty, but I do better w/ cream-based rather than tomato-based sauces.Can't wait to try more from the menu!(Had great pics to add here, but for some reason the "add photo" link was missing!)When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!Un@$%!ing believable cheesesteak! I just want to admit something, and I'm not ashamed about it. I went to DeFalco's two days in a row for that sammich. Seriously, it's that good. From the bread to the perfect amount of cheese, it's definitely the best cheesesteak sandwich I've had in the 5+ years that I've been here in the valley. The only thing that upsets me about it is that now I'll have a hard time trying some of the other items on the menu.From the reviews I have read, a lot of people have long waits when eating here, but I did not. I think if you can work around peak restaurant hours, you shouldn't have much of a problem. Also, the staff was pretty nice to my group and me. I'm addicted. There I said it. DeFalco's brings the East to the Southwest, and it does pretty perfectly. It's a must if you've moved from back East and want a little taste of home, or if you've never been out that way and you want a little taste of what you're missing.Bravo!10/27/10Had I not have to wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches, I'd easily give this meal 4 stars.  Looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted, I'd like to visit again soon, but recalling how long my wait was, and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook (that took my order) and another whom I thought was either an owner or a manager, I am very hesitant on returning.  :(  I did enjoy the sandwiches, especially the cheesesteak, even though half-way through my half-sandwich, I decided it was a little too salty.  I thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich, creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant!  Loved munching on the hefty wheat roll, but I didn't care much for the soft white roll that the parm rested on.Up until yesterday, I was planning on completing my draft of an effusive, glowing, 5-star review for Defalco's.  Yes, it was going to be a wonderful description of how much I love the food, blah, blah, blah...That was until I waited 35 minutes for a cheesesteak.  35 minutes.  For a sandwich.  No, it wasn't during the lunch rush.  In fact, there were only 4 other people in the store.  I walked right up to the counter to order, as there was not a line (a first!).  And then proceeded to wait.  And wait.  And wait some more.  35 minutes, to be exact, thanks to the time-stamp on my receipt.I have been to Defalco's on more occasions than I can count, and know to expect a longer than average wait.  Hey, quality takes time.  I get it.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every item I have tried there - pizza, calzone, cold sandwiches, deli items and of course my personal favorite, the cheesesteak.  My partner in culinary crime counts their food, especially their four-meat combo sandwich, among his favorite things.  Unfortunately, 35 minutes for one sandwich in a practically empty place is ridiculous enough to make me re-think my formerly 5-star opinion.This was my second time this week to experience DeFalco's. To say I was underwhelmed both times would be an understatement.The first time was when we ordered pizza for friends that were coming over for the evening. Our friends were excited because DeFalco's was a place they had heard really great things about and couldn't wait to try their food. the pizza though was just so-so. The sausage and pepperoni one was better than the vegetarian one because the meat added some flavor to the whole thing but the veggie one was bland. No one was impressed...My dad has been going here for years though and he said their sandwiches are what they are famous for so I forgave the sub-par pizza and tonight we decided to see what all the hoopla was about. I'm sorry that we did...1. I don't have a problem with surly restaurant employees... I was a surly barista for years but I have a problem with rude asshole workers. My husband and I walked up to the counter and this guy turns and complains to his co-worker about all the people coming in. Really dude??? People buying food here is what keeps you employed! He then bitches again about the same thing as I am attempting to order. AND he won't even acknowledge that I am the one ordering and will only make eye contact with my husband. Like I wasn't there. 2. My husband ordered the Greek Veggie Sandwich. We got home with the sandwich and as he was checking it out he notices that it has only one piece of feta on the whole 12 inch sandwich. And one cherry tomato on each sandwich half. The rest of it is just cucumber and onions. That's it. So he was essentially given a cucumber sandwich. Lame.3. My dad and I split a whole Combo sandwich. It was okay. Not great. I've had better sub sandwiches.  My dad says that the sandwiches were not like he remembered in the past and that this time they really seemed to skimp on the meat. In the past he and his girlfriend had split the same sandwich and it was almost too much for them both. That was not the case tonight. The only positive thing I have to say is that one of the people with us got a tuna sandwich and they said it was really great. She also thinks Top Ramon is good though so take her review as you wish.Sorry to say that I don't think I will visiting this establishment again. And my friends that wanted to try the sandwiches... I'll be encouraging them not to bother.Defalco's is half sandwich place, half italian grocery, full on tasty tasty italian flavor.I took an Arizona native here because he had never heard of it before (gasp!) even thought I believe it has several locations over Tempe-Scottsdale area. The guy at the counter suggested I try any of the hot sandwiches as they, in his opinion, have more flavor than the cold ones.I ordered a full (also available in half, but really who would ever do that) sub with sausage and peppers. The sausage is made in-house and tasted super fresh. The peppers and onions are soft and well-cooked and the toppings are swimming in a sea of marinara sauce (which is also made in house). Now the real challenge is eating it. Or, eating it without looking like a murder victim in a crime scene. I had marinara sauce in my elbows, ears, nose and any available crevice you can think of get your mind out of the gutter already). Everything came piping hot and it was incredibly filling at around $7. Score.Now on my way out I made the horrible (cough wonderful) mistake of passing by their dessert display and purchased a giant piece of caramel topped NY cheesecake (to go). I was like "Oh ill put it in the fridge and we can all share it tomorrow or something". Lies. When they all left to watch a movie (~3hrs later) I took a fork and starting nomming the creamy, thick, delicious cheesecake from Defalcos. "I'll never finish it" I thought. 30 minutes later I was starring at an empty piece of Styrofoam, with the guilt of the world on my shoulders. Damn was that cheesecake good, but I had a lot of explaining to do when the boys came home.Whatever. It was worth it.This Scottsdale institution is epic in every way. Great food, great deli, and great service. If you are in a hurry, the food can take a little while during the lunch rush, so take advantage of calling ahead of ordering so it will be ready when you get there.In addition to the great food, they have deli items for sale, specialty pasta, bread, wine, etc. Everything you need to be a hero in the kitchen. The one thing that's a bit odd are the signs on the soda fountain admonishing people not to steal soda, if they have a free water cup. That seems more like a sign you'd see in a Circle K in a shitty area- not a great deli. Maybe they can lose the sign, it kinda isn't in keeping with the classy feel of the food, ambiance and people.Everything is pleasant here from the people to the ordering to the taste of the food. I've had a Philly Cheese steak in the heart of Philadelphia and it didn't even come close to the heavenly sandwich found here at Delfalcos.Also, its HUGE! I couldn't finish mine but it was even good heated up the next day. I cant wait to come back to try their pizza and some more of their salads. They also have a large selection of wines, pastas and various other snacks so Its a great place to do some shopping for home while you wait for your food to be prepared. The owners are great, really cant wait to come back for more!I'll be honest with you. I found out about this place from my Twitter feeds. They are big Sun Devil fans and a lot of my fellow Devils stop by this place. So of course I had to bookmark and try this place. Walking in there's shelves of Italian groceries but in between are tables to sit at. Inside are usually tables for two but outside they have bigger tables. So you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. So I ordered a half meatball and half beef cheesesteak with grilled onions, peppers, and mushrooms with a Latte. I'm always looking for the best meatball sandwich in town and would have to put this at the top of my list. Freshly baked and toasted bread with two huge meatball and fresh mozzarella. Man this all came together. So good. So fresh. Loved it. The beef cheesesteak with thinly sliced ribeye was so good. The beef was so tender and juicy with that creaminess of the cheese and fresh mozzarella with peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Oh my goodness. Freaking good. Hit the spot. To top it off the latte just made this lunch to freaking over the top. Loved it. My daughter and wife split a full meatball sandwich which they couldn't finish. Plus they ordered a cannoli. Oh my goodness. We all took a bite of that cannoli it was so good. Out of this world. So creamy. So good. You just have to try this. My son ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and he really liked it. Finished it all up. I really liked this places. The tables are small but the atmosphere was great. Great food. Good and friendly service plus they are Sun Devils. So Forks Up and enjoy
Michael's Pub=Let's seee. Do I really want to watch the Charger game on a little ass plasma TV while other NFL games are shown in a room full of Dolphin (yuck), Broncos (ew), Cowboys (double ewl), and 49er fans (yikes) at a sports book back at the hotel? Orrrrrr go off the strip and chill with fellow members of the charger nation with the game projected on a big screen? Let's hop in a cab and head down to Michael's Pub. We had to bust out the GPS from the iphone to help the cab driver find this place. After declining to go to the strip club suggested by the cab driver 100 times, we finally found MP in a small strip mall. Moments after we walked up in the joint, I instantly knew we made the right choice of coming here. Charger fans everywhere, wall to wall of the small bar. During the 1st quarter, 6 Raven fans decided to come into charger territory. SD fans were really cool and respectful to them, but we had to let them know it was our house they entered. Boo birds sure gave them a warm welcome, and the chants sure made them feel uncomfortable throughout the game. "BALTIMORE: SUCKSSSS!!""RAVENS: SUCKKK!""YOU: SUCK!"I think the "GET THE FUCK OUT" Chant scared them off by halftime. Despite our 1st loss of the season, I'm sure we will meet Baltimore ravens deep in the post season! Chargers will always have the last laugh, because "THATS JUST HOW WE SPROLES!!!"CHARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!Booths everywhere. Guys and gals everywhere. Great drink specials! You can feel how everyone is "Chaaarrged" up. You can feel the electricity through the place! Excitement is everywhere....ok I'll stop talking about the stripclub, I'm supposed to be reviewing Michaels Pub.This place rocked! Felt right at home with all the Charger fans. Jerseys everywhere!GOOD:- Food and drink specials. Chicken wings, burgers, sandwiches, fries- Free food at half time!- Charger love everywhere u look- Hardcore fans, bandwagon fans, ceiling fans..they got it all!- Tvs everywhereBAD:- Small bathroom. All that beer makes you pee! Only 2 stalls- Bar located 5.5 miles off the strip (if you don't have a car, cab fare adds up)- Got pretty hot in there. All the body heat made the temperature riseUGLY:- Last two plays of the game! Can we get some better play calling please?- Can someone please block Ray Lewis!?..why he gotta smash my boy Sproles like that!- Raven fans who rolled up in there, we showed them (even though they got the last laugh)Overall, we had a blast. Being in vegas, cheering on your home team with a bunch of Charger fans is the real deal!If you ever in Vegas and want to watch a Charger game, go to Michaels Pub! exSPROLESive!!!
La Palapa=La Palapa is a Mexican seafood restaurant on the north side of town offering incredibly fresh underwater fare at incredibly affordable prices. I insist that you start with a Modelo Especial served michelada style, or 'preparado' ($4). This is a light Mexican beer laced with hot sauce and fresh lime juice, served ice cold in a massive salt rimmed goblet. Sounds strange, I know, but once you try it you'll be hooked. I actually had a similar drink served to us in a plastic cup at the HUGE Broadacres swap meet on the north end LVB, which I also recommend for delicious cheap eats, but this is the first time (and certainly not the last) I've had it in a restaurant.Then, you should order the fish taco ($3). This was primarily desirable to me because of the price, but once it came to the table I knew I wouldn't be let down. It needed a shot of acidity (may I recommend their house salsa, a dash of Tapatio, and a squeeze of lemon?) but the beer battered fish was hot, crispy, and oh so good.The entree of shrimp served "a la palapa" (I love saying their name, try it!) came to the table looking one note and blonde, and not in the appealing sort of way men like. I was amazed, however, after taking the first bite of snappy, sweet shrimp. It was flavored with bay leaves and some sort of dried pepper, and tasted fantastic, especially when bundled up in a warm tortilla with their great refried beans and rice.I also very much enjoyed the combination tostada of octopus (pulpo) and shrimp (camaron) ($3.75). There aren't many places outside of the Mediterranean you can get great octopus, but this was fantastic considering our desert surroundings. It was tender, yet firm, and very fresh. In fact, none of the seafood I've had here has been anything but fresh, so if you like offerings of the sea but don't want to drown in debt, La Palapa should be on your 'must visit' restaurant list.PS. Do you like flan? Then don't pass on dessert. La Palapa's version is as creamy as cheesecake. I'm generally a poster child for self-restraint when it comes to over-indulging in foods that are very bad for you (I'm part foodie, part health nut), but I can only attribute that to my strict evaluation of whether or not something is worth the calories. The flan here most certainly is, so I left only a token bite.
Villa Deli=Villa was our third choice for lunch today. The other two were closed. I am glad they were. Ryan C and I arrived -slightly after- 12:00 because he is always -slightly after- whenever he is supposed to be there, and there was a healthy crowd but plenty of room to sit. There are about 10 tables with about 4 seats a piece. They have a great selection of Boars head meats but the kicker is the bread. Made fresh daily. it really can make a huge impact on the food. I opted for the spaghetti and meatballs dinner with salad and bread. They were out of something for the salad, so I ended up with Ala carte. It was a nice portion of spaghetti and two meat balls. The MB were not huge but not too small either, about 1.5 to 2 inches round. They were homemade and tasted great. No mushy texture just great seasonings. The sauce was excellent. Nice flavor and they didn't skimp om the sauce. I had to have something for the bread to soak up. The bread was a slightly smaller then a softball sized roll. Great crust and soft interior. The bread could have been warmed up to allow the cold butter to spread but I will ask them next time. One cool thing is they have kits for pizza and for pasta. Sort of a do it yourself thing. The pizza could be a fun time for kids or creative adults just the same. I grabbed a frequent diner card because I will be back.Dig it.  3.5 stars.  The chicken parm was decent portion for decent price, but I'm not getting my friend's Italian gramma on the phone or anything.The sauce was the best part, sweet and basily.The daily fresh baked bread (they call a Smiley) was great, but should have been served warm, not fridge cold, in order to appreciate its flavor and texture.  I will go back, but I will have to try out some other items, such as the array of hot or cold sammiches, before I can say I'm a fan.Reading the history of the place on the back of the menu was a little dry, until getting to the part about some poor schlepp who got shot in the restaurant in a previous location and then a few years later plummeted his car over a cliff edge.  Weird.
Jasmine Express=I come here at least once a week for my lunch break. They have lunch specials from 11am-3pm ranging from $6-$8, but I come here for the Combination Pho. I think it's the best dish they offer. This is probably the only place that serves Pho on this side of town.Call ahead to order your food, because they take a long time.this place is a joke... I came in and ordered 2 smoothies and they made me wait 25 minutes for 2 drinks... they gave us a straw that had sticky substance on it... WTF. it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies weren't even tasty. NEVER COMING BACK.This restaurant rates. #1 on the worst Chinese fast food list in the country. I have lived in many places and in many states and this "restaurant" is the worst. We ordered Crab Rangoon & General Tso chicken. The crab rangoon was very small, overcooked and had a smear of who knows what in it. The General Tso chicken had something that resembled paint thinner and smelled like it too. The chicken was the cheapest quality a restaurant could buy. For fear of spending the weekend in the hospital I stuck to the overcooked crab rangoon and some rice. I was desperate!If you have the iron stomach and complete lack of taste buds to try the food here you might want to avoid the duck sauce. That was nastier than the paint thinner, er the chicken.You know a place is not doing so well when they offer deals that are too good to be true. Free eggroll with yelp check-in and buy one get one free drink? We paid less than $10 and ended up with 2 drinks and a box of eggroll. SERVICEI was disgusted by the rude servers here. They seemed nice at first but as soon as they saw me check-in on yelp, they kept demanding me to write a review for them. No.I sat down at one of their sticky and nasty table then they yelled out "you write review? I need to see it" When I went to the counter to pick up my order, they snatched my phone from my hands and started scrolling through my yelp profile. "where is the review? you didn't write it? omg no why" First of all, you have no right to touch my belonging and second of all, it's invasion of my privacy for you to be looking through my phone. I am done with their trashy and unprofessional employees. FOOD/DRINKSI don't know what their vegetable eggroll was made out of but it was inedible. Straight to trash. Boba milk tea? or did they mistake this for sugar milk tea? perhaps they added a whole bag of sugar in my 24oz milk tea because I didn't write a review? Either way, I could not drink this. I went home, dumped half of the milk tea, added water and I was finally able to drink this. Took a sip then went straight to trash.Boba was a disgusting mush and had absolutely no flavor or chew.CONCLUSION Never again. Avoid at all cost.
Doña Maria Tamales Restaurant=When trying to decide where to catch the  World Cup game and enjoy lunch central to both our locations, my husband and I settled on Dona Maria. We sat at the bar and ordered a diet coke and my pregnancy drink of choice, raspberry ice tea. The staff was courteous enough, although we waited about 10-15 for the menus to be brought over. The complimentary chips and salsa tasted very complimentary -stale chips and salsa that tasted like marinara sauce. We opted for 6 tamales (pork, beef, cheese, chicken x2 and "sweet").  I had beef and chicken, and thought they were ok but slightly dry. I had to drench them in cholula sauce for added moisture.  Also the tamales were relatively small. The tab was close to $25 which is pretty standard for a mid range quality restaurant. I'd say this was purely a convenience thing and based on the food I would have no desire to go back.
Papago Brewing=The man and I stopped in here last night.  We were starving and beer and pub food sounded just right.I didn't know what I wanted to drink, but I wanted to try something different.  Jeff, our server, helped me out by asking what I like (I typically drink amber ales and some lighter beers that aren't too hoppy) and he brought out a sample of Boont Amber.  It was really delicious, but I was in the mood for something a little lighter.  This time he came back with Wittekerke, a light Belgian Witbier.  It was very tasty and I went with that and my guy got the Orange Blossom Hefe which was excellent also.The food seems to be centered around the pizzas.  Since we were starving and pizzas require 25 minutes (as stated on the menu) we opted for some sliders and a chicken quesadilla.  The sliders were just so-so for me.  They were hard to bite with the meat being so thick and it also wasn't easy to get a bite without having to eat the whole beef piece.  The quesadilla could have been the best I've had - especially with their homemade salsa on the side.  They had other apps and some sandwich selections, but it would have been nice to see a few burgers on there.  Maybe they don't have the equipment.  Who knows...The only slight bummer was the service.  Service for beer was fantastic, but the service for food was only so-so.  It was a pretty low key Wednesday night with not many patrons and it took a while to get a food order in.I love how you can shop from the fridge and even get half gallons of their own brews to go.  They carry the Ephemere Apple which I tried a while ago and enjoy also.  The 30 beers on draft can change daily, so there is always something new to try.  There are an enormous amount of brew options and I can't wait to go back and check 'em out.Who knew that Papago Brewing was hiding in the Papago Plaza just a couple of miles from where i live?  Not me!  I met my new friend Brian M at Papago Brewing Company for a beer yesterday (Friday) around 5pm.  He was sitting at the bar waiting for me when I walked in... and just as I sat down next to him, Jess (the friendly bartender) came over to see what I was drinking.  I told her what I liked, and she brought me a cool tall glass of Orange Blossom, a light American Wheat Ale flavored with Mandarin Orange and Vanilla.  They compare it to a liquid old fashioned creamsicle.  It hit the spot and believe it or not, it gave me a nice buzz too!  Yes, I am a light weight!Jess also brought over a sample of a black cherry beer that I cannot for the life of me remember the name of.  It was sweet and delicious.I'm not a huge beer drinker, but after seeing Beer Wars and now seeing the variety of craft beers that Papago has to offer, I may become one soon.  Well - maybe I should wait until after the wedding - a beer bellied bride probably wouldn't be so cute?!The beer selection for take out is awesome too - next time I need to bring beer somewhere, I'll head to Papago for sure!  If you're looking for a comfortable place to go have a beer, head to Papago... tell Jess I say hello!Mmmmm, the orange blossom beer is worth the trip every time. I dream of this beer. It's like if Blue Moon beer and an orange creamscicle had a baby. The food is also yummy too. Not your typical bar food which I like. My only complaint is that I wish they would serve a cheese dip with the big, soft pretzel instead of mustard. This place gets pretty packed and is loud, so don't expect to carry much of a conversation with anyone. I think this place is a good hang out spot that has a wonderful and large beer selection and great food. I just wish I would have frequented this place more often when I lived in the neighborhood.I really like Papago for the variety - 30 beers on tap and God knows how many in the refrigerator cases. All can be consumed on-site or brought home to stock your personal inventory. What I especially dig is how knowledgeable the staff are about the beer -- even the ones who barely look old enough to drink! I've learned a lot already, from the different types of beer glasses to how some beers are aged and discovering what I like! You can play darts or any of the many board games they've got out. We played Yahtzee on one recent visit. There's a jukebox and a TV for further distraction. The food is OK. Nothing spectacular. Ball park pretzels, thin pizza crust with sauces for dipping, quesadillas, pizzas, etc. There are severely limited options for non-beer drinkers (like 4-5 mediocre wines to chose from and canned/bottled sodas). That said, if you're willing to explore the world of beer - this HAS to be your first stop!**Ladies** try the Lambic Black Cherry Ale. It's so good- and so is the Rasberry Framboise.  This is a cool spot when you want to be casual, and get friendly service. It satisfies my monthly dive bar craving.Wow. This place is superb. It is hard to notice it if you are driving by, and unless you take the leap in and just go for it, you would think its a dive... Oh, but Papago is hardly that!~Fud/DrinkOn my second visit, I had the Orange Blossom beer. I didn't have it the first time, because I was an idiot. Being a non-idiot, I quickly ordered a pint, which subsequently went into my belly super quick. This is my personal favorite beer, no question about it. It is refreshing, yet smooth, has no bite or acidic after taste, and is great by itself or with a dish. Speaking of dishes, they make some mighty tasty bar food. I had a pizza on the first visit, which filled me up and was exceptional. On the most recent visit, I had the red pepper hummus, which surprised me in its above-par flavor. There is a variety of dishes available, all which will fill you up and give your beer a good stomach-fellow. They have so many beers on tap, you would be a fool not to find at least one that suits your fancy. This is a must-go for any beer fan, you will be very satisfied with the options in front of you.~Atmosphere/Service~Like I said, it seemed at first like a dive, being in a strip center without much signage, minus the outside glass job they did to the store-front. Inside is a lot of wood, which gives you the feel for an old-school bar and a Midwestern  feel. It feels inviting, and there more than enough space for you and some friends to chill at. There is also a side room I did not notice until now, that is available if there is a large crowd, so space issues aren't a concern. As for service, it seems to be about average. After waiting about 4 minutes for a server to come to me I simply walked up and ordered instead of waiting and getting upset. Eventually a seat opened up at the bar and the server helped me when I asked for another type of beer. They seem a bit busy, so you do have to ask for their attention. The waitstaff aren't rude, they just seem semi-attentive. I will service gauge this a bit more as I continue to come back. Overall, I am satisfied :)~Extras/Rating~I must suggest finding a seat at the bar if you are coming with another friend. It seems to mean much quicker service and also gives you an idea about selection of beers of course. Please also note the HUGE selection of carry-out beers they have in front of the bar itself. A huge huge selection, which is great if you are not near a Total Wine but want to select your own craft beer six pack. The bonus over Total Wine is that they are all cold! One sad downside is that they only serve the Orange Blossom in a Growler, no six pack avail for any of their beers. Oh well! Five Stars goes out to this place for the quality beers, inviting atmosphere, the tasty bar food that tastes fresh,  the large selection of take out beers, and for the best beer of them all: The Orange Blossom! This is the best brewery I have been to in AZ, its to be determined if another one can carry the weight that Papago has. Come and enjoy!
Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant=KUNG FU KICKED TO 2 STARS   Kung Fu Restaurant broke an important rule. That rule is to NEVER EVER force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check. Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating.   Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.  The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus.   Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table.   The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill.   I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, "The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business." Or the fortune cookie might of said, "You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city." Or the fortune cookie could of said, "There is nothing like competition." To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time.Must have passed this place a million and one times over the last ten years since I came to town and never stopped in. Heard good things about it and fellow colleagues always go, so today me and Ellen F. decide to check it out. Located on the southwest corner in the strip mall on Valley View and Spring Mountain, can't miss it with a name like Kung Fu on the outside. We were seated right away, place wasn't too busy so a waiter took our drink orders promptly. The place looks old school but don't care about that, has a lot of Thai decor with elephants and pictures of the motherland. I get the feeling this place is geared more toward Thai than Chinese but who knows. If you want pad Thai don't fall for the trap and order it from the menu as they offer it as a lunch special for $6.95 Mon-Fri 11am-3pm. I fell for this and ordered the combo pad Thai with an order of rice, it was huge!! Enough for two people. I doubt the lunch portion is as big but still much cheaper and comes with soup or an egg roll. The pad Thai was very good, along with the rice, the quantity was more than enough and the bill was reasonable. We will be returning during lunch hours to take full advantage of the specials. If your looking for a cheap meal in Chinatown with no frills it's worth a stop.
La Perla Cafe=Ha ha. The reviews here are hilarious. So my ex bf and I always go to La Perla. We have drinks and dance the night away here. We are usually the only non Mexicans in the group. When we first started dating, I thought what the hell am I doing here. It grew on me and I love it. The bartenders don't even speak English! We have a fun, unpretentious night here. People are nice and you see another side of life, instead of the typical Scottsdale places I usually frequent. It makes me remember who I am and that I can have a blast anywhere.La Perla Café is family owned/operated and has been around for YEARS. I went there with my wife Carol for dinner. Carol got the #23 combo (Tostada, enchilada & a taco) she totally devoured her meal so I know she liked it. When she was done there was nothing left on her plate. I got the Cimichanga dinner w/ rice and refried beans. My entrée was mouthwatering scrumptious. It was well-prepared, flavorful and came out sizzling hot. OMG, the food is SO GOOD here, all the way down to their terrific salsa!  Every bite of it was just stellar!Outstanding Mexican comfort food. Excellent service from Sandra, our waitress. This place is has excellent food and the prices are reasonable in addition the quality is top notch.One of the other greatest parts of the meal was the 3 different salsas they serve with their home made chips. They come in small carafes with the food.  All three salsa were extremely flavorful in a way totally unique to La Perla Café. Their salsa unlike most places is less spicy and more flavorful. Its also not so thick. If you love Mexican food you really owe it to yourself to check out La Perla. FOOD: Top quality Mexican food - MUY DELICIOSO!!! SERVICE: The people are very nice, helpful and caring. They truly want you to enjoy the food they make for you. PRICE: Comparable to other Mexican restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. CONCLUSION: AMAZING FAMILY OWED MEXICAN RESTAURANT! A truly wonderful establishment. I cant believe how long its been around and how nice and hospitable everyone there was. I love supporting independent, family run business.  Props to La Perla Café for staying authentic through the years. If you love Mexican food definitely  visit this restaurant. RETURN FACTOR 100%. ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH
Apple Spice Junction=We order from Apple Spice here at the office at least once per week. It started out just one or two of us, and has grown into five or six, surely more to jump on board! They do these things called "box lunches" where you get a side (pasta/potato/frog eye salad or chips), a pickle, a treat (normally a cookie) and condiments including mustard, mayo, lettuce and tomato. The wide variety of sandwiches are either 6.95 or 7.95 and include all of the above. If you are an Amazon, or just eat like one (Me, that's right, guilty as charged) you can get the "executive box" for $2 more... and it includes all of the above PLUS a side of veggies (carrots, broccoli, celery, black olives, etc) with a side of ranch, a bag of chips and cheesecake.!!!! So, for $8.95 I am stuffed out of my mind and so happy because the egg salad that I get every time is always moist and flavorful, and I really love the sourdough bread it comes on! Some of the other girls from the office religiously order the Roast Beef Deluxe and Breast of Turkey, as well. f you order a minimum of three lunches before 10:30am, they will deliver for you :) We normally don't start thinking about lunch until then, so we always forget, but we call and place the order and its ready for pickup about fifteen minutes later. Easy! I would definitely use them for catering should the need arise! Way to go Apple Spice!!
Super Burrito=I've driven past this place several times and finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  After browsing their menu, I decided to order:Carne Asada Burrito, $4.75http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw#eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJwBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $4.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ#WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQWhile I waited for my food, I went to load up on Salsa.  They have a typical Salsa Bar that you find out here in the Phoenix area Taco shops.  I tried the spicy Salsa and the roasted Peppers Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA#qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg#AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQgAfter a short wait my food was ready.  The Burritos are pretty large and come with Chips...that was an unexpected bonus.  Before I jumped into the Burritos, I tried the Chips...they were stale, yuck.I then went for the Carne Asada Burrito....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  There was very little flavor to it.  Ok, another bite....and then another.  Wow, this was the blandest Carne Asada Burrito I've ever had.  Another unique thing was that the Burrito had grilled Onions and Salsa in it....very runny for a Burrito like this.  However, that didn't help with the flavor at all.  As a matter of fact, I only ate 1/2 of it.Next, I tried the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito....again, it was underwhelming and bland.  I poured the spicy Salsa and Roasted Peppers Salsa on it to give it some flavor....that was it's only saving grace.Overall, it was a very disappointing dining experience.  Oh well, it happens sometimes.Return Factor - 2%
Haji-Baba=If you want an authentic experience, if you really want to feel like you have some manner of ethnic experience, you need to come to Haji Baba.  It's a little middle-eastern market.  It's a corner grocery.  It's a family-run restaurant.  It's freaking good.  The hummus is pretty good, with fresh-made pita.  The feta cheese app is really good.  The chicken shawerma plate is top-notch, and my god is there a ton of food.  Heck, order the gyros plate for around $6 and when it arrives, mounds of succulent meat, tzsaziki sauce, rice and Greek salad, go ahead and take a bite before you decide to pull a Johnny Depp from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and go back to kill the cook because it's just too good.  It's cheap, it's filling, it's quality, and it's ridiculous that it's not packed from open to close.  Good ol' Haji Baba.You know when you absolutely adore a restaurant and it's like they don't even know you exist? Like you're in some endless John Hughes film where you never, ever get to that final birthday cake scene? I hate unrequited love. But at Haji Baba, the feeling's alllll mutual, baby. No, really. They love me. I swear. Stop laughing. The bestest service, the nicest chitchat and the friendliest not-creepy flirting. And, of course, the most delicious hummus (with a pickle on top).OK, so maybe everyone gets the hummus. But does everyone get a big smile and a compliment from the kitchen staff? Maybe it's because I always stop by after work, gussied up in heels and other lady-things. Maybe it's because I tip on takeout orders. Always. Or maybe it's just because I shop the store like I mean it: canned goods, feta, olives, pita, maybe some naan, baklava, wacky Eastern European chocolate, baba ganoush, spices, pistachios, etc. etc. etc. Not to mention the dirt-cheap, super-tasty kebab, shwarma and koubideh. And while Haji Baba may be the Sam Schoeffling to my Molly Ringwald, Long Duk Dong has never made an appearance during my meal.If you have yet to come to Haji Baba's, then you may not know why almost everyone is in consensus that this place is the bee's knees. I have yet to meet someone who has came to Haji Baba, and been disappointed..in fact I hope i never meet that person, cause they probably suck.HB is THE best place to get mediterranea/middle eastern food. It's fast authentic and cheeeeaaaaappp!The gyros and falafel will run you about ohh idk $2-$3Everything on the menu is under or slightly hovering around/above $10you can come here on a beggars budget and feast like a Turkish Sultan!conveniently located along the lightrail, deliciously prepared like your eating at your grandma's house, and so ridiculously affordable.The market side of HB's is full of goodies as well, be sure to browse on your way out/in.hands down "woohoo! as good as it gets!"i recommend making the people you go with order several things so you can have a bite of everything.everything is good. so good. i think the gyro meat was my favorite, their pitas are so fluffy and soft... like little cushions from heaven sent to earth with the sole purpose of harnessing that delicious meat. i can't even remember everything we had but i know i liked every bite and you will too. we had like 3 days of left overs as well, but we went a little over board in our ordering.If you've ever gyros hopped before, you know that not all gyros are created equal, and until today; if asked, I would have told you my favorite gyros is at Cypress Grill. I am happy to report, opinion changed!I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble. I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of "Personal Favorite - thus far" on it. I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother "Gyros" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)Happy Yelping Phoenix - break outside your bubble once in a while and you'll be surprised at what you can find!
Roaring Fork=One of my fave t-shirts reads "Spooning Leads to Forking." That said, all I can say, is that whatever leads me back to the Roaring Fork is OK with me. A sprawling, rustic space with antler chandeliors (pahleeze, I can't spell that) and a roaring fireplace serving up fantastic New American fare. A perfect spot for a post movie double date. Let's start off in reverse by reviewing the desserts....The banana split, with fried bananas would make even a monkey cry with ecstacy. We were fighting for the last bite. Entrees of roasted duck with sour cherry sauce and sauteed cabbages was delectible. I ate, seriously, every bite. Rickie's fried chicken was juicy and crisp. The seared Ahi tuna with fresh avocado was perfectly prepared. Appetizer fish tacos were fresh, clean and light. All pre dinner salads were crisp and tossed in fantastic dressings. My field green salad, however, was short on beets and the fried goat cheese a bit gummy and luke warm. Service was polite, friendly, although I would enjoy a little more spark and verve from the staff. She seemed like she was sleep walking. Wine list was extensive. Crowd was very family like this evening, with lots of holiday revelery and gift exchange. Great spirited vibe all around. Can't wait to go back. Perhaps I'll wear my t-shirt. Perhaps the server will wake up.Roaring Fork, oh Roaring Fork.  How do I love thee?  Let me counts the ways....1.....  Okay, I guess I don't really love you.  But I do like you, okay? First off, what an interesting location.  I could have been killed getting in the parking lot.  I had a reservation for 8:30.  No, my table wasn't ready at 8:30.  I found that very interesting because there was no one waiting in the lobby.  And wouldn't you know, they seated me by the kitchen.  Okay, folks, I know how long your food was sitting there Friday night and it's not pretty.  Their staff is like a bunch of crazy lunatics, but that's okay.I opted for the Huckleberry Margarita, nice but nothing to write home about.  Doesn't begin to compare with Roy's signature drink, but that's for another review.The bread basket was full of unhealthy little taste treats, I especially liked the bacon & cornmeal bombs and the buttermilk, bacon, artery cloggers.  Yum, yum, even better slathered in chipotle honey butter.  My salad was great, I opted for the wild greens disguised as the iceberg wedge.  I'm a red meat girl, so I had the 8 oz. center cut filet mignon.  Eight is too much for any girl, so I was unable to finish.  But I did order it medium and since it was barely medium rare, I did have to send it back.  Luckily, I was close to the kitchen, so the re-cook didn't take long.  The flavor of the meat wasn't really remarkable, but satisfactory.  The green chile Mac 'n' Cheese is a really great idea and something that I will try to duplicate at home.  If any of you yelpers have the recipe, I would be interested in it.  Now, I'm thinking that since I didn't finish my steak, my server deemed me not worthy of a dessert, it wasn't even offered!  But that's okay, I guess I didn't really need it.All in all, pleasant, but nothing to write home about.Based on the Roaring Fork happy hour last night, I had to update my review, and it was another 5 star experience for sure.  I met my boyfriend there around 6pm, and we waited just about 10 minutes until two seats opened up at the bar... The entire bar area was packed though - it's no secret how fantastic the happy hour prices are at RF!The bar service was perfect - (thanks Ryan) and for a total of $33 before tip, we walked out full from the following:-a glass of Cab Sauv ($5)-a field greens salad with fresh beets, apples, candied walnuts and goat cheese ($5)-fish tacos that came with avocado, tomato, lettuce, salsa ($7)-a half roasted chicken that came with beans, tortillas, avocado, and additional garnish ($12) We were completely satisfied, ambiance was fun (we made friends with our neighbors on either side), and food was phenomenal!  Helpful hint we were told for next time - if you order the salad and ask them to split it in the kitchen, they will put a full goat cheese fritter on both plates!  We're already planning to order that way next time!Thanks for another fantastic meal, Roaring Fork - see you again soon!My experience at the Roaring Fork during Restaurant Week was peculiar.  It's difficult for me not to take on the judgements of my co-diners, but I'm going to try to limit this to my experience only.It took FOREVER to get order our drinks and actually receive them.  All I wanted was an iced tea and I received my drink last, and it was given to my co-diner seated 4 seats away from me.  And, while we were waiting for our drinks to arrive incredibly slowly and one-by-one, I started to get really, really hungry.  I'm waiting for the guy to take our order, but he hasn't even brought all the drinks yet, but he has brought a huge basket of bread.  So I start munching on bread, which was so-so.Finally, he takes our orders for appetizer and entree.  And it takes forever for something of which they probably have a big vat sitting in the kitchen.  But it eventually comes out: 7 green pork chili and a tortilla soup. Except wait a minute, they only brought out 6 green pork chili and a tortilla soup.  So again I wait, and wait, for my waiter to come check on us. 10 minutes or longer after everyone else is served I finally get my appetizer.And it was really good. Tender pieces of pork in a slightly spicy green chili sauce, smothered with a ton of jalapeno jack cheese, served in a little cauldron with three large buttery tortillas.  But it was enough food to be the entree.  If I had known it was going to be this large, I would have ordered the salad.Then it takes awhile for everyone to finish, plates to be cleared and entrees to be brought out.  We were seated at 7:30, it's now close to 9.But then it finally arrives.  My rainbow trout with almond slices and capers with a piece of jalapeno cornbread.  The fish was almost as large as the platter, easily 4 servings if vegetables were included on the platter, but there wasn't.  I'm very curious to find out if this is how they normally serve their food because I'm not used to getting a big plate of meat with nothing else.  Again, it was delicious.  Lightly battered and smokey, it almost tasted meaty it was so rich. This fish was yummerriffic.Then it's time for the dessert, not that any of us have room for dessert, but it's part of the package.  The server informs us that there are only 3 creme brulee left.  Luckily only two of our crowd wanted this dessert, but it was just another way that I was a little disappointed with the service.  I ordered the Chocolate Lava Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was pretty good.  Not phenomenal, but good.I loved my food, and maybe I would check out a happy hour.  It's a shame that the service was so mediocre, because this restaurant could easily have won me over with their food.  And I never would have gone here if it wasn't Restaurant Week.I was so excited to try Roaring Fork for the first time given the positive reviews.  My husband and I met a group of Yelpers for the first time as well.  While we thoroughly enjoyed the company, the restaurant...not so much.Service was marginally acceptable.  While our server took our water order right away, it took a ridiculous amount of time to order any other drinks (except for water) and even a more obscene amount of time to get our dinner order taken.  Where the hell was he?  Taking a class at the Culinary Institute down the street?  There was no logical progression of the dining experience or even the ordering process.  Finally, Houdini arrives with bread.  The  dinner rolls were decent.  There were also some kind of bacon biscuit, but the flavor reminded me more of those "Baco" bacon bits than smokey good-quality bacon.  I ordered off the Restaurant Week menu.  For my starter, I had the green chili pork stew.  Very very good.  Quite a large portion for a starter-would be a fabulous lunch.  Because I wanted to save room for dinner, I refrained from finishing the stew.  Big mistake as my rotisserie chicken was a disappointment.  While it wasn't bad, the chicken was a little dry and  relatively flavorless.  I spent most of my meal focusing on my fond memories of the green chili stew I so foolishly let go.  I did try my husband's trout and it was delicious.  Damn I hate it when he gets a better dish than I do.  The lava brownie for dessert was good, but not as warm as I would have expected either.  I think it was nearing breakfast hour by the time we managed to complete our meal.I'm not certain if the lack-luster experience was due to Restaurant Week or our server lost the coin toss when our group pushed our two tables together.  I will come back and give Roaring Fork another shot, however.  Maybe Houdini will have disappeared for good.  Ahhh, he wasn't that bad, very nice, just not on top of things.I had the opportunity to dine with some Fabulous Fellow Yelpers at The Roaring Fork last night. While the night was fun and full of laughs, The Fork just didn't deliver.Our group of 9 people had a dinner reservation for 7:30pm. Let me first hit on our reservation. Because of seating limitations, Jenn W and I had to make 2 separate reservations, and they were made through Open Table. We each noted our reservation with each other's names and stated that we wanted to be seated next to each other. I also noted that we were Yelp members and that we wanted the AZ Restaurant Week menu.  We received a confirmation etc.The day of our event, I received a phone call confirming our 8PM dinner...umm... no. I explained I set it for 7:30. The girl fumbled around and finally said "Yeah ok." and finally apologized for the oversight. I am SO glad I thought to ask her about the further instructions regarding Jenn W and My table being seated together, because they would have dropped the ball on that too. In my irritation, I finally said "What other important information do you miss because you guys don't actually read your Open Table reservations?" more apologies...yack yack.Fast forward to dinner time!I arrived around 7pm to meet a few Yelpers for drinks at the bar. I didn't feel comfortable actually sitting at the bar because the seats are jam packed right next to each other... heaven forbid there's a fire! It took a while for the bartender to notice that we actually wanted a drink. He served me a fantastic Zin. I don't know what it was, but it was good!Our full party arrived and it was dinner time! I was STARVING at that point. We were seated at 2 separate tables that were next to each other. We decided it was silly to sit a foot away from each other and put some muscle into moving our tables together. Our server, Joshua, took our water order very quickly. Unfortunately, that was about all he did quickly and accurately all night. Our actual drink/cocktail order was painfully slow both in being able to order it and delivery, plus a random diet coke showed up in the midst of our order. At this point we didn't want our drinks we wanted food. A couple of bread baskets were delivered with so-so varieties of bread. My favorite was the cheddar bacon biscuit. It was just interesting to me. After we depleted our carb baskets, we hoped that our food order would fare better and get to us quickly.It was time for the first course. Everyone's first course was delivered except for one. Jenn W was left to sit and wait an unreasonable amount of time for her order. In fact, instead of making sure everyone had what they needed, our waiter delivered another table's appetizer first and walked away. BIG NO NO. Jenn finally received her order and I could finally dig into my food without guilt. I ordered the green chile stew. Fantastic! I loved it. It had the right amount of spicy kick. The meat was tender and not at all fatty, and the tortillas that came with it were hot and buttery. I could have just gone straight to dessert after that. I was very pleased with my appetizer.What goes up must come down right? Well my blissful high was broken up by my boring rotisserie chicken meal. I was hoping that the chicken might be moist and smoky, or maybe rubbed with some interesting spices... no. I know I've had a better seasoned, and more moist rotisserie chicken from a grocery store. Yes, I said it. I did have the chance to steal bites of the trout from Jenn W and Matthew K. How I regret ordering the chicken!! The trout was moist and meaty and full of so much flavor it was silly!! I also had a few bites of Amanda B's short rib dish. The sauce on the short rib was tasty and smoky; the short rib itself was almost too fatty. I know short ribs are supposed to have some fat content, but this was like eating blubber in some bites, not appetizing. I had high hopes for my dessert.Our dinner dishes were finally cleared away and we were left to chat for a bit before our dessert order was taken. I had the molten chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Meh... the brownie wasn't exactly as molten as I expected and considering my ice cream was largely melted I was hoping the whole brownie was warm, nope. The melted ice cream was possibly our "speedy" waiter's handiwork.Our waiter was kind enough to allow split bills and there was no problem in mixed up tabs or anything which was great. I think I will go back to the Roaring Fork for a happy hour or to try some of their more creative dishes. Maybe a basic chicken dish threw them for a loop; I hope they can wow me next time with something different!Happy hour was hopping today, unlike last week.  Bartender Ryan wasn't there, but no worries, as Stefan was just as able and gracious.  I selected the cab to go with the RF "Big Ass Burger," even though I wanted to try the zin.  Did I choose wrong?  I'll try the zin next time.Since I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).If only there are more happy hour meal selections (only two, excluding the salads) for me to enjoy.  Guess I'll be forced to try the Huckleberry bread pudding with creme anglaise and vanilla bean ice cream next time... woe is me ;)How does a fork roar?There is a certain zen quality to that question, much like the ever popular "if a tree falls, yada-yada" (I know, it's not really yada-yada, but you get the idea).I have been to several restaurants lately named with utensil based nomenclature, or named after the place in which the meal was prepared (Kitchen, Wok, etc.). I fully expect that trend to continue, but I think it shows a certain lack of imagination. Sometimes that can be helpful, like "Jimmy's BBQ Pit"...I know it's likely to be BBQ. Simply "Jimmy's Pit" or "Jimmy's" or "Pit" wouldn't be helpful (well, "Pit" might tell you avoid the place). But generally, I like a little romance in the naming...a little something to pique my interest (having said that I still think the food at Hooters is just not up to the name, but that's a discussion for another time).The Beautiful Carin and I headed over to the Roaring Fork for Happy Hour a couple of nights ago and spent a lovely evening at the bar with Clark, the bartender/server/happy hour ambassador. The bar is the place to have a happy hour dinner and couple of cocktails. Tables are fine, but the bar is just a better atmosphere! We hadn't been back for happy hour since Bob McGrath sold the place, but it really hasn't changed (which is a good thing!!). All of our favorites are still solidly on the menu, and the Big Ass Burger is still riding tall at the Roaring Fork Happy Hour! We started with the green chile pork stew and scotch (why yes, they do have one of my favorites...Bunnahabhain...that always puts me in a good mood!).I had the Big Ass Burger... it truly is a big ass burger and really tasty...it's not Kobe beef, it's just beef, but good beef, cooked correctly! Carin had the Roasted Chicken which was also really well prepared...crispy skin, moist and flavorful! We couldn't begin to eat it all, so DeeDee was delighted with us when we got home:)For the capper, they have started making their own pies, in their wood fired oven. You know what's better than chocolate pecan pie in homemade crust (yeah baby, none of the store bought crap for these Roaring Forkers)...almost nothing! Sex, that's about it.Jeez, I waddled out of there, $50 lighter, but that's a hell of a meal for $50, (including a couple of single malts, a marti and dessert)!So, how does a fork roar? It roars for thee my friend, it roars for thee.I came here for happy hour and left a happy camper. Everything on the menu sounded great and we finally decided on the queso con carnitas and the big ass burger. The appetizer was very flavorful the only thing I didn't like is that there was more meat than queso so it was kind of hard to eat. The big ass burger was the best burger I have ever had. It came with chipotle mayo that wasn't very flavorful but the burger didn't need anything added on to it. The meat was amazing and melted in your mouth. I ate half of the burger and was full for the rest of the night.I like green chile. I like mac and cheese. So, clearly I'm ordering green chile mac and cheese. And luckily I'm enjoying it immensely thanks to Roaring Fork. Other foods I tried included the white bean soup (made with a pork base which made it pretty much delicious) and shrimp and grits. Were these any old grits you ask? Funny you ask because no is the answer. They were corn grits, which sounds odd and is mighty tasty.The atmosphere here is warm and cabin-y. It seems like a great place to scoot in close to your date and get involved in a romantic dinner. Equally, I saw a few ladies groups there toasting each other with glasses of wine and sharing appetizers. It's one of those places that most groups don't feel out of place in.Overall, I'd say this is a bit of an upscale place, but not so fancy that you have to save it for special occasions. Unless, you're like me and treat everyday like a special occasion. ;-)When I got here what was roaring was my stomach! It had been a long day and after unwinding a tad at the Fairmont we headed here for a special birfday dinner. We hung out in the bar area while waiting for our table. Immediate service... woot. woot. What? Table ready early? woot. woot. woot. Drinks were brought to our table and we examined the menu. I was having a difficult time deciding on what to get until I saw the RF Mixed Grill... Baby Back Ribs, Bacon wrapped Quail and Prawns. Roasted Corn side with a dollop of mashed potatoes.. look no further I am sold. The prawns were slightly over cooked but that did not bother me as the quail was friggin awesome. I am noticing a bacon theme here in Scottsdale and I endorse it 125%. The boyfriend got the teriyaki cedar plank salmon which was inhaled in seconds. The lamb shank is ridiculously huge... it looks like a turkey leg on steroids. I had a bite and it was also well cooked (not super gamy in taste). The grilled asparagus side is huge and can easily be shared between 2-3 people. Dessert... Creme Brulee how I love you so.... the birfday girl got a Mexican Vanilla Creme Brulee and it was perfect... the custard was sweet but not too sweet and the brulee was a wonderful golden brown thin layer of crispy sugar goodness. Extensive wine list, classic and infusion mixed drinks. I suggest making reservations.. this place is consistently packed.The Fork That Roared.For some reason, maybe due to the name, I thought this restaurant would be just a step above a Chili's or a TGIF--that is to say, a chain restaurant. I should have known better, however, since Lynn W. selected RF for her birthday dinner--and she has excellent taste.The basket of assorted breads was a fantastic way to start the meal. And the seared scallop appetizer was worthy of a good old-fashioned plate licking--but I abstained. When my pork tenderloin arrived my stomach jumped in anticipation. The tenderloin stretched the breadth of my plate, anchored by a dollop of cheesy grits, and topped with grilled corn and a wonderful sweetly tart sauce. The pork was very tender and cooked until it was rosy in the middle, as I had requested. I never order pork in restaurants because I'm always afraid it will be dry. But after eating each delicious bite of this tenderloin, I will certainly start ordering more pork.I skipped dessert because I was so full. Instead I sat and marveled at how good the food is at Roaring Fork and took in my surroundings. The ambiance confused me a little, I'll admit, as I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant or something more casual. Regardless, everything I ate was delicious, and everyone in our party agreed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will happily eat here again.Plus there's the bonus of being able to play with the branding iron in front of the rotisserie in the entryway when it's late and nobody's watching. ;)Rawr.If you're a meat and potatoes sort of person like I am, The Roaring Fork will do you just fine. While I'm sure this is the trendiest of eateries in town (I was the youngest person at happy hour by about 10 years!), the Old West spirit of simple, wood-fired grub is both timeless and ageless. Named after a river in Colorado, thing big and gutsy, and that translates to fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs (smothered in a Dr. Pepper bbq sauce, no less), green chile mac 'n cheese, and smashed potatoes. The food here is meant to satiate and stuff, in all the right ways. My only regret was not trying their infamous "Big Ass Burger" but that just leaves room for another visit one day.P.S. If you can handle it, figure out a way to try their Pineapple Cornmeal Upside Down Cake; I'm not sure if it really embodies the Southwest or anything, but it sure tastes good!I love the cozy feel of Roaring Fork, but what's even better than the atmosphere is their incredible happy hour menu. I think they have one of the best happy hours in town, especially when they start their all-night happy hour during the summer months! That's right, I said all night happy hour! Their happy hour menu includes their signatures items including the pork stew, fish tacos and the Big Ass burger...and yes friends, it's truly a Big Ass Burger! Keep an eye on their updates because a little birdie told me that the all night happy hour is coming to town very soon!I just need to start out by saying... BEST HAPPY HOUR ever! Especially in the winter, it is just so cozy! The Big A$$ burger is $10 and absolutely incredible. I DO encourage you to share it because it is MASSIVE (hence the name). I am also a huge fan of their guacamole ($7) and wedge salad ($6). Cocktails and wine are $5 and I highly recommend getting the huckleberry frozen margarita. Two of them will send you off smiling from ear to ear. :) Roaring Fork is one of the best places in town when you're comparing quality, quantity & price! Enjoy!
Aloha Specialties=Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love Vegas.Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love staying at the Cal Hotel when they go to Vegas.Hawaiians, for whatever reason, will spend their last waking moments in Vegas... literally an hour before they take the early evening flight on Hawaiian Airlines back to the islands... eating local Hawaiian food at Aloha Specialties at the Cal Hotel!At least this was what was going on when I was here the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We waited in that long-ass line close to HALF AN HOUR. I struck up a conversation with the woman behind me about how the tap water in Vegas tastes terrible. (For those of you who aren't aware, the tap water in Hawaii is magically delicious.)Alright, now for the actual review. This place is like a Zippy's with a much longer wait but a much smaller menu. However, for a mainland Hawaiian restaurant, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. My dad and I both ordered the fried saimin (which to my dismay was mediocre... should have gone for the $4.95 large regular saimin!). My mom got some special Japanese lunch box (which I forget the name of), and my sister ordered the Korean-style beef and chicken plate lunch combo, which was really good. The mac salad hit the spot too.There are a number of Hawaiian places around Vegas, but my guess is that this is the place to go if you wanna feel that real spirit of Aloha. Maybe that's just because it's full of Hawaiians in an extra good mood because they're grindin on yummy authentic local food. Just be prepared to WAIT.Took a spam musubi ($1.50) to go, and ate it while I waited for my flight back to SF. I bet I got a bunch of weird looks by those unaware of the power of something resembling a oversized, angular sushi roll... but I don't care!My coworkers always tell me the best place to get Hawaiian Food in Vegas is at the California Hotel (http://www.thecal.com/) at a restaurant called Aloha Specialties. (http://www.thecal.com/display.cfm?id=1075) About 80% of the Hawaiians that come to Vegas make a pilgrimage to this hotel. Interesting... Anyways, Aloha Specialties is decent size that can seat about 100 people or so. Surprisingly they need it cuz the line is always out the door. We waited about 15 minutes to put our order in and then another 10 minutes for them to bring it out to our table. The food is amazing and the dishes are about $7 each. They have a huge selection and since we couldnt order the whole menu, we decided on: The Beef Stew, Korean Beef and Korean Chicken, and the Special Mix Plate. I would definitely come eat here again.I like the fact that if I'm buzzed playin' blackjack, or buzzed getting mugged by the one armed bandit Wheel of Fortune slot machine (which I now call the Wheel of Doom), and a Spam Musubi craving hits, I can pop upstairs, get it handled, and then get back to the debauchery.  Also, a nice hot steamy bowl of Saimin goes a long way after those nights out drinking until 6am...Woohoo! As good as it gets! (but only in vegas)If this restaurant were in a town called Honolulu, It would warrant  3.5 stars but while living in Las Vegas for 5 years, Aloha Specialties is 5 stars, Woohoo! As good as it gets! A taste of home away from home.You may not win at the slots downstairs at the Cal but an escalator ride up to the second floor,  you'll be a Winner with Dinner! (lunch and breakfast too)Do as I do, order the Hamburger steak with mac salad, rice.  A side order of Mahi w/ extra tartar sauce. A small saimin, spam musubi to go and a passion orange juice.On a typical day, I'm a polite girl, BUT, Big BUT, when it comes to local food, and I'm in a starvation mode, Or if I'm losing big on the tables, I'll push, shove, gauge your eyes out, to get my hands on my favorite local grub. I'll even snake your table, call in my food order on the phone instead of waiting in that long line.  I'll get my food quicker than you, one way or another.   SUCKA!Where's the Aloha, Love? Sorry, left it at home.I'm a particularly strange gal.For me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a meal stop at the California Hotel.  Specifically, no trip to Vegas is complete without my Hawaiian food fix.This trip was no different.  Sure, I could have had the Loco Moco downstairs at Market Street, but... I was in the mood for full-on Hawaiian.Large saimin with veggies and wontons?  Check.Loco Moco plate?  Check.Spam musubis?  Check.Ahhh.  Talk about an awesome lunch.I don't understand why people would shell out tons of dough on whatevers food at the Strip when Aloha Specialties is just a five minute drive away.Save yourself a bundle and check out this joint.  It's ghetto, but definitely hits the spot.Then you can go to Lappert's for ice cream afterwards!Yippee!!My family from Hawaii always stay at the California Hotel when they come out to Vegas 2 or 3 times a year.  Although they are here frequently, it has been a couple of years since we've eaten at this restaurant.  I was in the mood for some Saimin so we headed down to meet them here for lunch.I ordered a small bowl of Saimin ($5.99) and a Teri-Burger ($6.99).  Their definition of "small" is Hawaiian Small.....which means H-U-G-E!  The bowl of Saimin was about a 1/2 gallon.  It was tasty as usual.  The Teri-Burger was very good too.....it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad....but I didn't try it, I was too stuffed.A couple of tips if you are going to visit this place:- It gets very crowded during Lunch and Dinner hours, so it's best to go between those meal periods.- It's a self service restaurant where you order at the counter and they either call your number or take it to your table.- You can order take out.- There is fresh iced water in jugs on the right side of the restaurant.....I didn't see this and ordered bottled Water.Overall, it was another good meal at Aloha Specialties....I got my Saimin fix for a while.Will I return?  You bet I will.it's alright. decent price, no wait. and service is fast. i only had a spam musubi for $2. it helped ease my growling stomach. I had a few bites of the kalua pork -- it was okay.. i wish the cabbage and the pork were more shredded. And it was too watery. I like it a bit more dry. The rice that came with was not hot and was not soft either. It tasted like day old rice. -- no bueno.on another note this place definitely satisfies your hungry stomach.After a 10 hour drive from SF to Vegas, we were anxious to fill our growling tummies. After hearing about the best Hawaiian food at the California Hotel and seeing the pictures of delicious poke on Yelp, we were sold. We didn't have to return our rental car for a few hours, so we quickly drove 20 minutes off the strip to Aloha Specialties Restaurant. What a disappointment! First of all, we were told that they haven't served poke in about a year. Talk about false advertisement! If you're looking to order poke, look elsewhere. They don't have it here. Fine, everything else on the menu looked appetizing enough that we could probably still be satisfied sans poke right? Wrong! When we got our meals, no one left satisfied. I wouldn't suggest wasting gas, cab money or calories here at all.3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars!  Aloha Specialties Restaurant is the popular one-stop shop for local Hawaiian food when you visit Las Vegas.  The restaurant is located in the California Hotel and Casino.  You need to time your visit here (i.e., go early) because this place gets crowded!  I always wondered why Hawaii people would rush to a Hawaii restaurant in Las Vegas.  Don't we get enough local food at home?  It's all about comfort food.Prices are reasonable, but the food preparation can take a while.  Be sure you have some good topics to talk with your table mates about.  Employees here work super hard to ensure you have a good experience.Large Saimin Noodles:  This dish was just like eating local noodles at home in Hawaii.  The portions are quite large.  The saimin tasted like S&S saimin.  Although the noodles were a bit too soft and smooshy for me, it reminded me of my childhood.  Nice.  Grade:  Bhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#q_r79ge6x7EL_xu82rWY5QChicken Curry & Rice:  This dish wasn't my favorite.  Period.  The flavor was right on, but the texture was a bit starchy and thick.  Not my style of local chicken curry.  Grade:  C+Pork Tofu:  This dish was like home cooking!  Slices of pork cooked with onions, tofu, and served in a mirin, shoyu, and hondashi sauce!  WINNER!  Grade:  A!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#_vF_tioidPEEiY4eFWmoCASpicy Korean BBQ Chicken:  The highlight of my dish was the grilled Korean BBQ chicken.  Three thighs were served with a whole lot of rice and a side of macaroni salad.  Well prepared, well cooked, delicious flavor.  Grade:  A-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-specialties-restaurant-las-vegas?select=0L7OXNm25KcXc31ftjIpUw#0L7OXNm25KcXc31ftjIpUwFood Grade:  BService Grade:  BWorth The Money Grade:  BOverall Impression Grade:  BLocated on the 2nd floor of the California Hotel. If it weren't for the long wait times to get your food and CASH ONLY, this place would be 5 stars in my book. The food portions are huge and decently priced. You know this place is authentic when you see an abundance of Hawaiian customers. I love the food here, but I still haven't forgiven them for making me miss my flight. The day after some qt and barhopping with the bff, he was craving Hawaiian and thought we had time to grab some lunch here before taking me to McCarran. It would've been true if we went somewhere else!!We ordered our food to-go and waited about 50 mins until we got it. The wait is ridiculous! Of course I missed my opportunity to check in on time and I had to scramble to find another flight. I had the most expensive spam musubis ever that day hahah ($180 for last minute flight to LAX).Need some Island style home cooking? Well Aloha Specialties is the place to visit for that itch. Located on the second floor of the California Hotel & Casino. I felt I was transported back to Waikiki. I arrived on a Sunday and made it a point to drive directly here after landing from  So Cal. I had a Hawaiian grub itch that needed fixing quick. After valet parking (self park $3.00) I jumped in the long line to place my order and  opted for the small saimin and Loco Moco since I couldn't decide  on what to choose. Not long after being seated the friendly waitress brought me the two entrees.  I cracked up BC she was looking for another person to give a dish to. Even the customer next to me was shocked what I was going to attempt to do. We laughed about taking leftovers for dinner. Hey at these bargain prices - how could I possibly go wrong? It's cash only so leave your plastic in your purse or wallets people.The saimin broth was yummy, chau Sui seasoned to perfect flavor - not overcooked or to sweet and just the right amount of fat. the small order was generously sized and hit the spot. The loco moco was also gigantic with a steamed rice base topped with a hamburger patty and drenched with gravy and a medium cooked egg once top . Talk about comfort food - this definitely is the place to find it. There's seating out front if you''re nto people watching while dinning and many entrees sell out as did that day. I'm looking forward to returning and sampling  additional island style favorites.This review is long overdue as I've been here more times than I can count, over the years. The California Hotel & Casino is like the capital of the 9th Hawaiian island, known as Las Vegas. If you're from Hawaii, you know this to be the truth! Take a stroll thru the casino - the odds of hitting the lottery are better than never seeing someone from Hawaii. Anyway - some locals like to go the California to eat at Aloha Specialties. Somewhat reasonable prices for decent portions. This last visit, I had a bowl of Saimin with won ton and a side of macaroni salad. The Saimin broth is ok but the noodles are a little thick and a little chewy. Won tons - too much dough. I prefer to have more meat filling. A little on the chewy side too. To clarify - not a crunchy chew but bordering under cooked pasta. Al dente.Macaroni salad - made with too much mayo. I love mayo but if you take a look at my pics, it was like instead of using one entire container of Costco size mayo, two were used. Walking in - get in line to place your order then find seating. No table service. Your order is brought out and if you want water or refills, there's a water station. I can't speak as to refills as I opted for water. I know I have posted other reviews that are critical of "Hawaiian" restaurants. This one is no exception. Having been born and raised in Hawaii - I'm not a fan of this place and I only went because family was craving one of the dishes served there.
Arizona Opry=Move over Branson, Missouri! The Barleen family has built quite the variety show mecca in Apache Junction. The Arizona Opry is a hoot! It's like a 1980s Disney variety show (no characters) crossed with Hee Haw! One of the performers looks like John Denver and sings a few covers. (There's a John Denver Tribute Show planned for February) Another dresses up like Willie Nelson. The husband is an original member of the Tokens (The Lion Sleeps Tonight) and, of course, reprises the song as a part of the show. They play about 70 different instruments throughout the night. The show takes place in a big hall off Old West Highway, filled with snowbirds and Red Hat Ladies. There's a gift shop with novelties like blinking rings and yodeling pickles and a "record store" with CDs from all of the performers. They've created quite the library over the years!! For the low, low price of $29 including tax and tip ($22 for kids age 3-12), you get all of this PLUS a cafeteria-inspired meal of roast beef or chicken (depending on the night) and chocolate cake. Lemonade and coffee are included and beer is available for $4.50/bottle. It's family fun, although, somewhat cheesy -- you've gotta give it to them - they've got talent. So, grab the kids or the old folks, and head out to the Opry. It's a kick!If you see a family of traveling mountain style performers as a child, and then at the ripe old age of 29 are instantly reminded of them when you walk into a meateriffic heart attack inducing "Feedbag" style restaurant...doesn't that say something about them as performers?  I think it does.  If you're nearby, brink yer youngins.  They're gonna love it.I had a tape that I bought of the Barleen Family for years.  I have no idea what happened to it.  SO tempted to call them up and order a CD.  Seriously.
Picnic Company Gourmet Cafe=I picked up Picnic Company today to-go.  I have been a handful of times to this location, and I'm always pleased.  The staff is friendly and the food is quality! Prices are reasonable also... you can order a full lunch for under $10!Order the almond chicken salad or make your own sandwich up (like Jared does)... you can't go wrong!  The honey mustard dressing is really good and so are the homemade croutons that come in most of the salads.  Their side items are always fresh and yummy - I like that they offer fresh fruit.  Their raspberry iced tea is refreshing too.  Big serving sizes are another picnic company plus.  I have never ordered their food to go and taken it on a picnic (as the name suggests) but now that we live so close to this location, I'm hoping we'll do that sometime soon!  Until then, I have no problem dining in or taking out from this casual eatery in my new hood!I'm not sure what's going on with you, Picnic Company, but I popped in to visit you today for lunch with Colleen and Amanda... I wanted to show you off to my out-of-town friends.  But unfortunately, you let me down!You had no fruit salad and you were out of ham.  Not only that, but I noticed your menu said no yogurt either... and the topper?  No bottled water - ok, I can deal with that.  But if you're out of bottled water and I request a large cup for water, do not charge me 50 cents for the cup.  Really?I hope I just hit you up on a bad day... I miss the Picnic Company I know and love!
Arizona Bread Company=I was sold at "fat free tuna fish." There aren't many sandwich shops that make tuna fish sandwiches with fat free mayo and yet it's so simple to do so! Luckily, Arizona Bread Company has this mastered and knows how to make a tasty tuna fish sandwich on their soft and delicious bread. Arizona Bread Company is simple in looks but their bread speaks wonders. It's freshly made, very soft and flavorful. I especially like that they have a variety of different breads to choose from. I even noticed a chili bread! The sandwiches here are good and it probably has something to do with the bread, which makes all the different in the world. The staff is friendly and fast and they have plenty of seating options inside the deli. This is a great lunch spot and one where you'll get in and out in no time...and with a good sandwich in your belly!
Orange Table=Tragically hip. Tragically mediocore service (they serve good coffee, the staff should really drink more...let's pick up the pace here people!). Tragically, not in my comfort  zone anymore. What's not so tragic is the freakin' white flannel hash. The bomb. Perfect everytime. I purposely leave some in the corners of my mouth so I can continue to snack on it as I walk to my car.I went there for breakfast and despite sitting on a park bench 100 feet away waiting for my friends I couldn't find the damn place. My fault, not the establishment's. I was greeted by someone at the door who immediately made the accusation, "Can I HELP you?" So I walked out and waited for my friends outside. The air conditioning wasn't working inside so it was a wash. They arrived and we were immediately seated. I was told to order the coffee soda, which I obeyed due to my brilliance. Brilliance because that shit is gooooooood. I didn't like it as much when I put the cream in it though. I appreciated that the server admitted to being hung over immediately upon her first visit to our table sort of warning us not to expect too much but she ended up being fine. But the same guy that accused me of needing help when I walked in also asked for our drink order in a very accusatory style. Something like you'd get at Fate. After I had been eyeing it, my veteran Orange Table companion recommended I try the jalapeno pecan pancakes and I cemented my status as the world's premier recommendation-taker because after eating about half the plate and being too full to finish, I thought about that strange, beautiful combination of flavors the rest of the day. It's a little spicy so if you hate spice don't order it. Otherwise, it's fantastic. My friend told me not to yelp this place after only one visit. She said it's such a cornucopia of experiences that this place bound to serve up in the future that I should yelp on the average rather than this one experience. But it was a good one, and I'll be back. Having owned an unsuccessful small business and having a roommate who owns a medium sized business, I can appreciate everything that it takes to make something work. Normally I'd complain about the air not working or the fucking weird dude working there who speaks in accusations but I could tell in the taste of food that this is someone's baby, which needs to be nurtured by the community and not nitpicked.I decided to try The Orange Table after finding out about the Scottsdale cafe in The Phoenix New Times "Best Of" issue. It was featured as the best neighborhood coffee shop in Scottsdale, and I decided to investigate that claim. My boyfriend and I went there for a late breakfast one Saturday morning. After a grueling search for the restaurant in Old Scottsdale, we finally found it deep into the bowels of Scottsdale Mall. Was our victorious search rewarded with a pleasant and friendly greeting from the restaurant's host? No. Were we at least greeted promptly and with an ounce of civility? Nope and nope. We stood at the entrance being ignored until we dared to ask one of the servers standing behind the register if we were to seat ourselves to which he replied something along the lines of "No, I'll seat you when I'm done awkwardly ignoring you." To all hip Phoenix-area restaurants: please stop this stupid no-host bullshit. Have someone ready to receive customers so they don't have to flag down someone to learn the rules. Eventually, Put Upon sat us and, thankfully, was not our server.  That honor went to one of the other pissed-off, unfriendly hipsters manning the joint. Thankfully, the food, for the most part, was much better than the service. I settled on some jungle pancakes, while my boyfriend went for some sort of Greek omelet. The Orange Table features an ambitious menu of inventive breakfast items and generously sized sandwiches that made for some tough choices. Although the prices are somewhat high, the entrees came in sumptuous portions. The only complaint I had about the meal itself was that, in this coffee shop, the brewed coffee we were served was lukewarm. Overall, The Orange Table has many things going for it, including an extensive, carefully crafted menu. However, from my experience there and the collective experiences of fellow Yelpers who dared to get there at the "wrong time," the service leaves much to be desired. I don't entirely blame the hipster help, as it appears that they aren't given the support they need. Someone needs to put the same care into the serving process as they did into the restaurant's ambiance and repertoire. Until then, I'll stick with restaurants that want and can handle my business.i didn't have the same lame service as everyone else. my drinks were refilled frequently, we got an awesome spot on the patio and the weather couldn't have been better. and the food, oh man!! the strawberry pancakes were amazing! we also ordered the monkey pancakes (banana, coconut, and almonds) and they were only so-so, I wouldn't order them again.Their bacon was perfectly crispy. the only bummer is they were out of coffee soda which I have been wanting to try. Oh well, next time.This place was super hard to find, it's in the actual scottsdale mall where they have all of the culture fests. we parked in the parking structure by los olivos.Today I wanted to take a dear friend to some place out of the ordinary , of the beaten path,  non-chainish  for Brunch . I had wanted to try this place for awhile but it never seemed to work out for us .  So today with no time  or kid constraints we set out .. we began our  search for thew perfect breakfast, and then we searched some more and then we backtracked and searched some more..Dang Y'all this place is hard to find. With a point in the direction from a nice landscaping type we searched some more .. aha the address.. ohh darn  it s the address for the whole building! Being the great  Easter egg hunter I am , I didn't give up, we looked high we looked low .. we found a sign , it's here ! It's where? Finally  there it was the ever elusive .. Orange Table .. not as  charming on the outside as I hoped , we still went in and decided to give it a try.  The servers were uber helpful and gracious .. they are really working on service , we had quick drinks, great explanations on food ,  we also heard from our waitress that they create all food fresh and nothing is sitting thus the longer time to wait.. hmm okay ..  she also  had apologies for waiting for a drink .. didn't notice..The apricot tea was fabulous and really hit the spot after our trek to find this little nirvana. The food on the menu all sounded great and looked amazing at the other tables .We ordered two omelets to share with sourdough toast. My gruyere and mushroom omelet had a tasty sauce that made me want to lick the plate.  My friend's Monaco omelet was tres Mediterranean  and tasted yummers too!  We both were happy with our meals and want to come back. Loved the place it would get five  stars if I could of found it easier, portions were bigger, and the breads were more interesting .. But I will be back .Another poem (although not by popular demand...it's just the voices in my head demanding attention:)I stopped for some lunch at the old Orange Table,They always have savory food,It was crowded as hell (even in summer),So the service was not very good;The wait staff is hip and they sort of act cool,By their looks, I could tell I was not,I was wearing a golf shirt and old cargo shorts,They just didn't think I was hot;They chatted with friends, and hung out in the kitchen,But they did bring my soup, hot and tasty,And a good turkey sandwich with lettuce and mayo,The bread was just right, thick and crustySo would I return to the tables of Orange?Oh sure, they are right in my 'hood,The food is just fine, all fresh and well made,But I'd have to be in a great mood:)I just had some of the best pancakes ever at Orange Table!  The jalapeno pecan pancakes are perfection!  Unfortunately, the service is far from perfection.In skimming the reviews, there seems to be a common theme with service issues; however, it seems like there are an awful lot of excuses made for the poor service.  Call me crazy, but perhaps if the staff is too hungover to work or too hip to manage a smile, the service industry is not their calling...unless they work here I guess.When we walked in, there were a couple empty tables, but no one was interested in even acknowledging us.  I finally interrupted the server at the counter to ask if we were to seat ourselves.  Without looking up all we got was "no, there's a wait."  At least another 5 minutes went by before she could be bothered to get our name.  Those who came in after us were met by other servers with the same attitude.  The server who took eventually took our name ended up waiting on us as well.  She became slightly more pleasant, but the wait for everything was ridiculous.   At the point our food arrived, we still had no utensils.  My husband had planned to get coffee before we left, but we got the check abruptly.  The only thing without a wait.So for those of you who want to hang out a couple hours for breakfast, the Orange Table may be your dream restaurant.  I would just suggest bringing your own drinks...and maybe a fork, so as to not unduly burden the servers.  I, on the other hand, will be making my own jalapeno pecan pancakes.  Thanks for the idea Orange Table!I'm pissed.  Surprised...and pissed.  What the hell happened to Orange Table!?  My boyfriend and I stopped for breakfast on Sunday and experienced the worst service I think that I have had anywhere!We ordered breakfast.  After waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), I went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  The response was, and I quote, "The kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes."  Note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.After waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  When we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and I quote: "Haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  We are always slow on the weekend."  Are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  This is an appropriate response!?  Again, no apology.  No offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  And is slow service EVER an acceptable policy!?A few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and I stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  We even said to the waiter, "We were just going to leave."  No response.  None!  Couldn't friggin' believe it.I used to tell everyone about this place.  No more.This is one of the many trendy little hot spots in the Old Town Scottsdale area. We came here for a late breakfast one fine Saturday afternoon. Luckily, maybe because it was late there wasn't a wait at all. We were able to get a nice little seat outside on the patio so we could enjoy the weather and do some good people watching. I will admit that some other reviewers are right... the service here isn't amazing. Our server seemed very rushed and distracted, but at no point in time during our meal was she bad enough to really make us take notice. At some point in time... you realize that these waitresses are more trendy than professional, so if you can enjoy your breakfast knowing that you aren't going to get the best service of your life, you'll have fun. The best way I could describe it, would be like you are getting waited on by a less mature younger sibling. They may not be doing the best job... but they mean well. If you're the type of person that demands impeccable service, this could very well be a deal breaker. The food here is fresh and flavorful... the dishes match the independent vibe of the building and staff very well. The standouts for us were the "Monkey Cakes" which were very nicely cooked pancakes with bananas and slivered almonds in the batter, very yummy! By all means, I recommend this place to 9/10 people. If you're comfortable in this yuppie type of environment you'll more than likely enjoy it. We'll probably be back some time to try more, or maybe even give their lunch/dinner menu a go.Strong coffee. Stronger Bloody Marys. A perfect hideaway to catch up with friends and while away a few hours, especially considering the extremely casual approaching to waiting tables that goes on here! Best reason to go though: Proof that hipsters, skinny jeans and Zooey Deschanel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVh8kVZ_XM) look-alikes do exist in Arizona!Well... usually I excuse poor service to a certain degree... but our last trip to the Orange Table was remarkably bad as far as service is concerned. We waited nearly 20 minutes before someone came over to our table... and as many of you know this is not a big place! Then when our waiter did come he just kind of stood there and said "wassup". For a second I thought I was going to have to spell it out for him; "Well, we just came here to eat some food, which is what we're attempting to do right now". Thank God the food is still great... so for now we're only gonna downgrade Orange Table by one star down to a three out of five. Our burger and sandwich were damn good... as was our cream soda; but the highlight of this visit without a doubt the fact that our waiter is a glorified Youtube/Reality TV star (well, not in a good way... and I guess I'm exaggerating quite a bit when I say 'star'). Anyone remember that episode of Cheaters where the goofy dude with the mullet had this uber-attractive girlfriend only to cheat on her (Not very helpful... I guess this describes a lot of episodes of Cheaters)? Anyway, the dude gets interviewed and spouts off this gem:"I do chicks man... that's just what I do". ...he then spouts off all sorts of other nonsense, trying to show that he is the man of all men, which he clearly isn't. The clip was featured on The Soup and a bunch of other shows and was cringe inducing because you wonder how a mullet sporting piece of white trash could nab the type of girl he was with... and not only that... but find more women to cheat on her with, it's only shit you could see on crappy reality TV. Anyway... that dude now waits tables at the Orange Table and was our waiter the other day. So now you know at least one reason why the service isn't exactly grade A.Breakfast or lunch, this is a place I can visit knowing I won't leave hungry. When I make a stop into Orange Table, I prepare myself for a bit of a wait, but the experience is eclectic and fun so I really don't mind. This is a restaurant where I can go and lounge and enjoy a lazy Saturday or Sunday when those types of days come around. Situated in the middle of the Civic Center, there are many times when the weather is nice and a festival is going on outside, so Orange Table makes for a perfect cuisine break before browsing the different tables at the festival. I stumbled upon Orange Table years ago and discovered that the food is pretty darn tasty when I'm hungry and needing some...umm.. thick food to help with dehydration from the night before. It's hard to decide between their breakfast and lunch but it all depends on the mood and everything on the menu is excellent. For lunch, I go for their chicken sandwich and for breakfast I normally go for the eggs, bacon and potatoes but their pancakes are excellent as well. When the weather's nice I love the outdoor patio and the indoor dining area is nice to spend some time in and relax. Be prepared for a wait if you get there too late because it's not a huge restaurant and popularity fills it up fast!After hearing Orange Table had gotten their service issues corrected, I had to judge for myself.It's TRUE!!!!!!!!  Things were a little slow in the beginning, so I was worried.  But once our server did make it to us, things were pretty good.  Food did not take nearly as long as it used to, and wait for this.......................................................................................our server was PLEASANT!  I know, like night and day.Welcome back to my life OT!7/03/13I've dined here by myself and with an aunt prior to today's meal, and I'm surprised I haven't updated my '09 review, yet.  (When I stumble onto those photos, some are dated 2012, I will have to add them with accompanying reviews- hopefully soon'ish.)Brought Mom and visiting sis and her two kids with me for breakfast and seated ourselves in Harper's section.  (We assumed he was new, since it took awhile for him to greet us hello with our menus and glasses of water that kept slipping from his grasp and landing with thuds and splashes of water on the table.  We had to ask him on his return visit to take our orders to wipe up the spills-- maybe, because of his nervousness, he forgot to wipe up the spills automatically?)  I ordered a Mocha http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=TV17TplQu-8JWzwEoCIL-Q#TV17TplQu-8JWzwEoCIL-Q and was asked for the first time (I've been here a few times in the past few months) if I preferred whole, 2%, or non-fat milk.  I assumed I was served whole milk in the past, so I decided to try one with 2%.  Sister ordered the Mexican chocolate coffee, and everyone else had water or soda.  Here is what we all ordered:Red flannel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=9aaOzFYNBxJTH_-x7ZvEtw#9aaOzFYNBxJTH_-x7ZvEtwBananas Foster French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=ILKRAvof4ebudeC9CrTojg#ILKRAvof4ebudeC9CrTojgCorned beef hash http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=HGN4WwDMfDUy-87_NZ8j5A#HGN4WwDMfDUy-87_NZ8j5AWhite flannel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=5XaxXOQptdGzuMGI2_iF1Q#5XaxXOQptdGzuMGI2_iF1QBasic buttermilk cakes (two cakes in an order, with added chocolate chips on one of them) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/orange-table-scottsdale?select=qmtVNuiojC5Mo3DgV1cs7A#qmtVNuiojC5Mo3DgV1cs7AAs I ordered the French toast and the Red flannel, Mom mentioned that she and I were going to share the French toast, and my sister placed their orders of corned beef hash (niece), buttermilk cakes (nephew, with one of the cakes with chocolate chips- extra charge, of course), and the white flannel for her.  I asked if I could change my wheat bread selection to olive, and Harper said yes, but the olive toast ended up on sister's plate.  We had to remind him of my side of bacon and sausage.  The French toast didn't have enough bananas, and I wished I remembered to ask for some bananas placed on top of the toast, as well as whatever slices come in the whiskey sauce itself, which came with subbed almonds.  The lack of bananas was a little disappointing, so I suggest to request extra bananas-- the name of the dish is Bananas Fosters, yes?  The Red flannel would've been very good, but it felt undercooked.  Definitely mushy in texture, and not as texturally-satisfying as the order of Green flannel my aunt had back in November '12-- I tried a little portion of it and liked the crisped edges!  Also, all of the flannels we ordered today looked slightly disappointing-- maybe there's a new cook?  No one ate the flannel leftovers we brought home; However, sister liked her White flannel entree...  The flannels did taste better when eaten with sour cream.The chocolate chip pancake was delicious!  Nephew isn't a big eater, so I was able to try some (thank goodness OT serves 100% pure maple syrup!), as well as some of the leftovers at home.  I'd say the highlights of breakfast that morning were the sides of Nueske's bacon and one sausage and the olive toast!  My mocha made with 2% milk wasn't popular with anyone, including me, so I'd suggest ordering it with whole milk (leftover Mocha keeps well in the fridge for at least a week!).  Sister  had to add sugar to her Mexican chocolate coffee to enjoy it.  (She tried it without sugar, the way I drink my coffee, and "it was tolerable," but definitely better with Splenda.)  Everyone enjoyed the atmosphere (and the couches!), and with a few tweaks, this could've been a four-star.  Good luck to Harper!
Makino LV=Makino is fine for what it is.  I sometimes stop by here and get a take out box and just stuff the box with stuff.  It usually comes to like $10 or so which is fine.  But I don't like the idea of the sushi just SITTING there the whole time getting dry or whatever.  The sushi buffet places that make it to order are definitely a better way to go.  Don't get me wrong though..I'll still eat these rolls if they're there.  I just think there are better choices out there for sushi buffets like Sushi Hana or even Sushi Factory.BTW...Penn from Rio's "Penn and Teller" dines here for lunch quite often.  I've seen him there at least 4 times and I don't here that often for my takeout box.  You can't miss him.I'm probably biased with Makinos since that is like my favorite AYCE sushi joint there, but man I love this place...Anytime and every time I'm in Vegas, you know you can count on me visiting one of the Makino locations for sure!For those of you who read my other Makino review (located in the heart of the LV Fashion Outlets), know that the variety of sushi at this place is just terrific!  If you were to compare Makinos to the likes of Todai, Onami, etc... I'm telling you Makino will blow it out of the water!  So this Makino branch on Decatur'Flamingo is suppose to be the original Makinos that has set foot in Vegas.  For those who don't know, Mr. Makino was (I believe) the founder of Todai... then later when the quality was not up to par or as he has intended he decided to sell the chain and create Makino in Vegas instead to keep his sushi legacy going.So let's get back on track to the sushi part of the story...  What don't you want? What can't you get?  It's got everything here!  6 different types of California rolls, 10 types of fusion rolls, 10 types of nigiri, and a few other deep fried sushi for those of you who loves anything fried... the best part about Makinos?  The menu is not set and it changes daily... so let the imagination creation run wide my sushi chefs!  (numbers are approximations but it is quite vast for sure!)I can't tell you which rolls are good but I'm a sucker for fusion sushi..  (I'm not all that into the good old traditional styles so you can definitely call me biased on that!)  So majority of them are all very tasty!  (I just skip those that has cream cheese in them because sushi don't taste right with cream cheese in my mind)  So try them all and let me know which is your favorite!  Then for those who are not keen on sushi there's a lot more you can work with!  They've got cold salad selections (about 5 kinds), assorted hot foods for you to choose from ranging from teriyaki chicken, sukiyaki beef, deep fried tofu, steam fish, miso soup, beef ribs, gyoza, fried rice, yakisoba, steam veggies, udon noodle soup, clams, mussels, tempura veggies, and my favorite of them all, the tempura shrimp!  (These shrimps are so amazing! and it would be worth it already if you just sit there and down about 50 of them!!!  LOL!)Lastly, let's not forget about the desserts!  A decent selection of baked goods are available but the one of the tastier selection is the almond jello!  So rich in almond flavor.. yum!  And of course we can't forget about the ice cream parlor!!!  Red Bean ice cream is the way to go here!  Just simply delicious if you have never tried red bean ice cream!  (They also have vanilla, chocolate, green tea, and occasionally, a couple other flavors such as strawberry or cookies n' cream)So for those of you who are sushi specialists and not really caring much about how much it would cost to have 3 tiny plates of sushi presented in front of you, this is definitely not the place for you!  However, if you are down for a good, tasty, and fresh AYCE sushi that won't break your bank, Makino's is highly recommend.  It does take a little drive out of the strip but compared to the usual buffets in Vegas, this is definitely well worth the quick sight-seeing trip!Ok, there are probably much better sushi buffets or AYCE joints around town but for the price you really can't beat Makino. Now that the Premium Outlets location closed, I decided to come to this one. It's been a while since I last visited this location and was probably way back when they first opened it. We walked in at around 12:30 PM and were immeidately seated. We noticed that the restaurant was super cramped and crowded compared to the old outlet location, mainly because the space is smaller and it looked like they crammed as many tables as they could into the small space. Our table was about 2 inches away from the table next to us and located right by the dessert area of the buffet, which meant there were constantly people squeezing by. Space aside, our meal was excellent and we left in a dazzed food coma.The buffet area includes a salad bar, sushi area with various sushi rolls, nigiri and hand rolls, a hot food area serving various appetizers (gyoza, wings, etc) and Japanese food including udon and ramen stations. Lastly there is a dessert area with various sweets, ice cream and a chocolate fountain. We were way too full at the end of our meal to really have dessert, but I can never pass up green tea ice cream and the one here is no exception. I ended up stuffing a scoop down before leaving.Overall for $17.95 + drinks ($16.95 on weekdays for lunch), you can't beat it anywhere in the valley. Just know that if you come earlier, it could be way more crowded and a line can form. By about 1 PM the crowds died down and we didn't feel as cramped moving around the buffet.Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #288 - #365We were staying at Encore and they decided to eat at Makino  AYCE dinner because it was cheaper than eating on the strip, especially at Encore. Located about 10 minutes from the strip in a mediocre area of Vegas. I don't know the price per head because I didn't pay, Woot! This isn't just any kind of buffet but a Japanese Buffet. It was just average and the sashimi didn't taste fresh at all and I'm glad I didn't try to beef because several people in our party got food poisoning! they did have a great selection of sushi rolls and most of them had a lil too much rice and less fish. I would come back to give it another try.
Waffle House=Well...we (5) stopped in around 9:30am and all the tables were taken but had only a short wait. We ordered a little of everything... from biscuits and gravy to waffles and pork chops and omelets. All were ok though portion size was considerably smaller than I remember from our last visit. Nothing really good nor bad and service was ok too hence the 3 stars. Actually I should give give my son Jeff an extra star for picking up the tab. Thanks son! :-)Whenever we're in Phoenix visiting family we stop at the Waffle House at least once. We enjoy the waffles, eggs, and bacon. A delicious way to start a day of shopping and hanging out.Laurel, our waitress, was both friendly and attentive. The waffles were just as expected . . . warm, tasty, flavorful and abundant. The hint of vanilla brings it home for me everytime. In fact, I use no topping so as not to dilute the robust waffle flavor. Scrambled eggs. Perfection. Two eggs scrambled on the grill. Not overdone. Fluffy, and delicate.Glass of orange juice. Heaven.
Tony Roma's=If there was an option to give NEGATIVE STARS I would. This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had. Here's what happened We show up to the restaurant with a party of 8. To our surprise we were sat immediately... Now we know why. We sat for about 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks. Another 20 minutes rolled by and we still didn't have service. I finally got up and approached a manager and asked if we had a waiter coming. He said "I'm sure you do" and turned around. Strike 1.Our waitress finally arrived. She said "what does everyone want to order" she took our orders and walked away. We didn't see her until she brought put food out 45 minutes later. Completely out of water she never attempted to refill. Strike 2We ordered the 11.99 steak & lobster special, chicken fingers & fries, bacon Mac & cheese, and the rib sampler. My fries were actually as cold as the ranch. The best thing that was ordered was the Mac & Cheese. The steak & lobster were so rubbery it was unbearable to eat. Now we weren't expecting much for this price but I didn't know steak could possibly have this type of consistency. Strike 3We were never asked how the food was, our waters & beers were never refilled &  even after seeing the majority of food still on all the plates our waitress never thought to ask if everything was ok. I'm not sure if they just thought we were tourists but we are actually locals and all in the service industry. And to top it off the gratuity was already added... Insanity. When we were leaving I expressed my disappointment to the manager & all he did was smile & say "have a nice night" And to top it off after expressing these feelings a few of the servers were laughing & highfived . I will have a nice night because I now have the knowledge to never return. PS I am a bartender downtown & will tell everyone I know to keep far as possible from this establishment.We came here with low expectations, after all we were here for the 4p-6:30p, $8.99 prime rib dinner special.  Located inside the Fremont Casino on Fremont Street of Las Vegas you can't not see the huge pictures boasting the $8.99 Prime Rib Special.  After 9pm you can get a $12.99 Steak and Lobster special, but that was way too late for our hungry tummies.There was a small line at Tony Roma's and the hostess passed out paper ticket numbers instead of the traditional write your name on list.  Much to our surprise the hostess rattled off numbers faster than a machine gun, often calling 6 parties at once.  For a split second I thought what is this, are we all going to sit at a cafeteria style bench?  I guess TR's gets about 1000 customers a night so they are really set up be fast and efficient.  We were seated quickly in a nice booth.  Again much to our surprise our waitress was fast and friendly as well.  Furthermore the helpers clearing tables, getting drink refills and bringing out food were all fast and friendly something I really didn't expect on a blue light special meal.Of course we ordered the prime rib which came with steamed veggies and a small baked potato.  The portions were good sized and tasty.  The night before we ate at Lawry's House of Prime Rib and although TR's prime rib is not comparable it was still moist, tender and flavorful. Although I wouldn't recommend Tony Roma's for any special occasions if you want a great deal on Prime Rib this is the spot to go.This Tony Roma's is located inside a Vegas casino and is nothing like any of the other Tony Roma's restaurants I have been to.All of the other Tony Roma's exude a certain level of classiness and have a few regular items on the menu that I always look forward to ordering.I feel that all Tony Roma's chains should live up to their usual standards, but this one falls far below. Where do I start?Firstly, the reason I decided to eat here in the first place was because of all the signs outside luring you in with a picture of juicy prime rib, accompanied by a big baked potato and veggies that says "Only $8.99!"After you walk through the rowdy smoke-filled casino to get to the restaurant, you are greeted by nobody. Rather, you have to walk up to an angry lady standing at a podium and let her know that you would like to be seated. She asks your name without looking at you, and writes it down as she rudely says "30 to 40 minute wait. No prime rib tonight."Are they kidding me? How is a place like this so packed? They don't offer the meal they so widely advertise and the service is already this crappy before even getting seated!I was very tempted to leave and eat elsewhere, but me and bae were hungry and didn't feel like going on the hunt for another restaurant.   We stood up until a seat cleared so we could sit down and wait. As we waited, we had to hear the lady at the podium scream names out as tables opened up. Why can't they invest in a microphone and speaker?Once we were seated, I decided to put the experience thus far behind me and order some of that yummy Tony Roma's food.I really look forward to the warm bread and savory garlic butter served at every Tony Roma's before your food comes. What a surprise, they do not carry the garlic butter. They don't even serve bread unless you request it. I did, but it never came.At least the entrée was good. We shared the Roma Rack of ribs, baked potato soup, and a fudge cookie ice cream dessert. During dinner, we had the privilege of witnessing a woman choke on her meat and a man perform the Heimlich Maneuver on her about 10 feet from our table. Thank God it worked and she was okay.My boyfriend drank a soda with his meal and I had a glass of water with lemon. It tasted like the most disgusting grade of tap water I ever drank. I hope they also invest in a Britta filter or something.Very classy joint, huh? This place almost has no right going under the name Tony Roma's unless they adjust their standards accordingly. I will never make the mistake of coming to this particular Tony Roma's ever again.This one is located inside the Fremont Hotel/Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. This place is always packed on the weekends expect to wait at least a min of 40 mins service is ok note the steak and lobster special is served at 9pm so if you come before that you won't be able to order it. If you're in the Downtown LV area this is one of the better places to eat other than the buffets or hotel restaurants.
Kwan's Sampan=This is your grandpa's Chinese restaurant.  Don't take that the wrong way.  It's just that the decor feels to me like it is out of the 60's or 70's.  Like maybe the restaurant could have been used as a set in the movie Dirty Dancing.  You know, when Baby and her Beau sneak off to town for some chow mien.The food varied, overall it was decent, not great.  The prices were reasonable and the service was kind of slow.We had crab puffs and an egg roll for starters.  They fall at about 2.00 stars.  The entrees we had:  lobster with black bean sauce, emperor's beef, Chinese fried chicken and pork fried rice.  The lobster meat was tender.  I didn't care for the sauce.   It looked and tasted like egg drop soup with some black beans stirred in.  1.5 stars.  The beef was in a mild brown sauce over assorted vegetables.  It was tasty but needed heat to set it off.  2.5 stars.  I did not like the Chinese fried chicken as it was overdone and tasted strongly of the frying oil.  2 stars.  You should know that my wife did like it despite pointing out that it was a little chewy.  The pork fried rice was very good, with BBQ pork in good quantity.  3.75 stars.  Take the 5 ratings listed above, total them up, divide by five and you have the true rating: 2.35 stars.  Just below average.
El Gaucho Lucas Cafe=Luca's is a really odd space. It's a restaurant housed in an old church. In fact, this church (according to our server) was the very first church in Vegas ever. I believe it too based on the size, shape, and design of the interior.Luca's serves up breakfast and Italian which is another oddity about the place because those two things in combination seems like a strange choice, but there you have it. They only serve breakfast until 10:30 so if you get there after that you've got to go with lunch options.They do offer a really cheap salad and pizza buffet, but I would say the choice and quality of this buffet do match the price tag. After all, you're going to get what you pay for. After looking this over I decided to go with an Italian sandwich that I really enjoyed. It was basically mozzarella and Italian meat with a tapenade spread on a delicious bread.The prices are pretty low and the service was nice so I would possibly be up for trying it again if I lived in the area. However, it wasn't so remarkable that I'd make a conscious effort to go again just on a return visit to Vegas.
Rio Mirage Cafe Y Cantina=While I don't think there is a river or a mirage anywhere near this place, there does always seem to a large puddle of water in the parking lot. At least I think there is, unless, it's a mirage. Hmmm...What isn't a mirage is a restaurant full of local Latino families and a sea of blue haired, varicose veined, AARP folks from Sun City. I should know. Cuz my Sun City living mom and dad love Rio Mirage. This is where me and mom let loose and bond over a couple margs. While dad sips his ice tea and flirts with the waitress. I've had good luck ordering the same thing here. Carne Asada with beans and tortillas. I kinda put the steak in the tortilla, roll it up with some fixins. Chew. Smile. Chug more margarita. Mom loves the grilled quesadilla and dad's finicky ordering style is accommodated with "ground beef tacos. Hard. Nothing fancy." We always get great service and I love the local vibe. And the margarita buzz gets me through an entire game of bridge with Big Daddy and Momma Jo!
Lighthouse Sports Bar=Wow. Yeah, this isn't really my place. Lots of karaoke. Lots of weirdness. Not so bueno. I was in the bathroom and overheard two women discuss loudly the fact that their boyfriends had very specific physical problems which I would have preferred never having to overhear. The bartenders are nice, the regulars not so much. No Bombay Sapphire and the bartenders didn't even notice they had a Bombay dry gin getting dusty in the corner when I requested the Sapphire version.  I admit, I got out of here in a hurry. Probably won't be coming back.
Pepin=It's all about the package. 3.5 stars.At the restaurant Pepin, of course.  I would not give them 4 stars based solely on the food.  3 stars for the food.  It was for the most part very good but not good enough to merit  say $37 bucks that I spent on a seafood stew over noodles that my daughter and I shared.  By the way, first time I've eaten octopus, is it supposed to be textured like steak on the inside, soft on the outside and a little slippery on the surface?  But I digress.The food was overpriced for the quality.  But when you throw in Flamenco dancing, live Spanish guitar, free dancing lessons and getting pictures of my kids on stage dancing flamenco, much more worth it.The sangria was nice as well.  We shared a pitcher.  Well, the kids didn't actually have any .  Did you know Sangria helps you dance?11/3Another happy hour Tuesday for me!  Today I wanted to try AZ 88 after all these years of intention.  On my way to AZ 88, I paused for a few moments to check out Pepin's menu.  (Couldn't help it- Pepin and AZ 88 sit adjacent to each other!)  While my mouth watered at the descriptions of tapas, I, almost reluctantly, continued on my way to original destination.  Wow!  AZ 88 was DEAD.  Awashed in white tables and chairs, with only about 6 employees and me indoors, this space was too sterile for me to occupy for too long.  Even if happy hour was offered (I asked- it isn't), I don't think I would've bothered.  Impersonal and unwelcoming were adjectives that came to mind.  I will have to come back at a later time in the day to see if a higher body count and more mood lighting help to warm me up to AZ 88.Back to Pepin!  Happy hour here meant 50% off all tapas and sangrias!  Ole!  HH also means one eats at the bar counter.  Not so ole!  Pepin definitely needs to spruce this area up!  I almost gave up on the idea, but I was hungry and the $15 three-cold tapas sampler had me intrigued.  Si!  That's $7.50 to try three different cold plates; I selected roasted red peppers and goat cheese, lamb w/ garlic and sun-dried tomatoes, and cured salmon w/ fresh onions and capers, on a bed of lettuce and drizzled w/ Spanish olive oil.  I was able to secure a glass of Rene Barbieri red for 50% off (orig. $6).  Muchas gracias!!  Before my cold tapas arrived, a basket of 4 fresh-from-the-oven dinner rolls appeared, w/ a delicious aioli to accompany them!  They were so wonderful, I decided I was going to take some home w/ me :)  Xavier, my Catalan server, even gave me fresh rolls (not yet warmed in the oven) to ensure that the finished product wouldn't be rock-hard and damage my ivories.  Aw, how considerate of Xavier!  (Good thing this Catalan was married... I quite favor the Spaniards.)  Back to the tapas!  After the delightfully crispy-crusty dinner rolls, I found the slice of bread that came with the red peppers and goat cheese dull.  Thick-cut and soggy.  So, I swiped off the goat cheese and slathered it on the dinner rolls, instead!  A potential disaster averted!  Ole!  The slices of lamb were also very tasty, w/ the sun-dried tomato pieces lending a chewy texture that isn't as bad as you might think.  My favorite of the three was the cured salmon w/ capers!  With a twist of lemon, this app was simply perfect!  Yes, I'd recommend this dish to anyone.  Anyone, that is, that doesn't find fish repulsive...Hasta la vista, Pepin!  I'll be back soon to try the calamari!Terrible.I brought my boyfriend here a while ago for a romantic date out.  I thought it would be great because they had vegetarian paella for me and plenty of fish and meat for him to try.  (He doesn't normally get to do that too much since we go to mostly vegetarian places).We got an appetizer, two entrees, and some sangria, and even with a $25 gift card, the bill was still over $90 with tip.  Now, this would not have been an issue had the food been worth that.  However, the food was terrible.  It was stuck in the 80's.  The beau's chicken looked like something you would get on an airplane, and my paella could have been shown up by something in a box... mushy rice with frozen veg.  The server also charged us for 2 salads that she just brought out.  I don't mind paying for a salad, but at least ask me!At one point in our meal, my man got up and went to the restroom.  When he returned, he told me that I HAD to go look at it.  It was awful.  It was worse than any drive bars I have been to.  The paint was falling off the walls, one of the stalls didn't have a door and the other barely locked, the toilets were filthy, and the sink was disgusting.  If you charge $20-$40 a plate, you need to have the ambiance to back it up.Never go here.I bought a Groupon dinner for two as a Christmas gift for my mother.  Bad move!  Mom was upset enough to write her own bad review of the restaurant.  (I didn't even know she had a Yelp account!)The deal sounds great... $49 for a dinner for two, valued at up to $104. This includes two entrees, a pitcher of sangria, and an appetizer.  ("This must be some fancy restaurant," I thought. "What a nice gift for my Mom!")Well, she ended up not taking her boyfriend, but instead took her sister and sister's husband.  Therefore, instead of two, there were three at the table. Unfortunately, Pepin could not handle this change gracefully, and when placing the order everybody became confused with the Groupon deal.I wish they just told my mother... "Your order for three is going to exceed the value of this coupon, which is for a dinner for two. The coupon is for any two dinners, one appetizer, and one pitcher of sangria.  Since you're ordering more, we'll give you the maximum credit for your coupon, which is worth up to $104." That would have been simple.Instead, they made billing seem complicated, causing the customer to have to think too much about the bill. They didn't give the full value of the Groupon and they added a mandatory 20% gratuity on the bill (for three people).Looking back at the deal... They gave her most of the value of the coupon. The meal cost a lot more than she calculated partially because she didn't calculate the value of each item they ordered, partially because the mandatory 20% gratuity was a large, unexpected change, and partially because the prices are over-inflated ($32 for a pitcher of sangria?).I paid $49 for the deal, and Mom paid $86 in excess. For a total of $135 (supposedly 50% off), my Mom and her two guests received one entree each. They shared a single appetizer, a single dessert, and a single pitcher of sangria.  That's pretty spendy, and for that much money, you'd think everyone would leave feeling satisfied with the experience of the food and the service.  Instead, my Mom thought it was a rip off, and I'm left regretting my purchase.
Caffe Boa=Caffe Boa is a hidden gem on Mill Avenue, for both eating, drinking and relaxing with friends. It's a little bit on the pricey side though, so take advantage of the happy hour and half-priced sangria Sundays.It used to be a tiny, homey little cafe next to Long Wong's at 7th Street and Mill and has since been converted into a spacious, classy winery and Italian bistro at 4th Street and Mill.Happy hour specials are only extended to the bar area, which is tiny in comparison to the rest of the area. There's the traditional happy hour from 5 to 7, and a reverse happy hour that begins after 10 pm. (Check which days this is available though, because I'm not sure it's daily.) Draft beers like Guiness and Harp are two bucks, wine by the glass is half off (3 to 6 bucks after the discount), as are their fancy pants cocktails (generally 5 bucks)--the espresso martini is decadent--and all appetizers aside from the huge cheese plate are half priced. One wonky thing about the tab for happy hour is that they take the discount off at the end, so just keep a running tab in your head of how much you owe if you're with a group to make things go a little smoother.I'm in lust with the Shrimp Adriatico, which is an appetizer that has five big tiger shrimp swimming in garlic tomato sauce that's served with a loaf of bread for dipping. It's filling enough to serve as an entire meal, or to share among friends.On Sundays, pitchers of sangria are half priced ($15 instead of $30) and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. I prefer the white wine over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced apples and muddled citrus. Make sure to ask them to go easy on the cinnamon though, or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.Dinner is always divine as well, but a little bit on the pricey side. The meals are huge though, so you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers or you can split an entre with another person for an extra 3 buck charge. The Voodoo Penne is a delicious Cajun flavored dish, Lucas' Meatballs are savory and filling, and the Pola Pola is some awesome artichoke ravioli. Everything is done well and I rarely encounter problems with the servers or bartenders.It's a nice, mellow break from the hubbub of Mill Avenue.***UPDATE***I've been a little peeved lately at the happy hour, since it's only extended to the bar and the bar is so damn tiny. Now I understand that if I don't get there around 5 I have no chance of getting a seat. That's fine. But the damn Chase employees get there around 4:30 (before Happy Hour even starts, where's the logic in that?) and hog all the damn seats, leaving me with nothing but shattered hope and an empty glass. You better shape up, Caffe Boa, or I'm docking a star!***UPDATE***You've been docked a star Boa. You went and increased the prices of your entrees by three bucks at the very least. Fuck you and your scrumtious, mouth watering 19 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. They're fucking meatballs, Boa! Plus your half price on glasses of wine less than 10 bucks is a pretty useless deal now. Jeezy creezy.This isn't goodbye though. I'll still chill with you on Sundays for the sangria, but I shall never indulge in the pola pola, voodoo penne or your shitty Willow Bakery bread again. Bastards.I enjoyed Caffe Boa.  Really, I did.  I just think it has an identity crisis going on.  Is this Mill or is this Scottsdale?  Why does an Italian restaurant only have one pinot grigio and why is it from Argentina?  Who living next to ASU, other than professors, can pay $100 per person for a special dinner event? (And even if you could, why here?) What's with the hipster bartenders in the Italian wine bar?All that being said the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.  We went for happy hour before heading off to a friend's party and followed Erica's advice.  Sit at the bar, get there by 4:30.  Done and done.  (Btw, their happy hour now runs from 4-7)  The tap beers are $2 (and we're talking Guinness, Harp, Stella...), and half off apps (except for the cheese plate) and glasses of wine under $10 ( of course the one wine I wanted was $10.25.  Grrrr.)  The bartenders are really serious about making good drinks, I started with a watermelon martini and watched the bartender muddle the watermelon.  It was fantastic.  They had a ton of fresh fruit to muddle with behind the bar.  The only part of the night I didn't enjoy drink-wise was when one of the bartenders poured me half of a glass of champagne.  Also on Erica's recommendation we ordered the shrimp and the antipasto, both were fantastic.  But I couldn't believe there was literally only two slices of each meat, cheese, and veggie, it definitely would not have been worth it for full price.  But the olives, prosciutto and salami were all great.  My husband is not usually a prosciutto fan (whereas I could eat a pound of it in 10 minutes if you let me) but he liked theirs because it was well cured and sliced thick.  After our 2 apps, 2 glasses of wine, 3 martinis, 2 black and tans, and a glass of champagne we were ready to head out.  What was the charge for this feast? $46.  Yes, indeed, I will definitely be at this happy hour again.  Or on a Sunday when pitchers of sangria are half off - only $15 instead of $30.Update:I have come to the conclusion that Caffe Boa has the best happy hour ever.  It is a grad student's dream come true.  Amazing drink and app specials in place where your feet don't stick to the floor?  Yes please.  All of my visits here have ended with me laughing at the final bill.  4 glasses of cava for $14?   I do not think I would ever come here outside of happy hour though.  None of the appetizers are large enough to warrant their full price and that doesn't bode well for the entrees.Oh and I'm happy to report that they now have a pinot grigio from Italy.  Its quite good. :)Caffe Boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day.The service is so bad it makes the Terminal 4 baggage claim at Sky Harbor look like its staffed by nothing but Jackie Chan clones.  Thats means Boa is slooooooow, folks.I'm befuddled by the mystery of their menu, trying to discern if what beautiful items I appeared to order are actually what's in front of me.  Ogerp Pasta?  Oh, yeah, i get it.  Its Prego cleverly spelled backwards.  Next on the list Etnom Led Asparagus (apparently, some region in Tuscany).People are always up on their shit about their happy hour, which I makes my eyes roll right out of my head, because:1)  Their bar is about as big as a Subaru Vivio.2)  Their specials ONLY apply when sitting in the Vivio.3)  There are certainly no helpful chauffeurs.  Fortunately for me, its pretty far out of the way, which makes it almost certain that I can have some excuse for not driving all the way to Tempe to be spared to death.I remember when Cafe Boa was affordable. The agnolotti boa was $12.95, half that for their panini's.. Imagine my shock to learn my favorite dish is now $17.95.. For mushroom filled pasta.. Really? They do have a great wine list but it too is on the high price sides and their tasting are a pretentious $100 cover - get real.My last experience deserves 1 * but I give 2 *s because the food is still great. I went alone and sat at a table for about 15 minutes before I could get eye contact, let alone a glass of water.  My meal and a glass of wine was an outrageous $34 - FOR LUNCH! Don't get me wrong the food is good, but the service generally sucks. I recommend going on Sundays when apps and sangria are half off. There are just too many great, authentic places to go to put up with the price and lack of creativity in their dishes.Kristin S has always raved about this place as being an amazing happy hour spot, so my husband and I met her, as well as Melissa H and her husband, there for some discounted appetizers and drinks. Since Kristin had mentioned that the bar fills up really quickly during happy hour (which happens everyday from 4 - 7 pm), those of us who could arrive around 4:30 did. It didn't end up being that crowded after all, but given that the only bar-area seating consists of seats at the smallish bar and a few high tables, I would still recommend arriving as early as you can so that you don't end up missing the great happy hour deals. All of us ended up finding a drink deal that fit our mood at the moment: Melissa and her husband got some draft beer for only $2, Kristin took advantage of the wine specials (50% of wine by the glass), and my husband and I each sampled two signature cocktails that were discounted from $12 to $8. The Prosciutto e Melone and XXX martinis were good but not spectacular, but we both thought that the Anastasia (vodka, basil, and muddled strawberries) and the Blueberry Lemon Drop (with fresh blueberries) were distinctive and delicious. Next time, we'll probably have wine and beer, though, so we can really experience how cheap Caffe Boa's happy hour can be!In terms of food, the following appetizers are 50% off during happy hour: bruschetta, antipasto platter, Shrimp Adriatico, and Capriatta (essentially a Caprese salad). Since all of these appetizers (except for the antipasto platter, which is normally $15) are usually $6 - $10, you can truly eat well for cheap! We tried all of these four apps except for the Capriatta. I especially enjoyed the Shrimp Adriatico's spicy and savory tomato-based sauce (excellent to dip bread in!) and the antipasto platter was presented well and featured some high-quality meats, cheeses, and vegetables. As everyone has already said, Caffe Boa's happy hour offers discounted and good drinks and appetizers in an non-Mill Avenue environment. I doubt I'll return for dinner, but I will definitely stop by the bar area between 4 and 7 at some point soon!Remember when Caffe Boa was right on Mill, next to Red Lantern and Long Wong's? Remember when they were doing inventive, handmade pastas with fresh sauces and always had great specials? Remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail? REMEMBER THE AGNOLOTTI?? There was nothing like it in Tempe at the time.Yeah, it ain't that anymore. Every red sauce tastes like Ketchup and melted margarine. Every food object tastes like Sysco. I swear there are still ice crystals in the shrimp. It's now a place for college kids to play grown-up date night, and former fans to hang their heads in sadness. I guess it serves its purpose as more of a college bar/practice restaurant. And its crowd is pleased with its easily-digested mediocrity. But I still lament the passing of the original, inspired Boa.RIP Boa.Now that I no longer live alone, I try to embrace any me time I can find, therefore eating alone is one of my very favorite things to do. Even though sitting solo makes people look at you like you have 23 heads and/or brings sympathetic half assed smiles, I truly love it. The other day, while walking down Mill (after a very successful interview), I stumbled upon Cafe Boa.. all I can say is fn fyeah!It is a lot "fancier" than I had expected. My goal for the afternoon was to find a delicious salad and a glass of good wine. Not only did I find that here (I had the butter cup lettuce with grilled chicken breast, sliced almonds, avocado, heirloom tomato & sunflower sprouts topped with champagne/lemon vinaigrette), but I also found delicious bread served with hummus, olive oil from Queen Creek, the best Calamata olives I've ever eaten (to start) AND the most delicious Pomegranate iced tea in the whole entire world. Seriously, whatever you choose from the menu, try the Pom Tea, its to die for. The menu has some delicious unique options and their wine list is enormous. There aren't many offered just by the glass so since I am a Cabernet girl, I tried the Girard (Napa Valley, CA 2006).. I was a fan. The service was wonderful, and my waiter was very helpful and informative. Also really really good looking so that was a plus. Everyone in here was smiling, laughing and generally enjoying the whole atmosphere. I would really like to come here after work to split a bottle and try the fresh oysters, heirloom carrot soup and Rosemary ravioli they have available at some point too.. now that its so close to my new office and all. :o)Cafe Boa is extremely inexpensive for the options they have, and is pretty much a hidden gem (literally, its kinda hard to find). I see myself returning again and again and again.For 2 years Caffe Boa was my go to HH place.  My friends and I would meet here for many reasons- to celebrate the completion of a big assignment, a new job or promotion, the end of tough a week, a drink before a  VMarie show, Wednesday.  I brought my parents, my in-laws, and friends visiting from out of town to HH here.   It was our spot.What in the name of the Happy Hour gods happened here? I remember a time where you got an entire loaf of bread and a bowl of olive oil.  They replaced that with three dipping sauces and a bread basket...I took it in stride.  Then it just became passed bread, which was rough but I was still able to use the bread to soak up the adriatico sauce.  On my last trip we had to ask several times  for bread.  They used to have so many good wines on HH.  Oh, how I loved those wines.  Now they have a handful of their worst ones.  No more of my favorite Albarino.  No more Cava.Then there was the food.  My friends and I would always order several orders of shrimp adriatico, which was full of plump jumbo shrimp.   The various cheese/tomato based plates were large enough for 4 to share.  What we were served on our last visit was tiny shrimp, that did not seem fresh, in a meager amount of sauce. The capriatta was now a slice of bread with cheese on it and was large enough, maybe, for 2 to cut up and share.  I almost cried when we were last there.  It was a terrible HH in general, made worse by the fact that I sat there knowing how great it once was.  Now my friends and I are in the market for a new HH spot.12/03/09Decided I'd go to CB to find out once and for all what roasted veal marrow tasted like after hearing a couple of Food Network celebrity chefs hark on and on about how wonderful they are (Anne Burrell, in particular, spoke of it on an episode of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate").  I'd have to say that I didn't think much of them.  The presentation was beautiful, I must admit, but paying $10 for what amounted to about a teaspoon and a half (OK, for argument's sake, let's round it off to two teaspoons) of frothy fat accented with Hawai'ian sea salt and tawny port reduction did not translate to a great experience for me (taste, nutrition, or cost).  Sure, there were a bit of bitter greens and three toasted pieces of bread (which two teaspoons of fat could not even cover), but I found more joy and sustenance w/ the singular toast slice slathered w/ goat cheese (forgive me, it's been awhile since I had this app, but the spread could've been mascarpone and ricotta, but I want to say goat cheese) and slices of Campari tomatoes.  Happy hour price for this app was $4.50, which I found easier to swallow, pardon the pun, than to pay $9 for a singular slice of toast w/ a soft-cheese spread and a little bitter greens on top.  (I can't eat tomatoes, so those gourmet slices just ended up in the garbage bin.)  It was very tasty, however, so I may order it again, but I won't be very happy about it.  Perhaps I could get a substitute for the tomatoes?  I will ask next time I go.3.5 stars I see the potential in Caffe Boa. I can see that they've recently changed the menu and the chef and are making strides toward becoming a fantastic restaurant. They just aren't there quite yet, in my opinion. My first visit to the "new" Caffe Boa was the first week the new chef Peyton Curry (formerly of Digestif fame) got started. I walked in to secure a table and was asked for my first and last name...weird right? How many Dottsy's do they get? So I went to sit at the bar to wait for my dinner partner to arrive. I sat and sat and watched the bartender tend to one end of the bar. Finally, a gentleman raised his voice and told the kid that I have been waiting patiently for a drink. A broken glass later, I secured a glass of prosecco. Soon after, my dinner partner arrived and I wanted to cash out because our table was ready. I waved my credit card at the bartender and he took his time coming over. Dude, if you don't want to serve me, then come cash me out so I'm out of your hair! Sheesh. We were seated in the a beautiful dining area. The restaurant was packed with patrons and buzzing. Our waitress came to introduce herself and take our drink orders. I also ordered the pulled mozzarella to start. It arrived at our table and it was just your average mozz. Nothing mind-blowing. For my entree I had the Diver Scallops that were accompanied by a potato puree. The scallops were cooked perfectly. I guess the dish is an exercise in subtlety because nothing wowed me. It was an a-ok dish. It was almost pushing on bland. The puffed capers might have saved the dish. I tried my friend's pasta, and it was semi-cold. He was a better sport than I, and chose not to return it. What threw me was that we were sitting right next to the kitchen door. How long was that pasta sitting in the kitchen getting cold? All in all, the dinner was good. Certainly nothing super creative, but definitely tasty. I returned to Boa for lunch. I ordered the Kobe burger with blue cheese. How do I say this gently? It was a salt lick. The cheese was VERY salty to be put on top of a seasoned burger. I only ate half of it an I was over it. I did fill out a comment card and also told our waitress about it. No offer for a new sandwich, but I did eat half of it. I see the potential for Caffe Boa. It's all there. A good chef, quality ingredients, a creative menu, but they're not all coming together quite right. Maybe a tasting dinner with comment cards might be in order. Or maybe, given time, Caffe Boa will become a roaring success. I will be waiting.Café Boa you've lost me. I vow to never return (except for happy hour). I was disappointed at my last lunch experience and this one takes the cake. You're food has not changed yet every time I go in you jack up the prices and limit my options . I miss my old modest reliable Boa. This new Boa is arrogant and shameless. I went in today, and saw that now my ONLY lunch options are "30 Minute Meals". So choose soup or salad, choose 1 pasta or 1 sandwich and dessert and this does not include a drink.  All for the special price of $19. I felt specially taken advantage of and specially pissed off. It wasn't even any choice of pasta/sandwich, it was Agnolotti Boa or Pastrami. And who do you know that eats dessert for lunch? NO ONE! This new menu is as ridiculous as the prices for average food. Sure there are paninis under $10, but pair that with a salad (not a side salad you have to order a full portion for $9) and the prices make you ponder why you walked in the door.Here's a tip - Go look at the menu at House of Tricks and put yourself in check, or perhaps talk to your manager/chef about coming to reality and getting back to your roots.Oh Caffe Boa, what happened to you? I used to love you, like seriously love you but christ how you've changed! I know, I know, you've gotten yourself a fancy big-named chef and  in turn completely forgotten your identity. Case in point: A $19 lunch SPECIAL? Is that some sort of joke?? Your lunch "special" will run me $20 without even purchasing a drink? Doesn't sound very special to me. Caffe Boa has turned into an expense accounter's establishment only with their insanely unrealistic pricing which has increased dramatically over the last several years. Inflation is one thing but this is price-gouging at its finest. Plain, meatless pasta entrees don't increase in price 60+% over 5 years due to inflation and higher food costs, they just don't.Again, I used to love Caffe Boa. I spent just about every celebratory dinner I had in college there. Shit, I even hosted one of my graduation parties there! But those days are over. I find it incredibly ironic that I used to be able to afford Caffe Boa in college when I was on a strict budget, and years later I'm working and have more disposable funds at my leisure and it has firmly priced itself out of my budget. Crying shame...It took me a while to make my way to Caffe Boa, but I finally did it.  I went for dinner last night with my husband and brother, and we were all impressed!  (We were huge Payton Curry fans when he was at Digestif so I don't know why it took us so long to go see his new home).Despite calling ahead, and several tables appearing open in the dining room, we were sent to the bar when we arrived and told it would be "just a few minutes."  I was ok with that, especially once I had a delicious glass of malbec in my hand!  We were seated about ten or fifteen minutes later, and we must've hit the jackpot because Trevor was our server and he was attentive, friendly, and not afraid to make recommendations.The boys and I had different menu items in mind, so they shared a ton of things (fries and bolgnese as appetizers, a special mangalitsa head cheese as the next course, and then linguini, and quail entrees).  I tried almost all of their courses and ordered the day boat fish, which was sole in parchment paper served with quinoa, as my entree.  My fish was delicious, and quite a large portion too.  So was everything else I tasted except for the head cheese... Sorry Chef, but that was not my cup of tea... it's just not for everyone, I guess!We were all stuffed but managed to share dessert which included an incredible pumpkin macaroon, something chocolate, and caramel corn with fleur de sel.  I let the boys take down the macaroon and chocolate and I enjoyed every morsel of the popcorn!Will definitely be back on a Saturday or Sunday to take advantage of CB's bottomless mimosas / bellinis.Not cool!!!  I've only ever visited the Phoenix location and had outstanding food and service. Tonight has been COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!  We were entertaining clients and the experience couldn't have been worse. I made the reservation for 11 a week in advance. We arrived at 6pm and had clients who had to catch planes at 9pm. It took more than 45 minutes to take our order.  At 8pm after repeated requests on the status of our order and communicating that we had travelers on a tight schedule we were told that one of the entrees was burned and it would take longer.  When we then asked to speak to the manager so we could explain the situation, we were given nothing but attitude. At that point we had had enough and got up to leave.  The owner met us at the door and threatened to call the police if we didn't pay the bill. He then offered to give us $200 in gift certificates. Hmmmmm.... Why can't he just accept his mistake and take care of the bill?  At least we would have given this place a second chance. Instead he refused to provide customer service and told us not to tell him how to run his business!  As we stood outside and argued with him for 15 minutes, 3 other parties left and told us it took over 2 hours for them to get their food. Come on people!  I understand that mistakes happen, but for crying out loud just fix it!!! I will NEVER set foot in this place again, and I'm guessing neither will the other 30 people who exited along with us.I took advantage of the groupon and took a party of 7 for lunch today. The menu online stated "CHOOSE ANY 2 ITEMS, COMBINATION OF SOUP, SALAD, PASTA FOR $9.95" Of course when we got there that was no longer on the menu. We were looking at $16 pastas once again.Not one person in my group was pleased with their meal. I ordered the burger and it was burnt to a crisp as was the bun, my friend ordered the same burger medium and it was burnt on the outside and bloody in the center. I could actually take the burger and only use half of the bun the amount of meat was so small. The pasta salad it was served with was bland, the vegetable sandwich was the ass end of the veggies. All in all everything was less than acceptable. I gave you another chance Boa, and while you boast of fresh quality ingredients you don't deliver on quality food or realistic prices. Sadly I won't be back.
Santisi Brothers=Overhyped and I don't know why.  Unless maybe those kids whose parents used the "electronic babysitter" too much grew up and found a place to feel at home - substitute a beer for the bottle, plop in front of TV.Selection of beers on tap had a couple of nice choices, but c'mon, if I'm going to have to pay $6.75 for a large so-called premium/import draft, I'd better be having a little more skin shaking in my face than I'd care to have from these "Santisi Girls".  I'm sure they're nice young ladies, but I don't see coming here for the benefit of their obligatory company or vacant personalities, even if I was a single horny young 21 yo dude.Saw a few small groups having fun with darts and pool balls, and a few lost souls at the bar.  Mostly I saw a few of the staff working hard (a busser and a waitress) while the rest of the folks in SB tshirts milled around and chit chatted each other up.There weren't many people when I was there kind of late on I can't remember if a Sunday or weeknight.  The lighting was quite bright, allowing me to see all that grime and slime that normally goes unnoticed in this type of place.  What you don't know CAN hurt you, but even so, ignorance is bliss, so I'm only eating in *dimly lit* sports bars from now on.   That lighting is there for a reason, and it's not just to cause you the lovely surprise of waking up hung over next to a sasquatch after a night of binge drinking with your community college "frat" buddies. I need a call out from my man, Flavor-Flav, BOYEEEEEEEE!!, cuz this one's made the Don't Believe the Hype List.I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night.  Yep, I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit.  We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know it's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.For a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.This is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too.Good food, bad service and please keep your opiinions to yourself!I visited this bar because I heard about the good atmosphere, food, and the number of TV's for the many sports you can watch.  I favorite thing is that it cooks that good old world Italian food.  I lived in Kansas City where there is a good amount of Italians there and being in Arizona that food seems hard to find.  Santisit's has that good Italian family food packaged in a sports bar and not the traditional Italian family restaurant.  Kudos for that now on to the next.  I visited this place twice over the last week and have received bad service and got insulted on the second visit.  On 07/19 with my fiancee.  We ordered a antipasto salad and a stromboli.  We arrived at 3pm and did not receive our order until 3:45.  I believe the only reason we received that because they over heard the conversation that I was going to leave if the food was not out by 3:45.  I was surprised it took so long to bring the food out and especially a salad.  They could have just brought that out first since that was so simple to make.  We were out on Lake Pleasant that day out in the hot sun for about 4 hours and we grew an appetite.  However, we received the food and it was great.  I visited this place again on 07/23 for happy hour after doing some after hours work and I felt really insulted by the bartender that day and I didn't finish my food that day.  I arrived at there around 5:30pm and order a Michelob Ultra and a stromboli again.  Keep in mind that I am a heavyset guy and my bartender was a skinny 130lbs older lady probably around in her 50's.  She brings my order and looks at the plate and makes a remark saying, "That would last me about 3 days".  I did not understand why she said that but I paid it no mind until I was ready to go.  I only ate half of the plate and when I asked her to package my plate she makes another remark, "I'm suprised you didn't eat the whole thing".  I left the place shocked and insulted.  It took a lot to keep me from cursing this lady out.  I could not believe that she would inpose her opinion on me because I'm heavyset that I just gouge food.  I know that there is a LOT of peope here who gets crazy about this FAT phobia but if it does not affect you, the please don't worry about it.  It's my life and I can do what I want to do.  In addition, you are not a medical professional and you don't know why a person is overweight to begin with.  Even the doctor's themselves do not completely know what causes a person to be overweight becasue if they did 80 percent of adult Americans would not be fat.  This bar really pissed me off and I will not ever go back there again.  On the first time, shame on me but a second time, shame on you.  If the food wasn't good I would probably rate this place a one star.  Please train your staff to pay attention to your customers and be more couretous.  Thanks.
Petes Fish & Chips=My daughter brought me here for a belated Father's day lunch. Wow! I couldn't believe my eyes. Almost drove right by. Complete and total make over inside and out. Even a new electric sign out front. They must have got new deep fryers too...the food tasted better than usual. You can actually see shrimp inside the crust. I got a 7 piece lunch combo. (5 shrimp and 2 oysters) with a pile of fries and Pete's sauce. I brought some Tabasco with me to spice it up a little.  My daughter had the 3 piece fish and chips. Everything was hot and crispy and the oysters were plump and juicy. Make sure you bring cash though, CASH ONLY! They have an ATM on site but will hit you up for $2.50. I will be returning more often cash in hand. Hope you all do the same. Order the oysters...Plump and juicy but be careful when you bite into it or you will squirt hot juice everywhere!  ENJOY!Came back again on Mon. around noon with my 2 daughters and grand daughter in tow for our Pete's fix. Nothing much has changed from my previous reviews and updates save two! The shrimp are now a little smaller overall but larger pieces of shrimp inside the batter and the prices have gone up! Our order of fish combo (2 fish, 5 shrimp and fries), 7 piece shrimp and fries and 8 piece chicken nuggets came to $21.80 not counting $2  ATM charge for cash. Got our food quickly and piping hot even during lunch rush! Be careful if you go, lots of road work on Van Buren in front of Pete's and other businesses! Prob be awhile for our next fix!
Las Islitas=It's the last day to claim those Entertainment book coupons and after finding out Siena Bistro was closed for a private event, we headed to Las Islitas #3.  Their banner outside advertised lunch specials starting from $5.99, Monday through Friday.   I had already called ahead and learned that their seafood dishes were not part of the coupon special.  After looking through their menu, it left us with very few choices.  (Their specialty is seafood, so the majority of the menu had some kind of seafood in it.)  On the back page of the menu were a few meat dishes so we stuck with that selection.The waitress had already brought over tortilla chips, salsa, and fresh limes.  (The Big F really liked their tortilla chips and I found their salsa with just the right amount of heat.)  We were more than hungry by the time our food arrived.The Big F ordered the Carne en su Jugo ($14.95) "beef stew with bacon, onion and green sauce" - The first thing I tried was their refried beans and was impressed.  Sure, they don't give much rice, and they really should give more beans because it's that good!  It's so creamy and unlike other refried beans I've had.  The Big F thought the beef stew was different, and liked it a lot.  His plate was licked clean.I tried their Fajitas de Res ($14.95) "beef fajitas" - It came with either corn or flour tortillas, and I chose the flour kind.  Chunky pieces of beef with red and green bell peppers, onions, and some other red vegetable.  It was a pretty filling dish, and I had enough for leftovers.  The Big F found the beef to be a bit dry, but I loaded it with salsa and hot sauce, so I couldn't really tell.We were definitely curious about their seafood dishes since we saw other diners enjoying themselves on generous dishes of ceviche.  Overall, we were surprisingly pleased with our lunch.  We went in the afternoon, so it wasn't too busy.  We were probably more bugged with the 'no seafood' part, so we couldn't really enjoy what they offered if we wanted to take advantage of that coupon.  Oh well.  Next time!American Express not accepted.3.5 stars.(Pics posted!)
Dos Gringos=In light of the recent news and video of a Dos Gringos bouncer punching a patron in the face, I thought I should ring in on this establishment....This bar treats its customers like they are college kids. I suppose they are somewhat justified in this since it is typically a younger crowd. I've had mixed experiences coming here... in the past, I've had acceptable and decent service here, but the last several times I've been there the service has gotten progressively worse. On the last occasion, they took forever to take my drink order and then poured me the wrong drink... then when I went to politely return the full glass of whatever and get what I ordered, they refused to re-make it. I left it on the bar and they threw it away (keeping my money of course) and gave me a dirty look. I also had aggressive bar backs shove me out of the way. That experience alone was enough for me to never go back, but it wasn't an isolated incident. It wasn't always that way though... The staff in general here all seem to be complete assholes, but I can almost recall a time when they were decent to me - back in the 1990s. It's a pity because this bar is in a great building and has a fun layout. It's breezy and open and conducive to having a good time drinking after work with your buddies. My old roommate used to hit this place often with his corporate pals and he loved the atmosphere. They do make their drinks pretty strong, so maybe he was too trashed to care about the bad service. In their defense, their patrons are often rowdy, young, and unruly - so that's probably why it has evolved into this. I've found the Tempe location to be more laid back though, so it's still pretty excessive if you ask me. I have to give this place an extra star because it's still a good place for young folks to go grab a beer and chill. I think this punch in the face incident may get them to reevaluate their staff and maybe give them all sensitivity training or something. It can only get better from here.As a first time Yelper, I thought it was my duty to pick out the most memorable experience from my recent jaunt to the Scottsdale bars to house my post.  I am not what you would call a bar fly.  I am more of a stay at home, curled up with a book kind of gal. The whole "Scottsdale Scene" leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  On this particular Friday night I was torn from the solace of my couch by a group of friends for a night on the town.  We began our evening in the Northeast part of Old Town amongst the neon lights of the newly constructed string of bars.  Giddy with anticipation of what our night would bring, we strolled into HIFI.  Being a stranger to the nightlife I was disappointed to find the service rude.  The bartenders seemed almost put out that I had the audacity to order a cocktail.  Let alone, the ever complicated vodka soda with a lemon.  I was assured by the rest of my group that was par for the course and I should be thankful the bartender chose to bestow her attention on me instead of the bar-back she was previously talking to. Far be it from me to rock the boat I smiled, thanked her, apologized to the bar-back and drank my $10 drink in silence, eyes cast to the floor.  Rinse and repeat for the next 2 hours on that side of town.  Some places better than others, though all having an air of superiority I didn't quite understand.  Fast forward to midnight, tired of battling aggressive V necks, we made our way across Scottsdale road.  The bright neon lights from the eastside of the street had nothing on the sparkling Christmas lights of Craftsman Court.  Making our way into Dos Gringos we were greeted at the door by a bearded gent with a friendly, "Hello."   This is one of the larger bars I have been to in Scottsdale.  There were 3 different bars operating downstairs and one upstairs, which was not open on this particular night.  The place was crowded, yet we were promptly served with a smile as soon as we stepped up to the bar.  The tall red headed fellow handled my intricate concoction of vodka and soda water with ease.  We made our way to the back of the bar. The atmosphere was very inviting. The rhythm was right, I had my dancin' shoes on and me and your girl was booty shakin'.  There was more room in the back so our group posted up here for the rest of the night.  The music was excellent and all of the patrons seemed to be having a fantastic time, ourselves included.  All the bartenders, guys and gals alike, made us feel welcome and seemed happy to have us there. We were never without a beverage, and I never felt I was putting anyone out to have my glass refilled.  Fueled with laughs, the warmth of friendship, and something called Fireball, the sobering task of closing my tab crept up on me in the night.  I reached for the black check presenter with fear in my heart.  Already taking mental stock of my unpaid bills for the month, I opened the small book at the same time deciding Southwest Gas would have to wait for their money yet another paycheck. I was pleasantly surprised at the affordability of the libations.  My cat Gary and I would stay warm in spite of my poor decision making skills.  I paid my bill, left a generous tip, one that I thought was well deserved and was a direct reflection on the service I had received, and staggered my way into a taxi in the back ally.  I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a pretentious-free night out on the town.  Thank you Dos Gringos and staff for making one the few nights that I get out a great one!  I'll be back for sure.
Hot Dog Heaven=I hadn't been to this place in over 12 years so I decided to take hubby to try it out and see if it was still any good. There is no drive-thru, this is a small little building where you walk-up and place your order. If there is actual parking for this place someone let me know because it seems people still just pull up along the curb, hop out and order, get their food then roll out. I just figure the parking situation adds adventure to the experience ha! There is seating right outside of the ordering window which is nice, if mother nature is being nice :)As I walked up to the window I immediately recognized the owner. He is a character for sure! He let me know he was celebrating 18 years in the same location. I told him I had read in the Review Journal a few years back that Celine Dion liked to stop at Hot Dog Heaven for a hot dog on her way home. The owner had an immediate response that had both my husband and myself laughing so hard! I'd repeat what he said, but it might not be appropriate so just trust me it was hilarious or ask yourself next time you stop by! So I ordered a "Vienna All Beef Hot Dog" priced at $2.79 on the menu board, but I was charged $2.89 before taxes. It's only 10 cents, but still the prices should be listed correctly. I asked for mine loaded so it came on a poppy seed bun and had a pickle, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers and true green relish. I asked for the celery salt to be left off.  This hot dog was as good as I remembered it. It really is a simple thing yet hits the spot. I also ordered "Chili Cheese Fries" priced at $4.19 and the chili cheese fries only come in one size unlike the plain fries. The chili cheese fries can easily be shared between 2 or more people. The chili is made from scratch and being a Chicago joint there is no beans in the chili. The chili was pretty good, but not as good as Original Tommy's. The fries are nice and fat so they hold up the chili and cheese nicely. Hubby ordered a "Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog" that was priced on the menu at $4 and some change, yet I was charged $5.19 for it before tax. Look, I really don't mind paying whatever you are charging if it is fair, but it needs to be posted correctly or it is just misleading and people will wonder about shadiness. They serve Coca-Cola here as well Barq's root beer if that is your thing.They only take CA$H MONEY for payment, so stop at a bank or have some cash on you because cash is king at this place.
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=Cuz a foot isn't long enough!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1bALsE6aZE23mGV2WPxN_g?select=anOeubumuKq8jHiIMbHi3wI had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. It feels alot more family run and friendly here.Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami! * about 7 min from the strip a little past the PalmsCute little sandwich shop behind the McDonalds on Decatur & flamingo, small but still kinda cozy, the people that work here are cool and friendly. I got a small meal (the Bobbie meal) so the price was cheap... they don't have sprite, coke, Pepsi, just Mountain Dew & 7up. They don't have any 'name brand chips' here either which isn't a big deal at all to the norm but if your a foodie like me... I like to have my variety of flavorful chips. I wanted to see what all the buzz about the Bobbie was about, I liked the combination of cranberry, stuffing, turkey, & mayo (because you can't even taste the mayo) but it honestly wasn't a wow factor. It was a good meal with okay prices, next time ill bring my hot sauce bottle. P.S. they don't carry avocado.
Baja Fresh Mexican Grill=What you gonna do? It's fast food. Very basic and devoid of character.  The only saving grace here is the communal salsa bar.  Sure fine, this place is alright, not disgusting or the best ever.  Just as average as you can get.
