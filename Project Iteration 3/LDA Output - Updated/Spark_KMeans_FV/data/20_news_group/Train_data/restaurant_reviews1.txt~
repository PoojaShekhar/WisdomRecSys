Review Text :
I'm so over T-Bones.I used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.I'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks.Great atmosphere and location, but the food is sad, just sad. Won't be coming back. It's fine if you want to enjoy a few beers by the water, but don't come hungry.What on earth has happened to T Bones?! This used to be an awesome place back in the late 90's and I used to hang here all the time.  It's been years and years since I have been and wanted to take my husband for dinner. The first thing that hits you is the smell when you walk in the lobby.  It's fishy, but it's not coming from the lake.  The place needs a complete professional, deep detailed cleaning. There is dust and cobwebs everywhere and a thick film of just nastiness on the surfaces.  The menus are dirty and sticky. They were not busy. Our waitress was young and was way more interested with her phone and the male waitstaff than providing us good service. I remembered the filet tips being amazing and my husband wanted to try something new so he got a peanut chicken sandwich. The filet tip meal did not come with a salad and was almost $20.  That was pretty lame. We got our food and it was on dollar store plates and very sad looking.  The portions were small and the peppers, mushrooms and onions that were with my tips were overcooked and soggy and the steak was overcooked.  I was bummed. My husband was so confused with his sandwich.  It was a small piece of dry chicken with weird slaw, hot sauce and a HUGE scoop of peanut butter - the ingredients did not go together at all.  We would have told the waitress, but she didn't come back until we were almost done. I did ask for bread because I also remember it being awesome and should have came with my meal.  It was old and cold and was sitting in a sad basket wrapped with a old linen.  It was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife. We used our hands to share it.In short, this place has gone waaaaay down hill over the years and the owners don't seem to care. It's dirty, overpriced and the service is poor. I guess it is just another spot (like all the other bars in Lake Wylie) for locals to sit and drink outside. It's too bad, I remember when there would be a line out the door and inside and outside would be packed on the weekends and the food was really good. Nice location, but I will never go back again.One star!  Let me begin by saying I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened, sometime in early 90's.  It appears that the joint hasn't been remodeled or thoroughly cleaned since opening day.  The place is absolutely filthy.  Really had a hard time not just walking out, but I wasn't alone so I stuck it out.  Terrible atmosphere.  Very musty, all the decorations appear to be from the early 90's.  The windows are dirty.  The floors are dirty.  The doors are sticky.  You can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned.  So now to the food.  I had a Carolina burger. It was tasteless, unseasoned, and poorly made.  Tasted nothing like a Carolina burger should.  The slaw had carrots in it which is weird on a burger and I've never seen carrots in homemade burger cole slaw.  The chili was tasteless.  The bun was tasteless.  Bad all the way around.  The burger was low grade meat, more suited for McDonalds and truthfully tasted worse than a McDonalds burger but cost me 10.00.  What a sham.  That burger cost them 2.00 and they charged 9.99.  Which I'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty.  Pitiful excuse for a restaurant. No leadership in this place.  I really don't understand this business plan because they are adjacent to some of the highest value homes in Charlotte.  Just clean the place and serve fresh food.  I'll never return.As a bar with a nice view of the Lake, it's not bad although the lake is way down at this point and a large amount of the grassy area around the restaurant were under two to six feet of water six months ago.Meet a former colleage from work for lunch today.  I had their version of a Cuban called a Pork Loin Sandwich.  Not bad except for the cole slaw.  I know cole slaw is a Carolina thiing but you don't have to put it on everything.  Otherwise it was excellent and the fries that came with it were pretty good as well.My friend  had a pound of wings with hot sauce and he really enjoyed them.Food was OK, not outstanding, the bar scene was good and the servers were outstanding. We ate at the bar on the outside deck and it was pleasant.  Warm but not too hot with a great view.
