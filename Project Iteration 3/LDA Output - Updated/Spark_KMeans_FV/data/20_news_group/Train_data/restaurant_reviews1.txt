Review Text :
I'm so over T-Bones.I used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.
  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.
  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  
And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  
The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.I'm sorry, T-Bones.  
We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.
